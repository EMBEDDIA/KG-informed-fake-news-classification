"""President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who  now sits on the Supreme Court."" U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement  last week, and while President Obama has not yet announced his nominee,  U.S. senators are already discussing prospects of a filibuster.
Democrats  in the Senate hold 59 votes, one short of the 60 needed to bring  nominees or legislation to an up or down vote.
Republican Sen.  Jon Kyl of Arizona, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he thought  a filibuster was unlikely, but he wasn't taking it entirely off the  table as an option. Kyl appeared on ABC News' This Week, alongside  Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York.
""President Obama  himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the  Supreme Court,"" Kyl said. ""So if the president isn't going to take it  off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it  can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that  Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that  with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues  to support his position or her position.""
We wanted to examine  whether Kyl was correct about Obama's position on then-Judge Samuel  Alito back in 2006, when Obama was a senator and Alito was President  George W. Bush's nominee.
We found that Obama did join a broader  Democratic effort to filibuster Alito. Democrats said Alito opposed  abortion and was too deferential to executive power.
But in  what's become Obama's trademark on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand  style, he joined the filibuster while at the same time saying he thought  it was a bad idea.
Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on  Jan. 29, 2006:
Stephanopoulos: ""Two of your colleagues, Senator  (Edward) Kennedy and Senator (John) Kerry, want to try to mount a  filibuster tomorrow. Will you join them?""
Obama: ""Well, I will be  supporting the filibuster because I think Judge Alito, in fact, is  somebody who is contrary to core American values, not just liberal  values, you know. When you look at his decisions in particular during  times of war, we need a court that is independent and is going to  provide some check on the executive branch, and he has not shown himself  willing to do that repeatedly. I will say this, though, I think that  the Democrats have to do a much better job in making their case on these  issues. These last-minute efforts using procedural maneuvers inside the  Beltway, I think, has been the wrong way of going about it, and we need  to recognize, because Judge Alito will be confirmed, that if we're  going to oppose a nominee that we've got to persuade the American people  that, in fact, their values are at stake and frankly I'm not sure that  we've successfully done that.""
Stephanopoulos: ""Well, it sounds  to me like you're not really happy about going forward and joining this  filibuster. And I've actually seen some reports that inside the  Democratic caucus you were arguing against this strategy. Is that true?""
Obama:  ""Well, you know, I don't talk about what I, you know, what takes place  in caucus but what I will say is that there is an over-reliance on the  part of Democrats for procedural maneuvers and mechanisms to block the  president instead of proactively going out to the American people and  talking about the values that we care about. And, you know, there's one  way to guarantee that the judges who are appointed to the Supreme Court  are judges that reflect our values and that's to win elections.""
Later  that day, a report from the Associated Press carried the headline,  ""Sen. Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic.""
The next day,  Democrats failed in their attempt to filibuster on a vote of 72 to 25,  with Obama  joining 24 other Democrats on the losing end.
Obama may  have criticized the filibuster even as he joined it, but at the end of  the day, he still joined it. Kyl said, ""President Obama himself  attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme  Court.",1,Jon Kyl
"In Hawaii, ""they don't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office."" On ABC's This Week, the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic  national parties debated the significance of Republican Charles Djou's  victory in a Hawaii congressional special election on May 22, 2010 -- the  first time a Republican will represent Hawaii in Congress since 1991.
RNC  Chairman Michael Steele called the victory significant, given Hawaii's  penchant for supporting Democrats, and he noted that the state is the  birthplace of President Barack Obama (Sorry, birthers).
Of  course, DNC Chairman Tim Kaine had a different read. He said Djou's  victory was more about the unique circumstances of the special election -- which was called to replace the resigning Rep. Neil Abercrombie until the regular fall election --   than a political mood swing in Hawaii. The special election did not  include a primary, which meant parties could field multiple candidates.  Of the three main contenders, two were Democrats while Djou was the lone  Republican. He won with a little under 40 percent of the overall vote.
""In  the November election, it will be one Democrat against one Republican,  and we feel very, very confident about winning that race,"" Kaine said.
But  Steele countered, Hawaii doesn't ""have a history of throwing incumbents  out of office.""
It's an obvious fact that incumbents have an  easier road to re-election than challengers. Since 1964, no less than 85  percent of incumbents have been returned to the U.S. House, according  to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since 1998, incumbents'  re-election rate has hovered between 94 and 98 percent in the House. The  numbers in the Senate are a little lower -- between 79 and 96 percent  in elections since 1998.
But do incumbents have an even easier  time getting re-elected in America's youngest state?
Since Hawaii  wasn't incorporated as a state until 1959, there isn't a lot of history  to examine. And since Hawaii has just four members of Congress (two  senators and two members of the U.S. House), there are relatively few  elections to scour.
In fact, only 5 people have represented the  state in the U.S. Senate: the two sitting senators, Democrats Daniel  Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and three others -- Republican Hiram Fong,  Democrat Spark Matsunaga and Democrat Oren E. Long. None of them lost a  re-election campaign for the Senate -- Fong and Long retired and  Matsunaga died in office.
Hawaii's two congressional House  districts were created in 1971. Previously both seats had been elected  at large.
Djou will represent Hawaii's 1st District, the second  Republican ever to do so. He replaces Abercrombie, a 10-term  Democrat who resigned to run for governor. The state's 2nd District has  never elected a Republican.
Have any incumbents lost?
Not  really.
In the 2nd District, Patsy Mink, Daniel Akaka and Ed Case  all resigned or retired in order to run for another office. Mink was  eventually re-elected to the U.S. House and died in office.
In  the 1st District, Spark Matsunaga, Cecil Heftel, Pat Saiki and  Abercrombie all also resigned to run for another office.
There's  one asterisk. Abercrombie was first elected to Congress in 1986 in a  special election just like Djou. But though he won the special election,  he lost his party's primary to run for a full, two-year term on the  very same day.
We counted and found about 50 elections where the  incumbent on Hawaii was on the ballot. The closest anyone got to losing  was Abercrombie in 1986, but he wasn't actually an incumbent when he  lost the Democratic primary.
Depending how you count it, that  puts the re-election rate in Hawaii between 98 percent and 100 percent,  which is higher than the national average over the same period.
Though  Steele was talking about federal races, we also checked to see if an  incumbent Hawaii governor ever lost a bid for re-election. It happened  once since Hawaii became a state, in 1962, when Republican William Quinn  lost to Democrat John Burns.
Back to the statement by RNC  Chairman Steele. He said Hawaiians don't have a history of  throwing incumbents out of office and said that Djou's election  to Congress in May means Republicans have a good shot of keeping the  seat in November. While we're not in the business of predicting the  outcome of House races, no incumbent has ever lost a November  congressional election in Hawaii.",1,Michael Steele
"""Our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years."" Ever since Barack Obama became president and began advocating such big-dollar federal programs as an economic stimulus and health care reform, Republicans have gained increasing political traction with warnings to voters about the growing national debt.
On March 24, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register that was timed to coincide with a March 25 visit by Obama to Iowa City, Iowa. Obama visited Iowa City to tout the health care bill two days after signing it into law.
Boehner's column -- titled, ""Why Republicans will fight to repeal health care takeover"" -- was a broadside against the newly signed bill, featuring a wide range of statistics. In it, he asserted that the health care bill ""is a recipe for further fiscal disaster at a time when our national debt ($12.7 trillion today) is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy (about $15 trillion) in just two more years.""
That struck us as a huge amount, so we decided to take a closer look.
First, we'll offer a reminder that the debt is different from a deficit. A deficit refers to the amount by which expenses exceed revenues in a single year. The debt -- which is what Boehner was referring to -- refers to the cumulative total of past deficits, minus any intervening surpluses.
To sort out whether Boehner's numbers are right, we turned to the extensive historical tables in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal.
According to these figures, which come from the Office of Management and Budget, the gross federal debt by the end of fiscal year 2010 is projected to be almost $13.8 trillion. That's actually a bit more than Boehner had suggested.
Two years later -- by the end of fiscal year 2012 -- the debt is projected to rise to $16.3 trillion, also higher than Boehner had indicated.
But Boehner is correct that, measured by the share of gross domestic product, gross federal debt will reach a significant milestone in two years. By 2012, gross federal debt is projected to be 100.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from 99.0 percent for fiscal year 2011.
These numbers, we'll add, have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.
It's worth noting that there is an alternative measure of debt known as ""public debt,"" which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Measured this way, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent.
Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, but one measure ""isn’t more 'right' than the other – they are just looking at different things,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group. ""Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way.""
It's also worth noting that these numbers are only estimates. They could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we consider Boehner's statistics valid. While he underestimates the size of the projected debt in 2010 and 2012, his assertion that ""our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years"" is on target, according to the president's own Office of Management and Budget.",1,John Boehner
"""Health insurance companies' costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending."" As the battle over health care reform approaches a climax, America's Health Insurance Plans -- the trade group for the private health insurance industry -- began airing a new ad highlighting statistics on what actually goes into the nation's health care spending.
Here's the full text of AHIP's ad:
""What's inside the health care cost pie? Some in Washington say it's all health insurance. But health care insurance is one of the smallest slices. Health insurance companies' costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending. Doctors, hospitals, medicines and tests are the biggest slices, and a government report says their rising prices are the primary driver of higher health care costs. If Washington wants to make health care more affordable, they need to look at the whole health care pie, not just a slice.""
This ad touches on a bunch of controversial and complex issues in just 30 seconds. But for our fact-check, we'll focus on a narrow question: Is AHIP correct when it says that ""health insurance companies' costs amount to only 4 percent of all health care spending""?
We looked at data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Every year, CMS's Office of the Actuary produces statistics on ""national health expenditures"" and the items that make up those purchases. That's the source that AHIP cited in the ad, and one that's considered credible by independent experts.
The full breakdown for 2008 is posted on the CMS Web site. We'll recap the data here.
In 2008, total national health expenditures in the United States -- the combination of money spent by consumers out of pocket, by private insurers and by local, state and federal governments -- exceeded $2.3 trillion. Of that, $92 billion went for the cost of private health insurance. ""Cost"" in this case refers to overhead and profits -- not to any of the dollars that are funneled through insurers' accounts on behalf of their patients. It also excludes any overhead by government-run insurers such as CMS itself, which signs the checks for Medicare and Medicaid.
If you divide private insurance costs by total expenditures, it works out to 3.9 percent -- almost exactly what AHIP said. For comparison's sake, hospitals accounted for 30.7 percent of spending, professional services (including doctors, nurses, dentists and other clinical services) accounted for 31.3 percent, and retail sales of drugs and other medical products accounted for 12.8 percent.
To see whether the figures for 2009 changed the equation much, we checked in with John A. Poisal, deputy director of national health statistics in the CMS actuary's office. He said the updated but not-yet-posted numbers were nearly $2.5 trillion in total expenditures and $90.2 billion in insurance costs. That works out to 3.6 percent. Rounded up, that's once again as AHIP portrayed it.
Next, we scrutinized the total health expenditure figure. In addition to including such factors as doctors, hospitals and medicines, this amount includes dollars spent on nursing homes and home health care; governmental public health activities; medical research; and medical-related construction projects. Since these items are somewhat extraneous to the costs that AHIP is discussing in its ad, we decided to run the numbers without these factors included.
For 2008, insurance costs divided by health expenditures other than those removed above amounted to 4.8 percent. Even when rounded up, 5 percent is close to the 4 percent AHIP cited, and it's a percentage far below what hospitals, doctors and pharmaceuticals claimed.
For 2009, the numbers are much the same, working out to 4.5 percent.
We weighed whether it made any sense to divide private insurance costs by total private health insurance expenditures -- a number that excludes all expenses paid by the government, by consumers out of their own pockets, and by other private sources, such as foundations. When you make that calculation, the answer is 11.7 percent for 2008 and 11.1 percent in 2009 -- almost three times as high as AHIP's cited rate.
Ultimately, though, we concluded that AHIP's numbers more accurately reflect the question it poses. When you're asking what health expenditures could conceivably be trimmed for cost-control purposes, there's no reason to exempt Medicare, Medicaid and other non-private expenditures from consideration.
Even if it's correct, not everyone in the health policy arena believes that AHIP's calculation is relevant.
Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said ""what we should be looking at is the insurer return to capital. ... They make a lot of money relative to what they invest, and they do almost nothing for that money to hold down the growth in health care spending.""
Meanwhile, some critics suggest that when AHIP points the finger at doctors and hospitals for health care cost inflation, it ignores its own role. Insurers, after all, sign the checks and could presumably use greater leverage to keep costs down.
However, our conclusion here doesn't argue one way or another on the question of whether private health insurance could be run more efficiently, whether private insurers should take on a bigger or a smaller role in the health care system, or whether more money should be spent for, say, doctors instead of insurance costs. We are merely checking whether AHIP provided accurate figures to answer the question it raised. And as far as we can tell, the group did.",1,America's Health Insurance Plans
"""We can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47."" In the wake of a foiled car bomb attempt in Times Square, New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg went to Washington on May 5, 2010, to lobby for legislation he  hopes will keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.
""It's amazing but true:  we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't  have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47,"" Bloomberg wrote  in an op-ed for the Huffington Post the same day.
Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.,  echoed the claim in a Senate hearing : ""The stark fact is that the  United States Department of Justice has no authority to block the sale of  firearms to suspected terrorists even when the department knows they are about  to purchase guns.""
Really?
Between February 2004 and February 2010, FBI data shows that people on the terrorist watch list  went through the background check process to purchase firearms or explosives  1,225 times; and that 1,116 (about 91 percent) of the purchases were allowed to  proceed because no ""prohibiting information"" was found such as felony  convictions, illegal immigrant status, those dishonorably discharged from the armed forces or people adjudicated as mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution.
A report  from the U.S. Government Accountability Office shows Bloomberg is right:  ""Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from  possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law.""
But that doesn't mean  these purchases go unnoticed by the feds.
When a person on the ""Known or Appropriately  Suspected Terrorists"" list applies to buy a firearm, it sets off notifications  to various law enforcement and counterterrorism intelligence groups, according  to the FBI assistant director Daniel D. Roberts' testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs on May 5, 2010.
""In this situation, in  a given investigation, the attempt may, in combination with other factors, lead  to enhanced investigative methods, such as surveillance,"" Roberts stated. ""What  the attempt to buy a firearm means in a counterterrorism investigation, and as a  result the subsequent actions it warrants, necessarily must be evaluated on a  case-by-case basis.""
But if no ""federally prohibitive information"" is  uncovered, the purchases are allowed to proceed.
Sen. Frank Lautenberg,  D-N.J., has introduced legislation to close the so-called ""terror gap"" in the  nation's gun laws. Under the law, the FBI would be given the latitude to deny  firearms and explosives sales to people on the suspected terrorist lists. Anyone  denied a purchase could appeal to the courts to overturn it. The bill has the  support of 500 mayors who are members of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against  Illegal Guns.
But  it's not a slam dunk. Some legislators have raised constitutional issues with  the proposal.
""Before we subject innocent Americans who have done  nothing but have the wrong name at the wrong time having to go to court and pay  the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back, I want to slow down and  think about it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in the Senate hearing .
""There's a difference between losing your rights  based on a felony charge that has been proven in a court of law and appealed and  is a conviction in the books, and being on some list that's at best suspect,""  Graham said.
""We're talking about a second amendment right,""  Graham said. ""Some of the people pushing this idea are pushing the idea of  banning handguns. And I don't think banning handguns makes me safer.""
Whether the law makes  sense is a political matter. But unless or until the proposed law is enacted,  there is no dispute that the FBI currently does not have the power to block  suspected terrorists from buying dynamite or an AK-47, as Bloomberg said, unless  they have some other disqualifying factor such as a felony conviction on their  record. And, in fact, people on the terror watch list have been able to purchase firearms or explosives more than a thousand times in the past six  years. The purchases may trigger ""enhanced investigative methods"" from the FBI,  but the sales are allowed just the same.",1,Michael Bloomberg
"On military recruiters at Harvard, Elena Kagan ""took a position and the  Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" One of Elena Kagan's top credentials -- that she was dean of Harvard Law  School -- created some controversy on the day that President Barack  Obama announced her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
As  dean, Kagan took a lead role in trying to keep military recruiters off  campus because of the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents gays  and lesbians from serving openly in the military. Several Republicans pointed  to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan, calling the incident  troubling. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also pointed out that the  incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling.
At  Harvard Law School, Barrasso said, ""She took a position and the Supreme  Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" Barrasso said he was  keeping an open mind on the nomination.
We were interested in  fact-checking his statement that the Supreme Court ""ruled unanimously  that she was wrong.""
The controversy over military recruiters  began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003. Harvard was  one of several top-tier law schools that attempted to ban military  recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from  serving openly in the military.
In 2003, Kagan penned a letter  to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue:
""I  abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance  of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that  members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this  discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives  many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity  to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound  wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that  tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members  cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their  country.""
Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools  that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon  Amendment, named for Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and first passed in  1996. Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the  intervening years, with some schools providing partial access. But  eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case  known as Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, known  as FAIR. FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon  Amendment.
In her role as a professor of law at Havard, Kagan  signed onto an amicus brief (sometimes known as a ""friend of the court""  brief) filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal  government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied  the same policies to all recruiters. Harvard, for example, required all  recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against  applicants based on sexual orientation. The withholding of funds  interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they  felt were discriminatory policies.
The Harvard law professors  argued in their brief that ""this case is not -- and has never been --  about whether law schools may 'discriminate' against the military or  whether they must provide 'equal access' to military recruiters.  Instead, the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon  military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral  and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a school's failure to  make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military  recruiting. The answer is 'no.'""
The Supreme Court, however,  disagreed in an 8-0 ruling on March 6, 2006. The majority opinion,  written by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled against FAIR and, in doing  so, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the  school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the  military. ""Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same  access as recruiters who comply with the policy,"" the opinion said.
The  court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law  schools' treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment. If the action  itself were purely expressive, the court reasoned, the schools would  not have to issue statements explaining their actions. The court  compared the situation to someone who says he won't pay his income taxes  because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service. The disapproval  is protected speech, but the non-payment of taxes is not.
The  opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia,  Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and  Stephen Breyer joining Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito did not  participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral  arguments were made.
Barrasso said Kagan ""took a position and  the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" The court did  reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR  and the brief filed by the Harvard professors. All of the justices who  voted opposed the law schools' arguments.",1,John Barrasso
"John Paul Stevens is the only Protestant on the U.S. Supreme Court. And then there were none.
On the April 12, 2010, episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert pointed out that ""the departure of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens will leave an unsual void.""
""Stevens is the last Protestant,"" Colbert said to his guest, legal expert Jeffrey Toobin. ""When he's gone, who will speak for the people in Bermuda shorts?""
In fact, much has been made of Stevens' religion since he announced his retirement on April 9. Once he steps down -- and unless President Barack Obama appoints another Protestant to take his place -- there will be no more Protestants on the bench. Justice David Souter, who left the court in 2009, is Episcopalian, a religion that combines both Protestant and Catholic traditions. He was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Catholic.
In addition to Sotomayor, five of the justices are Catholic, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.
Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsberg are Jewish.
So, why all this discussion of Stevens' religious affiliation? If anything, it says a lot about how the demographics of the court have changed over the years. Historically speaking, the religious affiliations of the current court are quite unusual, according to a report and study done by NPR's Nina Totenberg. For decades, the court was majority Protestant, she reports. It was Catholics and Jews who were the anomaly.
That shift is even more pronounced when you look at the nation's religious affiliations. According to the CIA World Factbook, a little more 50 percent of Americans identify as Protestant. Catholics make up about 24 percent of the population, while Jews represent about 1.7 percent of the population.
So, back to Colbert's claim. He's correct that Stevens is a Protestant and he's the last one on the Supreme Court bench. Colbert's first statement on the Truth-O-Meter gets a True.",1,Stephen Colbert
"""Crime is down in Arizona."" The debate about immigration often involves discussions about whether  illegal immigrants cause more crime.
The topic came up on ABC's  This Week on July 4, 2010, when Al Hunt, the executive editor in  Washington for Bloomberg News, criticized John McCain for the Republican  senator's comments about crime in Arizona.
McCain had explained  his shift on immigration by saying, ""The violence is incredibly high.  The human smuggling and drug cartels are at a level of violence where  25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have been murdered in the last few  years, 5,000 already this year. There's a level of violence which has  increased to a significant degree, which makes the situation far  different than it was in 2007"" when the Senate last considered immigration reform.
He added, ""But I invite the  president to come to the border, and he can see for himself the absolute  necessity of getting our border secure before more violence spills over  onto our side of the border... It is not the same as it was in 2007.  And the people deserve not to have our ranchers murdered, not to have a  deputy shot by a drug smuggler with an AK-47 in Pinal County. The  situation has dramatically changed, and the statistics absolutely back  that up.""
During the roundtable discussion on This Week, Hunt  told host Jake Tapper: ""I must say, John McCain, in his interview with  you, Jake, that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's  talking about Mexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic  study that's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes.""
It  is unclear whether McCain was suggesting that crime in Arizona was up  because of illegal immigrants, but we were curious about Hunt's claim  that crime in Arizona -- a state that ranks 6th for the estimated  population of illegal immigrants -- was down.
Because Hunt did  not specify the types of crime, we'll examine all types.
We  checked the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports as well as data from Arizona's  Department of Public Safety and found Hunt is correct that crime is  down.
From 2004 to 2008, data from Arizona's DPS shows a 23  percent drop in the overall crime rate, while the FBI's statistics on  Arizona show a 19 percent drop. Although the FBI has not released all  of the data on 2009, Arizona's statistics show the crime rate in 2009  dropped an additional 12 percent.
""Crime has been going  down, overall, in Arizona,"" said Tony LaRose, an associate professor of  criminology at the University of Tampa, but he noted it has been a national  trend for the past almost three decades.""
The trend holds even if  you only measure violent crime, which James Alan Fox, a professor of  criminology at Northeastern University, said is the type of crime  people think of when discussing crime and illegal immigrants. The  violent crime rate fell 11 percent from 2004 to 2008 in Arizona.
Whether  or not Hunt was correctly interpreting McCain's comments is outside of  the scope of the claim, but he is right about Arizona crime going  down.",1,Al Hunt
"""Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP."" Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is pushing a proposal to cap the sizes of large banks. He appeared on ABC News' This Week with Jake Tapper to talk about that, as well as Democratic efforts to pass financial reform.
""Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake,"" Brown said. ""Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. ... We've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.""
Some very smart people disagree on Brown's point that big banks resist regulation by reason of their sheer mass.
People like Simon Johnson , the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks. Meanwhile, people like Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize-winning New York Times columnist, say that breaking up the banks isn't necessary to avert the next meltdown if the proper regulations are put in place.
We were interested in Brown's statistic though: That 15 years ago the top six banks' assets totaled 17 percent of GDP, while today that's 63 percent.
Brown's staff said he got the numbers from 13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown , a book by Johnson and James Kwak, that describes the financial crisis and advocates steps for reform, including limits on the size of banks. Johnson also cited the number in an article in the New Republic, co-written with Peter Boone, that criticized President Barack Obama for not pushing rules that are tougher on big banks.
The numbers are a fairly straightforward calculation. You take the bank's total assets, such as loans, cash and securities. (Remember that to banks, a loan is an asset, since they make money off loans.) Then you divide by GDP, which is gross domestic product, and is the total economic output for a country during a given year. Last year, the U.S. gross domestic product was $14.3 trillion.
Johnson's book lists the six biggest banks of 2009 as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
The numbers in the book looked right to us, but we wanted to find an outside expert to confirm it. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia agreed to run the numbers to see if they got the same thing.
Sure enough, they found the same thing. The figures were off by a few percentage points because the researchers were able to use numbers from the fourth quarter of 2009 and compared them with the same quarter in 1994. Johnson's book cites numbers from the third quarter.
Here's the information the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia sent us:
Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 2009
Bank of America Corp. - 2,224.5
JP Morgan Chase - 2,032.0
Citigroup - 1,856.6
Wells Fargo - 1,243.6
Goldman Sachs - 849.3
Morgan Stanley - 771.5
Total 8,977.5
Nominal GDP 14.453.8
Percentage 62.1%
Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 1994
Citicorp - 250.5
BankAmerica Corp. - 215.5
Chemical Banking Corp. - 171.4
Nationsbank Corp. - 169.6
JP Morgan - 154.9
Chase Manhattan - 114.0
Total 1,075.9
Nominal GDP 7,248.2
Percentage 14.8%
A couple of experts we asked about these numbers noted that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were for years categorized as investment banks, and would not have been counted in the 1994 numbers. That changed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, when the two firms became bank holding companies so they could borrow from the Federal Reserve. The underlying point, though -- that there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry -- remains true, they said.
Brown said, ""Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP.",1,Sherrod Brown
"""We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families."" President Barack Obama talked a lot about economic recovery during his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, including the benefits of the economic stimulus bill passed last year.
The stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, included tax cuts for many Americans, Obama said.
""We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses,"" Obama said. ""We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.""
Democrats applauded, while Republicans were silent for the most part. In one of the unscripted moments of the night, Obama looked at the Republican side of the room, smiled and said, ""I thought I'd get some applause on that one.""
Here, we wanted to check Obama's statement that he cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.
The key word in his statement is ""working."" Obama's claim is based on a tax cut intended to offset payroll taxes. Under the stimulus bill, single workers got $400, and working couples got $800. The Internal Revenue Service issued new guidelines to reduce withholdings for income tax, so many workers saw a small increase in their checks in April 2009.
The tax cut was part of Obama's campaign promises. During the campaign, Obama said he wanted $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. Since the final number was a bit less than he promised, we rated his promise a Compromise on our Obameter, where we rate Obama's campaign promises for fulfillment.
During the campaign, the independent Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. It concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. According to the analysis, the people who wouldn't get a tax cut are those who make more than $250,000 for couples or $200,000 for a single person. Obama said he intended to raise taxes on those high earners, a promise he reiterated during the State of the Union, and that revenue would offset the stimulus tax cut.",1,Barack Obama
"""We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense."" In a June 30, 2010, Facebook post, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted excerpts from a speech she gave in Norfolk, Va., primarily on national security. At one point, she said, ""We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense.""
We thought we'd check her math. (We also checked another statement from the same post, that the U.S. ""only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP."" We gave that one a Barely True .
Let's preface this discussion by noting that federal budgeting involves extremely arcane categories and that various measures can be plausible yardsticks in analyzing this question.
The one we chose was the baseline projection included in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal. (That's Table S-3 for budget nerds.) The figure for fiscal year 2009 -- the last complete fiscal year -- shows the following breakdown:
• Appropriated security programs: $782 billion
• Mandatory programs (includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, among other programs): $2.112 trillion
• Net interest: $187 billion
If you add together mandatory programs and the net interest, then divide that by the amount spent on security programs, the ratio is 2.93 -- very close to the ""three times more"" that Palin cites.
Here are some caveats. The appropriated security programs category includes the nuclear weapons portion of the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. Defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total, but not the entire amount.
Meanwhile, if you total up the budget for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- the three big entitlements most familiar to Americans -- it accounts for about two-thirds of the budget for mandatory programs. The ""other mandatory programs"" category includes such things as veterans' benefits.
Despite these distinctions, we think it's reasonable for Palin to describe all security programs as ""defense"" and all mandatory programs as ""entitlements.",1,Sarah Palin
"""I haven't missed a vote since 1993."" Senators love to boast about their voting records, and Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is no exception.
During a weekly conference call with Iowa reporters, Grassley was asked about his re-election prospects this year.
""I'm going to have tough competition,"" he said of his three opponents. ""Even though there's suggestions at the national level that this could be a very Republican year, I can't assume that it's going to be a very Republican year. And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign.""
Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say ""aye"" or ""nay.""
First, we turned to   Congressional Quarterly  , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to   CQ  's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The   Washington Post  also compiles similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.)
What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the   Des Moines Register, noting that the senator has become ""the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes.""
Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time.
Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it.
""Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep,"" he Tweeted the night of the 18th. ""Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive.""
Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote. Grassley has every right to brag. We give him a True.",1,Chuck Grassley
"The national debt ""has gone up by $1,729,000,000 during the Isner v. Mahut match."" The mind-bogglingly long Wimbledon tennis match between John Isner of the United States and Nicolas Mahut of France finally ended on June 24, 2010, after 11 hours and 5 minutes. Isner prevailed 70-68 in the fifth set.
Leave it to Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla. -- who represents a Sarasota-area district not far from Isner's Tampa home -- to turn this sports oddity into a political point.
Not long after Isner finally won, Buchanan tweeted, ""Think Wimbledon tickets are expensive? Our National Debt has gone up by $1,729,000,000 during the Isner v. Mahut match.""
We couldn't resist checking his math.
We first decided that what Buchanan meant by ""during the Isner v. Mahut match"" was the time between the first serve on June 22, 2010, and the final point on June 24, 2010. That was roughly 48 hours, or two days.
One way to look at it is to use the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the president's budget, which was released in March. This predicts a $1.368 trillion deficit for 2010. If you divide this by 365 days, you get an incremental, daily addition to the debt of $3.748 billion. Over two days, the total is $7.496 billion. That's more than four times of Buchanan's estimate.
Another way is to turn to the historical tables for federal debt published by the Office of Management and Budget. These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec. 31. We took the debt estimate for the end of 2010 ($13.787 trillion) and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009 ($11.876 trillion) to determine the amount of debt increase over the course of 2010 ($1.911 trillion).
Dividing by 365, you get a daily debt increase of $5.234 billion, or $10.470 billion over two days. That's about six times more than what Buchanan had said.
Why so different? We contacted Buchanan's office and an aide clarified that what they'd actually meant in the tweet was how much the debt had risen during the 11-hour, 5-minute match itself. (The match was suspended for darkness twice and there were delays on the third day to give extra rest time.)
So, using our first method, the 11-hour debt increase works out to $1.718 billion, while using the second, it's about $2.4 billion. Of these two, the first is spot-on.
Since the size of the federal debt is a moving target, and since economists periodically re-evaluate its size, we'll grant Buchanan leeway here. While we think the wording of his tweet suggests the full, 48-hour period, his 11-hour number strikes us as a reasonable estimate.",1,Vern Buchanan
"""The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'"" President Barack Obama has proposed a boost for small businesses, but Sen. Judd Gregg isn't hot on the idea.
In a hearing about the administration's latest budget, Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, criticized the White House for proposing to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, an initiative originally intended to keep the banking system from collapsing, to help community banks lend to small businesses. Gregg said it violates TARP rules.
""The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money ... and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt,"" Gregg said, responding to Obama's Feb. 2, 2010, proposal to transfer $30 billion from TARP to a new program that will support small business lending. ""Now that's not going to happen. ... It's become a piggy bank. ... The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'""
Peter Orszag, Obama's budget chief, defended the proposal.
""The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity,"" he told Gregg. ""And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets ... and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses.""
Late in 2009, Obama ran into similar criticism from Republican lawmakers after he announced that he wanted to use unspent TARP money for tax breaks for small businesses and investments in infrastructure projects, among other things. Then, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said, ""To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law, and it would betray the trust of the American people."" We found Pence's claim to be Half True. On one hand, the TARP legislation is quite clear: Section 106, Part D of the TARP legislation: ""Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt.""
But we also talked with budget experts who said that Congress could get around those rules in a number of ways. For example, Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use it to pay other expenses, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation.
""Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants,"" Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, told us in December.
In Gregg's case, though, he's strictly talking about what the law says, that TARP money cannot be used for anything other than deficit reduction.",1,Judd Gregg
"""The lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less (on health care). ... To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner."" In his new book, No Apology, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney devotes a chapter to health care policy -- a topic that animated his tenure as governor of Massachusetts.
Romney, working with a Democratic-dominated legislature, passed a health care overhaul that was designed to get his state as close to universal coverage as possible. Romney is now often discussed as a presidential candidate for 2012, which has forced him into an uncomfortable balancing act: He seeks to lead a party intent on blocking President Barack Obama's health care proposal, even though he himself enacted a plan that, according to many sources we interviewed earlier this year , shares much in common with what Obama is proposing.
We looked through the health care chapter of Romney's book as well as transcripts of his recent media appearances, but we were unable to locate a clear, fact-checkable statement addressing the similarities and differences between the two bills. (He broached the issue on a number of occasions, but in each case he phrased his statements in such a way that made it difficult for us to subject them to the Truth-O-Meter.)
So while Romney did not compare the Massachusetts plan with Obama's proposal, in his book he compared the U.S. system with other nations'.
""The lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less"" on health care, Romney wrote, adding, ""To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner.""
The first place we looked was the statistical archive of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that represents 30 advanced, industrialized nations, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America. Scholars consider OECD figures to be among the most reliable for international comparisons on health care.
First, we'll look at life expectancy -- the number of years someone born in a certain year can expect to live. The OECD's most recent figures, for either 2005 or 2006 (the year varies by country), show that the United States ranks 24th -- well under the average level for the 30 nations studied.
Specifically, life expectancy in the United States was 77.8 years. That put it behind the following nations, in descending order: Japan (at 82.4 years in 2006), Switzerland, Iceland, Spain, Australia, Italy, France, Sweden, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Portugal and Denmark.
Meanwhile, health and population economists at the World Health Organization devised another measure to gauge life expectancy -- disability-adjusted life expectancy, or how many years one can expect to live before becoming disabled by old-age illnesses. WHO did its last full-blown international comparison of DALE, as it is abberviated, in 2000, and the results are much the same.
The United States ranked 24th on the WHO list with exactly 70 years of DALE. It trailed Japan (with 74.5), Australia, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Iceland, Finland, Malta, Germany and Israel.
Now, we'll look at health care expenditures. There are two ways to measure this -- by expenditures per capita, or by expenditures as a percentage of GDP. However you measure it, we're No. 1 -- by a mile.
Using the first measure, the OECD reports that the United States spent $7,290 on health care per capita in 2007. The only two other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded even $4,000 were Norway and Switzerland.
Using the second measure, the United States spent more than 15 percent of GDP on health care in 2006, according to the OECD. Only Switzerland and France exceeded 11 percent.
To take one extreme case, South Korea spends less than a quarter per capita of what the United States spends on health care -- yet its people, on average, live past 79 years of age, which is more than one full year longer than Americans do.
Ali Mokdad, a professor in global health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, attributes the United States' poor showing in part to a lack of emphasis on preventive care.
""We have fallen behind other countries in tackling the root causes of mortality and disease,"" Mokdad said. ""We know, for example, that just reducing salt in people’s diets can save more than 100,000 lives a year, but there is much more discussion in this country about health insurance, which would save, at best, about half as many people.""
Whatever the reason, and however you measure it, Americans ""spend more and die sooner,"" as Romney so bluntly put it.",1,Mitt Romney
"""There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts. Two are walking the street right now."" The current and former vice presidents -- Joe Biden and Dick Cheney -- battled it out on separate Sunday morning talk shows on Feb. 14, 2010, debating the Obama administration's policies on bringing accused terrorists to justice.
At times, their debate seemed more like a philosophical argument: Should terrorists be treated like vanquished military opponents or common criminals? If you believe the former, you would support trying the accused in front of military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. If you believe the latter, you would favor trying them in U.S. courts.
Biden offered a full-throated defense of Obama administration plans to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed in U.S. courts, even though the administration supports commissions for some cases.
One of Biden's arguments was that U.S. courts work better and result in tougher sentences.
""Let me put this in perspective,"" Biden said on Face the Nation. ""There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts. Two are walking the street right now. There have been over 300 tried in federal courts by the last administration and by us. They're all in jail now. None of them are out seeing the light of day.""
We're looking into Biden's assertion that more than 300 people have been tried in federal courts and will post our findings soon.
Here, we are examining Biden's assertion that three people were tried and convicted by the last administration in military commissions, and that two of three have been released.
After consulting news reports and military documents, we discovered that Biden was correct. We also checked with experts who both support and oppose military commissions for various reasons, and no one disputed Biden's numbers.
Before we summarize the three cases, we should point out a few things about military commissions, which Congress authorized in laws passed in 2006 and 2009. The commissions operate under rules that are more favorable to the government than the rules typically found in federal courts, and the jurors are all members of the military. But that doesn't mean prosecutors always get what they want. In some cases, juries refuse to convict, and a military judge can allow or exclude evidence.
Here are the details on the three cases:
• David Hicks of Australia was the first person convicted by a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006, according to the Department of Defense. A native Australian, Hicks was a convert to Islam who was in Afghanistan before Sept. 11, 2001, and was picked up by U.S. forces in December of that year. The government said he had trained in al-Qaida camps. Hicks' case gained prominence in Australia, with members of the public urging his release. In a plea deal, Hicks pleaded guilty in March 2007 to one charge of providing material support to terrorism, an offense with a maximum sentence of life in prison. The commission sentenced Hicks to seven years, though most of that was suspended in an agreement that sent Hicks back to Australia to serve out his sentence. Hicks left an Australian prison and returned home in December 2007. On his release, Hicks issued a statement saying he intended to honor a plea deal not to talk to the media for one year, though he did add, ""I would like to recognize the huge debt of gratitude that I owe the Australian public for getting me home."" Hicks married in 2009 and is reportedly writing a book.
• Salim Hamdan was Osama bin Laden's driver. Prosecutors argued he was a dangerous terrorist, while his defense attorneys said he was a low-level aide. The military commission's jury found him guilty of providing material support for terrorism in August 2008, but sentenced him to little more than time served. The Bush administration sent him back to Yemen in November 2008. Reuters reported that the Yemeni government released him from jail in January 2009. (Hamdan was the petitioner in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, the U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned initial Bush administration efforts at setting up military commissions.) In August, he was living with his wife and two daughters in Sana'a, Yemen.
• Ali Hamza al Bahlul made propaganda videos at the direction of Osama bin Laden. In November 2009, a military commission jury convicted him of 35 counts of conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and providing material support for terrorism. Not only did Bahlul not allow his attorneys to put on a defense, but he also told the jury he volunteered for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that bin Laden turned him down, according to press reports. The jury sentenced him to life in prison, and Bahlul remains in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.
To be fair, we asked a supporter of military commissions about Biden's point, that there haven't been many convictions through military tribunals. Andrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a national security commentator for the conservative National Review, said that the commissions have been constantly challenged by liberal attorneys, which has hampered their progress.
""It is more than a little rich for the very people who moved heaven and earth to prevent the commissions from being completed now complain that we didn't complete very many commissions,"" McCarthy said.
In the interview on Face the Nation, Biden said he believed traditional federal courts would provide the longest sentences to terrorists, based on their track record of convictions. Of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, Biden said, ""Looking at the evidence that's been made available to me as part of, in a generic sense, the executive branch and the prosecuting team, I am absolutely convinced he will be put away for a long, long time.""
The debate on military commissions versus federal courts will no doubt continue. Here, we're checking Biden's statement that three people had been tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts, and that two are ""walking the street right now.",1,Joe Biden
"""The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era."" On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years.
Hoyer said that ""the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06,"" while Boehner claimed ""the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.""
With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Boehner said; in a separate item, we'll look at Hoyer's comment.
First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it.
The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.
That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans.
According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force.
However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said.
Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure.
Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years: 1998, 2004 and 2006.
So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution, even though on three occasions, it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final, identical version, and once the Senate, under Democratic control, had no budget resolution. We'll note that caveat, but we don't think his failure to mention that point undermines the accuracy of his statement.",1,John Boehner
"""President Obama's proposed 'spending freeze' will only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one-half of 1 percent."" In his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled a proposal to freeze discretionary spending for three years to help dig the country out of a ""massive fiscal hole.""
But Obama included some caveats. He said the freeze would exclude spending on national security as well as entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the freeze won't take effect until next year, ""when the economy is stronger,"" he said.
""Understand,"" Obama said, ""if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.""
That kind of belt-tightening talk makes for good sound bites, Republican leaders said afterward, but the freeze described by Obama, while a small step in the right direction, amounts to a tiny sliver of the country's massive (and growing) debt.
""President Obama's proposed 'spending freeze' will only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one-half of 1 percent,"" House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a live blog during Obama's speech.
But first, are Boehner's numbers themselves accurate?
A report released this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the federal government will spend $42.9 trillion over the next 10 years. The Obama administration itself says the freeze on nondefense discretionary spending would save $250 billion over 10 years. That number, however, is a bit more speculative than the CBO's overall estimate.
Speaking before the Senate Budget Committee on Jan. 28, 2010, Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said his office did not have enough details from the White House about which categories of spending would be exempt from Obama's pledge. Those details will be revealed when the White House presents its proposed 2011 budget next week. But Elmendorf said perhaps the most crucial factor in determining the long-term effect of the freeze is what happens in the years after the freeze. If spending immediately goes back to the levels they would have been at had they been rising all along, ""then the savings are just in those three years, and they're small,"" Elmendorf said.
For example, Elmendorf said, a freeze on all discretionary appropriations would only save about $10 billion in fiscal year 2011.
But, he said, if you essentially reset spending levels and only increase at the rate of inflation after the freeze, ""then you can achieve significant savings over the remaining years."" That's the route White House officials have said they want to go.
So that $250 billion figure cited by the White House seems in line with other estimates.
And by that measure, Boehner's attempt to put Obama's proposal into context is accurate. A freeze that would cut spending by $250 billion over 10 years amounts to a little more than one half of 1 percent of all government spending over that same period.
But he also relied on math that made Obama's freeze look especially tiny because the other number he cited -- $42 trillion in overall spending -- includes mandatory entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well as discretionary nondefense and defense programs. If you remove those items, Obama's freeze accounts for a slightly larger share -- about 4 percent over 10 years.
The White House, however, puts a more optimistic spin on this statistic saying that by the middle of the decade, nonsecurity discretionary spending would reach its lowest percentage of gross domestic product in 50 years.
Still the big-picture point made by Boehner and other Republicans is that Obama's proposed three-year spending freeze, which would apply only to about 17 percent of overall spending, does little to address the ""massive fiscal hole"" he described.
""In sum, the outlook for the federal budget is bleak,"" Elmendorf said.
So how much of a dent would Obama's freeze make?
""As a share of the total deficit problem, it is a small step,"" Elmendorf said.
So Obama positioned the spending freeze as a way to rein in the country's mounting debt, and we think it's fair for Boehner to put those spending cuts in the context of overall spending.",1,John Boehner
"The Republican Party ""fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed, as well as the voting rights bill."" When Rand Paul of Kentucky followed up his victory in the May 18, 2010, Republican U.S. Senate primary by saying that he had some reservations about the philosophical underpinnings of the Civil Rights Act, it prompted criticism from across the ideological spectrum.
""I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains,"" Paul said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. ""I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership. There's 10 different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that.""
Paul eventually retracted his comments, but they nonetheless sparked a media frenzy.
On ABC's This Week, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele -- his party's first African-American chairman -- made a point of arguing that his party had been on the forefront of civil rights when the landmark act Rand was referring to was passed in 1964, as well as the Voting Rights Act that passed the following year.
""Our party has always had a strong view on this issue,"" Steele told ABC's Jake Tapper. ""We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill.""
We decided to see whether Steele was correct.
The Civil Rights Act -- which is best known for barring discrimination in public accommodations -- passed the House on Feb. 10, 1964 by a margin of 290-130. When broken down by party, 61 percent of Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill (152 yeas and 96 nays), and a full 80 percent of the Republican caucus supported it (138 yeas and 34 nays).
When the Senate passed the measure on June 19, 1964, -- nine days after supporters mustered enough votes to end the longest filibuster in Senate history -- the margin was 73-27. Better than two-thirds of Senate Democrats supported the measure on final passage (46 yeas, 21 nays), but an even stronger 82 percent of Republicans supported it (27 yeas, 6 nays).
The primary reason that Republican support was higher than Democratic support -- even though the legislation was pushed hard by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson -- is that the opposition to the bill primarily came from Southern lawmakers. In the mid 1960s, the South was overwhelmingly Democratic -- a legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction, when the Republican Party was the leading force against slavery and its legacy. Because of this history, the Democratic Party in the 1960s was divided between Southern Democrats, most of whom opposed civil rights legislation, and Democrats from outside the South who more often than not supported it.
This pattern showed clearly in the House vote. Northern Democrats backed the Civil Rights Act by a margin even larger than that of Republicans -- 141 for, just four against -- while Southern Democrats were strongly opposed, by a margin of 11 yeas to 92 nays.
When the Voting Rights Act hit the floor in 1965, the vote results mirrored those of the Civil Rights Act. In the House, the measure passed by a 333-85 margin, with 78 percent of Democrats backing it (221 yeas and 61 nays) and 82 percent of Republicans backing it (112 yeas to 24 nays).
In the Senate, the measure passed by a 77-19 vote, with 73 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans supporting the bill.
So it's clear that Republican support for both bills was deep. But to make sure we weren't missing something, we contacted a number of scholars who have studied that period, asking whether Republicans were dragged into supporting the bills reluctantly, or whether they took frontline roles in advancing them.
Generally speaking, the scholars we talked to agreed that Republicans were important players, usually working cooperatively with Johnson and other leading Democrats.
Democrats deserve credit for being the driving force behind the legislation, our experts said, particularly Johnson, who had only been in office for three months yet who staked his own re-election prospects on a tough, divisive legislative battle. Other crucial Democratic players were Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who had been championing the issue of civil rights for a decade and a half.
But Republicans took leading positions as well, including Rep. Charles (Mac) Mathias of Maryland and Sen. Jacob Javits of New York. And during the 1950s, a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, had supported a civil rights legislation, though he never signed anything as sweeping as either the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act.
In the strategic challenge of getting the Civil Rights Act passed, Democrats knew that they would need to reach out to Republicans in order to overcome their own party's splits on the issue -- especially in the Senate, where a determined minority of one-third of the chamber could block consideration of a bill. (Today that number is two-fifths.)
The key to Senate passage of the Civil Rights Act was winning the support of Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., our experts said. By various accounts, Dirksen had some reservations with certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act, but Mansfield and Humphrey ""worked very closely"" with him, and ""key parts of the bill were worked out in Dirksen’s office in the evenings,"" said U.S. Senate Historian Donald A. Ritchie. Other midwestern Republicans followed Dirksen's lead and supported the bill. Once the filibuster was broken, Time magazine put Dirksen on its cover .
""You can gauge Everett Dirksen and the Republicans in various ways, but you have to give them real credit,"" said University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis, who called Dirksen ""a tough, veteran politician, and a pragmatist of the first order.""
To be sure, Republican support was not unanimous. Most notably, the party's 1964 presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, voted against the Civil Rights Act and stuck to that position during the campaign (which he lost to Johnson in a landslide). And Yale University political scientist David Mayhew notes that the large Republican vote totals for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were not replicated in other key civil rights battles, such as an earlier one relating to fair employment practices in 1949 and 1950 and a subsequent one on fair housing in 1966.
But on the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, the most notable factor affecting how Republicans voted was pragmatism, said Bert Rockman, a political scientist at Purdue University. ""The Republicans of that era deserve credit, lots of it, but less in a partisan way than in a now long-lost art form – forging a consensus around critical national problems.""
Back to Steele's quote: ""We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill.""
The degree of Republican support for the two bills actually exceeded the degree of Democratic support, and it's also fair to say that Republicans took leading roles in both measures, even though they had far fewer seats, and thus less power, at the time. Both of these factors are enough to earn Steele a rating of True.",1,Michael Steele
"""PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress."" Quick quiz of your online fluency: Do you know what PWNED means?
We'll admit we had to  Google it. In Internet geek, it's trash talk that means you ""owned"" your  opponent.
Here it is  in a recent press release from House Republican Leader John Boehner: ""PWNED:  House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress.""
The release said, ""The  conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate  an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the Internet’s most  popular communities. Once considered the party of online innovation, new  research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring  some of the most popular social media communities on the Web.""
Indeed, there's been a  widespread perception that Democrats had the lead. During the presidential  campaign, the Washington Post dubbed Barack Obama ""the king of social  networking."" By nearly every social networking measure -- Facebook, MySpace,  YouTube and Twitter -- Obama's engagement and influence dwarfed the McCain  campaign. Obama's text messaging became a powerful grass-roots tool for getting  out his message and raising money. The Obama campaign even mocked Sen. John  McCain for his inability to navigate the Internet and ran an ad linking him to a  record player and a Rubik's Cube.
We decided to fact-check Boehner's boast about  Republican domination of social media in Congress.
First stop:  Twitter.
Earlier  this month, Mark Senak, senior vice president and partner at Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm  in Washington, D.C., issued a report titled ""Twongress: The Power of Twitter in  Congress"" in which he analyzed the Twitter use of all members of Congress. The  findings surprised him.
In Congress, he found, there are 132 members using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats. It breaks down like  this: In the Senate, there are 14 Republicans using Twitter compared to 11  Democrats; and in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13  percent of the Republican caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the  Democratic caucus).
And the GOP leads in tweet production: ""Republicans  send out more tweets and have the attention of many more people than do the  Democrats,"" the report says.
The disparity in Twitter usage was most pronounced in  the House. In the House, only one Democrat ranks in the top 10 in terms of the  number of followers; and only two are in the top 20. Not only do more House  Republicans actively use Twitter, they have many more followers and send out far  more Twitter messages, 29,162 tweets compared to 5,503 for their Democratic  counterparts, according to the report, which tallied their messages through the  end of 2009.
The  power of Twitter, however, is not just in the number of followers you have and  how many messages you send out a day. The idea is to get people on your  followers list to ""re-tweet"" -- pass on -- your message, potentially exposing  your message to an exponentially larger group. So analysts also look at your  ""influence"" and ""clout,"" which factors in how often people ""re-tweet"" and cite  your messages. And by that measure, House Republicans are far outpacing  Democrats.
Measured  by the sheer number of followers, Boehner leads the Republicans in the House  with 18,800; followed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., with 16,500. But it  was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who led House Republicans in ""clout"" and  ""influence"" because she is re-tweeted so often.
And for the record,  the supposedly out-of-touch McCain beats everyone in Congress for total  followers, with nearly 1.6 million.
""When I first saw the results, I was surprised,""  Senak told PolitiFact. ""That was a counterintuitive finding after the Obama  campaign. But when when I thought about it, the party that is not in power  always has had to be more aggressive in using communication tools to get their  message.""
So Round  1, Twitter, to House Republicans.
What about YouTube?
On Jan. 21, 2010,  YouTube's CitizenTube posted a year-end wrap-up that showed 89 percent of  Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats in Congress have started YouTube  channels to engage their constituents. More importantly, people are watching the  Republican channels much more often. According to the report, eight of the top  10 most-viewed and most-subscribed YouTube channels in Congress are from the  GOP, though Democrats took two of the top three spots. The top 4, in order, are  Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,  D-Calif., and Boehner.
A tracking of YouTube views by industry analyst TubeMogul shows that with few exceptions, Republican videos consistently drew more clicks than those from Democrats. None of the videos have gone viral, said David Burch of TubeMogul, and no one is getting huge viewership. ""Obama spoiled us in terms of what 'a lot' means,"" during the campaign, he said. Obama remains on the cutting edge. On Jan. 25, 2010, the administration rolled out a new White House iPhone app which will allow users to watch White House live-streaming video.
Still, in Congress, the GOP is ahead. Round 2, YouTube, to Republicans.
And lastly, Facebook, the favorite of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Palin's Facebook page has more than 1.2 million fans.
No one in the House has that kind of reach. And we couldn't find any comprehensive analysis of engagement on FaceBook by members of Congress. But as of Jan. 22, 2010, Boehner had 31,757 fans of his page, compared to 8,745 for Pelosi.
Boehner's director of new media, Nick Schaper, said House Republicans are building an important lead in social media. ""We're pretty proud of that,"" he said.
For many Republicans, the Obama campaign was a real eye-opener to the power of social media tools. And so Republican leaders made a conscious effort to ramp up their involvement. In weekly meetings, members of the Republican conference routinely discuss their social media successes and talk about how best to use various tools.
Engagement in new social media just makes sense, Schaper said. It's easy to use, but it takes commitment.
Boehner typically tweets about 5 to 10 times a day.
""The more active you are, the more followers you get,"" Schaper explained. ""Everyone on the press team considers Twitter an important part of the process. We make it a focus, not a secondary kind of thing.""
It's a great resource to reach people with your message, he said. Boehner might only have about 19,000 followers on Twitter, but if enough people re-tweet some of his messages, he can reach a couple hundred thousand people in just a couple hours.
But while House Republicans may rightly crow about deeper engagement in social media than their Democratic counterparts, Senak, the author of the study, says neither side is doing particularly well compared to other large institutions. Both parties have a minority of members engaged in Twitter. And neither side has fully embraced the give-and-take of Twitter. Most members have elected to follow very few other people and rarely ""re-tweet."" In other words, he said, they are mostly using Twitter as a soapbox.
""Both sides have room for a tremendous amount of improvement,"" Senak said.
But the bottom line is that Boehner is correct when he boasts that the House GOP dominates the Democrats on Twitter, YouTube and other social media in Congress.
Still, we had to ask, is Boehner really so plugged-in that he knows what PWNED means?
Schaper artfully sidestepped the question and said, ""He surprises me every time I talk about it (social media). I think people would be surprised.""
On this claim, Boehner earns a True.",1,John Boehner
"Democrats have said that ""even one hearing (on the stimulus bill) would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions."" When Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, complained this week that Democrats were ramming the proposed $835 billion economic stimulus package too quickly through Congress, he was hardly charting new territory as far as minority party gripes.
The ""you're not giving us reasonable time to debate this important legislation"" is a well-worn minority party refrain.
But we wondered whether Barton was accurate when he said the House Energy and Commerce Committee has not — and will not — hold a single hearing on a major portion of the $850 billion stimulus plan that came before it.
Here's what Barton said on Jan. 22: ""While I understand the majority’s desire to move quickly on the stimulus package, I think the short leash that the speaker has put us on restricts our ability to write competent legislation. We have not had a single hearing on anything in front of us, meaning that the only opinion we’ve heard on the expenditure of billions of dollars is that of the speaker. We’ve been told that even one hearing would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions. That’s because the speaker wants the entire stimulus package on the House floor next week.
“By my count, in front of us are 269 pages of text. I have not yet seen the most recent CBO score, but suffice it to say that these 269 pages approve the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars. Will this package of legislation waste money? Will it abuse people? Will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences? Will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today? The answer is yes, yes, yes and yes.""
The portion of the stimulus plan that came before Energy and Commerce Committee includes about $170 billion in proposed spending.
No one challenges the claim that the massive spending bill is being fast-tracked.
At a congressional forum on Jan. 7, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained the urgency this way: ""Nothing could be clearer than the fact that we need action and we need action now. A failure to act quickly can only lead to more job losses and more economic pain for Americans. If we act boldly and rapidly, we can begin to create new jobs and opportunities today and strengthen our economy, as you said, for the long run.""
President Obama has said he wants to have the package approved by mid February.
Republicans have cried foul, saying there has been little effort by Democrats to craft a bipartisan package, and that they only received a draft of the proposal on Jan. 16. Less than a week later, the plan came before the House Appropriations, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees,  for one day of ""markups."" That means committee members can propose amendments.
On Jan. 22, Barton's Energy and Commerce Committee, on which he is the senior Republican, held a marathon 12-hour ""markup"" session during which numerous amendments were added to the proposal. The fate of amendments largely depended on which side of the aisle the suggestions came from, as nearly all of the dozens of Republican-backed amendments were rejected.
Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office, said while congressional committees are typically permitted hearings on major spending plans, ""when there's an emergency, they tend not to go along in regular order. ... When the leadership of both houses agrees it's important enough to circumvent, then they'll go around the regular order.""
The minority party almost always objects, he said, but both parties have done it when they control the majority.
""It's not unprecedented by any means,"" Ritchie said of bypassing hearings. But it is unusual for such a large spending plan.
""There hasn't been anything of that magnitude in a long time,"" Ritchie said. ""That stands out by itself, I think.""
Barton used words like ""abomination"" and ""truly an insult"" to describe the fast-tracking of the plan.
By way of explaining the need for a streamlined review, Committee Chairman Rep. Henry A. Waxman said, ""We are in a deep and long recession. Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent and growing. We urgently need an economic recovery package — and we need it immediately.""
On Jan. 23, Obama met with Republican leadership to get their input on the proposed stimulus package; and he agreed to meet with the Republican caucuses this week, though many Republicans scoffed at the suggestion it will result in anything close to a bipartisan plan.
One can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings, but Barton is right: There have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that Congress is expected to vote on as early as this week.
We rule his statement True.",1,Joe Barton
"""Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."" In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, newly elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said his state had the chance to be the first on the Atlantic coast to drill offshore for oil and natural gas.
""Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills,"" McDonnell said Jan. 27, 2010, from the floor of Virginia's House of Delegates. ""Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore.""
If drilling happens in the Atlantic, is Virginia first in line?
Drilling in the Atlantic -- like in the eastern Gulf of Mexico -- has been taboo until recently. The Minerals Management Service, an arm of the U.S. Department of the Interior, has not held a lease sale for oil or natural gas drilling in the Atlantic since 1983. No leases remain active.
The MMS, however, included 2.9 million acres off the shores of Virginia as part of its 2007-2012 gas and oil leasing program. But exploration was prohibited by both executive order and a congressional moratorium.
That changed in the summer of 2008. President George W. Bush lifted the executive order banning drilling, then Congress allowed the moratorium to expire.
In November of that year, the MMS initiated what it called a ""multiyear"" leasing process for the rights to drill off Virginia's coast. The area potentially open to drilling would start 50 miles offshore and sits north of the opening of the Chesapeake Bay, closest to Virginia's Eastern Shore counties on the Delmarva Peninsula. The MMS says the area may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It's the only area in the Atlantic under consideration.
Why is McDonnell bringing this up?
He believes the Obama administration has done little to move the lease sale ahead. The MMS says it won't happen before 2011.
In a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Dec. 23, 2009, McDonnell pressed for prompt action, saying drilling could create 2,578 new jobs over 10 years and $271 million in state and local taxes. Those figures, which McDonnell says were based on a 2005 report by the former president of Old Dominion University, subsequently have been questioned . But that's not what we're checking.
McDonnell said Virginia was ready to ""be the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."" Indeed, the nearly 3 million acres off the coast of Virginia is the only area in the Atlantic in the federal government's current five-year oil and gas leasing program. It also is the only area currently in the leasing process. It puts Virginia at the head of the class. And it makes McDonnell right.",1,Bob McDonnell
"The health care bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year. In the many months of debate over health care reform, we don't recall hearing much about how low your income will have to be to qualify for federal health insurance subsidies. But on March 21, 2010, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- who, like all congressional Republicans, voted against the Senate version of the Democratic health care bill -- tackled the issue directly.
""Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?"" Hatch said in an interview on CNN's State of the Union.
That struck us as high, so we decided to see if Hatch was right.
First, a word about how the subsidies work in the bill, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The subsidies will take effect in 2014 and are available to Americans who buy insurance on exchanges, which will be virtual marketplaces for health plans. The exchanges are designed to serve people who do not already have insurance through their employer and who are not covered by a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
The bill offers two kinds of subsidies to people who buy through the exchange -- one for insurance premiums and one for out-of-pocket medical costs.
Under the premium subsidy, the government will pay the difference between the premiums for a designated plan and a set percentage of your income. As for the cost-sharing subsidy, the mechanism is still evolving, but the idea is to reduce the amount that beneficiaries have to shell out for co-pays and other medical expenses.
The subsidies will operate on a sliding scale, benefiting those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. At the upper end of the range of those who qualify for premium subsidies -- those earning 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty level -- the government will pay whatever amount of the premium that exceeds 9.5 percent of the beneficiary's income. (Those earning less than 133 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid.)
Officially, the federal poverty limit for a family of four is $22,050, and 400 percent of that amount would be $88,200. We checked with several health care experts and they confirmed that that would indeed be the top income at which someone could receive subsidies.
That means that many people earning the subsidies will actually earn more than the median income for married couple familes -- $73,010.
On the other hand, how big $88,200 is depends on where you live. In four states, $88,200 is actually below the median income for a family of four -- in New Jersey ($94,441), Maryland ($94,017), Connecticut ($93,821) and Massachusetts ($89,347). In each of these states, the cost of living is quite a bit higher than the national average, and in many cases these states have health insurance mandates that boost premiums above the national average. By contrast, $88,200 is well above the median income in Arkansas ($52,185), Mississippi ($52,992) and Hatch's state of Utah ($63,586). The bill does not include any mechanism to even out such geographic variations.
Another point: Families making $88,200, wherever they are, will have to spend significantly before they see any federal subsidy kick in. The maximum someone would have to pay for health insurance premiums before subsidies kick in is $8,379 (or 9.5 percent times $88,200). For most people, that's a hefty premium. On average, a worker's share of health care premiums at smaller companies (three to 199 employees) that use an HMO for full-family coverage amounted to $5,039 in 2009, according to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.
Still, premiums north of $8,000 are conceivable. Costs would be higher for those seeking insurance on the individual market (if coverage can be found), and the price would likely be higher in more expensive states. In the meantime, premiums could be especially steep for older Americans who are not yet 65 -- the age they can enroll in Medicare.
""Those aged 64 can be charged up to three times as much as an 18-year-old for the same coverage,"" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""So families that include older adults could face very high premiums relative to their incomes, even at 400 percent of the poverty level, making it unaffordable for such families to purchase coverage without a subsidy.""
All of this helps explain the rationale for why a family earning $88,200 might need federal assistance. But it doesn't undermine the validity of Hatch's point. Starting in 2014, the health care bill will indeed ""subsidize ... families of four that make over $80,000 a year.",1,Orrin Hatch
"Democratic presidents ""have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs."" As the recession continues to inflict economic pain on most Americans, the political battle to frame the debate rages on. In a House floor speech on Jan. 21, 2010, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., held up a chart showing job creation statistics under two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
""This chart goes back to 1992, the year that President [Bill] Clinton was elected,"" Maloney said. ""It shows that during his time there was very robust job creation in the private sector, and then during the Bush years it fell dramatically. This dark line is the job creation, going up during the Clinton years, falling dramatically under the [George W.] Bush administration. It also shows that Democrats have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs.""
We wondered whether that pattern held true for other presidents as well, or whether Maloney had simply chosen two presidencies that conveniently showed her party in the most favorable light. So we ran the numbers and got some interesting results.
We did this by turning to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site, where visitors can customize data tables on national employment statistics. We used the month-by-month totals for nonfarm employment in the United States. (We actually ran the numbers twice -- once using Maloney's cited statistic, private-sector employment, and a second time using the combination of private-sector and government employment. It turned out that the general trends were virtually identical, so we'll be sticking with the statistics on just private-sector employment below.)
The BLS data go back to 1939, but since that fell in the middle of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, we skipped forward to Harry Truman and compared him and all of his post-World War II successors.
We also did some minor massaging of the numbers in order to make the statistics more comparable.
First, we calculated how much the number of jobs rose or fell on each president's watch. Then we divided that result by the number of jobs there were when the president began his first term, in order to get a percentage increase in jobs over that president's tenure. This enabled us to minimize the effect of population growth, which would otherwise credit later presidents with larger employment increases than earlier ones.
Next, we divided this job growth percentage by the number of years the president occupied the Oval Office, creating a statistic that calculates percentage job growth per year as president. This allowed us to more fairly compare the job growth rates under, say, Gerald Ford with those of two-termers such as Ronald Reagan and Clinton.
Finally, we lumped the Democratic presidents' annual job-growth percentages together and averaged them, and did the same for the Republicans. Because President Barack Obama has served just one year in office -- a length of time that some would consider statistically problematic -- we ran the Democratic numbers both with and without Obama, so that readers could choose their preferred statistic.
Before we provide the final totals, let's run down how each president did. Here are the average annual percentage increases in jobs for each postwar president:
Harry S. Truman (Democrat): increase of 2.95 percent a year
Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican): increase of 0.50 percent a year
John F. Kennedy (Democrat): increase of 2.03 percent a year
Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat): increase of 3.88 percent a year
Richard M. Nixon (Republican): increase of 2.16 percent a year
Gerald R. Ford (Republican): increase of 0.86 percent a year
Jimmy Carter (Democrat): increase of 3.45 percent a year
Ronald Reagan (Republican): increase of 2.46 percent a year
George H.W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.40 percent a year
Bill Clinton (Democrat): increase of 2.86 percent a year
George W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.01 percent a year
Barack Obama (Democrat): decrease of 3.0 percent a year
(Can we take time out here to say how surprised we are that Eisenhower, who presided over the ""happy"" 1950s, managed an anemic half-percent job growth per year, while Jimmy ""Malaise"" Carter finished second with 3.45 percent annual job growth?)
Now for the totals. If you exclude Obama, Democrats averaged 3.03 percent annual job growth, compared to 1.07 percent for Republicans -- a nearly 3-to-1 advantage.
If you include Obama, the Democrats still held a significant edge. With Obama included, the Democrats averaged 2.03 annual job growth, compared to the same 1.07 for Republicans -- about twice as high as the GOP.
And based on some quick calculations he did, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, making the Democratic accomplishment even more impressive.
So the statistics are clear: Democratic presidents have been more successful at creating jobs. But how much importance should we assign to this fact? We hereby list some caveats that we and several historians we contacted came up with.
-- The president actually deserves less credit for the good times -- and less blame for the bad times. It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes.
-- Timing can be hugely important. ""Statistics about employment growth over presidential terms are dominated by the timing of the business cycle, including Federal Reserve policy, and have no apparent connection to economic policies attributed to the White House, as opposed to Congress,"" said Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. One example: Clinton had the good fortune to enter office when the economy had just undergone a recession. This relatively low starting point made it easier for him to rack up big gains over eight years. The converse is true for George W. Bush: He took office right as the tech bubble was bursting, meaning that any jobs he added to the nation's total amounted to digging the country out of a jobs hole.
-- Outside factors can play a big role. Truman's private-sector employment numbers likely benefited from the post-World War II demobilization of troops. (Private sector jobs grew at 2.95 percent per year during his presidency, compared to 2.7 percent a year for all jobs.) Meanwhile, Lyndon Johnson took office right as the first wave of baby boomers was turning 18, a fact that almost certainly boosted his job-creation figures. And research by James D. Hamilton, an economist at the University of California at San Diego has shown that oil price shocks -- something entirely out of a president's control -- have caused most postwar recessions.
As Yale political scientist David Mayhew points out, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, most experts we spoke to agreed that the pattern is too consistent to dismiss out of hand.
And it's not the only one that reflects a strong correlation between an economic factor and the president's partisan affiliation. In his 2008 book Unequal Democracy, Princeton University political scientist Larry Bartels showed that changes in income inequality are strongly correlated with the president's party. Under every postwar Republican president, Bartels concluded, the gap between rich and poor has grown, and under every Democratic president except for Carter, that gap has shrunk. (For those on the lookout for ideological bias, Bartels made a point of writing in his introduction that he is ""an unusually apolitical political scientist"" who last voted in 1984, for Reagan. ""I was quite surprised to discover how often and how profoundly partisan differences in ideologies and values have shaped key policy decisions and economic outcomes,"" he wrote. ""I have done my best to follow my evidence where it led me."")
Ultimately, the experts we contacted said that, despite the caveats, Maloney's calculations, and our expansion of them, were justified.
""This is a reasonable exercise in the scheme of things,"" said liberal economist Dean Baker. ""Obviously, luck matters a lot, but when there is a consistent pattern over more than 60 years, it starts to look like more than just luck.""
Kevin Hassett, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former economic adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, argued that the best way to evaluate presidents is to look at their policies. Still, he added, calculations like Maloney's ""are worth doing. They can be thought-provoking and can ignite debates that help inform.""",1,Carolyn Maloney
"""Tommy Thompson created the first school choice program in the nation, giving thousands of Milwaukee students the choice of where they go to school – no matter where they live or how much money their parents make."" The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program was established in 1989, it was the first of its kind. The program allowed low income families to use state funds to send their children, at no cost to them, to the public or private school of their choice.
David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institution, gives Thompson and a Milwaukee state legislator, Polly Williams, ""most of the credit"" for creating school choice.  ""The (Milwaukee) school choice reform was pivotal in putting choice on the national agenda.""
In an editorial praising Thompson as ""America's No. 1 public-policy tinkerer,"" the Capital Times declared that after welfare reform, ""If there is a second ""reform"" for which Thompson is credited, it is state support of the development of school vouchers.""",1,Tommy Thompson
"""You know we can't just pull out now... The truth of the matter is: If we started today, it would take one year, one year to get 160,000 troops physically out of Iraq, logistically."" U.S. commanders say it would be a lengthy process, and independent military analysts have said it would take about a year to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq safely. It could be done faster, but with larger U.S. casualties and more abandoned equipment, experts say. McClatchy Newspapers has reported that a simulation conducted by the Pentagon since the debate suggested a retreat could take as little as six months, but critics said that estimate is overly optimistic.
""We must consider the complexity of the threat and deliberately reduce our forces based on the situation on the ground as well as the capability of the Iraqi security forces,"" Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, the deputy commander of forces in Iraq, said at a briefing this month. ""I think the plan will reflect that as we develop it.""",1,Joe Biden
"In the stimulus, ""$15 million dollars  went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska,  population 165."" In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent.
""I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money,"" Obama said. ""And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked.""
On the same day Obama made his speech, House Republican Leader John Boehner issued a press release saying the stimulus is ""chock-full of wasteful government spending."" And he attached a list of 19 ""real world"" examples.
We looked at several of the items on this list to see if they were as billed. Here, we will examine the claim that ""$15 million (in stimulus) dollars  went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska,  population 165.""
This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a CBS Evening News report on July 13, 2009. ""That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident,"" the report said.
""Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights,"" the CBS report states. ""And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway.""
A lengthier story three days later in the Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq.
Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus: ""The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States — home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights.""
Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the Kodiak Daily Mirror, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road.
""I’m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services,"" Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the Kodiak Daily Mirror. ""They are essential, whether you’re talking about five people or 5,000.""
Quick also said planes  have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were  transported via skiff.
""I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out,"" added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. ""I feel it's for the safety of our community.""
In an opinion piece for the Anchorage Press, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report ""sensationalizing"" and told people to ""quit picking on Ouzinkie.""
Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, ""The point is that we should think carefully about what’s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie’s lifeline will continue to be someone else’s taxpayer waste.""
On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.",1,John Boehner
"To give the proposed economic stimulus plan some perspective, ""if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion."" In a CBS   Face the Nation  interview on Feb. 1, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky, sought to put the proposed economic stimulus bill into some sobering perspective.
""You know, this is huge money,"" McConnell said. ""This is — someone said the other day that, if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion.”
The bill isn't that expensive yet — the House version is estimated at $819 billion — but the Senate is expected to add new programs and additional tax cuts that could increase the cost significantly. Both chambers are expected to keep the total pricetag under $1 trillion.
We'll save you from counting zeros on your online calculator and give you our quick and dirty assessment of whether his analogy is right.
First, a starting point. Biblical scholars may quibble about the actual birth date of Jesus Christ, but we're going to go with the fairly commonly accepted theory that it was around 4 B.C. That's right, it would mean Christ was actually born ""Before Christ.""
Add that to Anno Domini time, and you come to 2012 years since the birth of Christ.
So here goes our math: 2,012 times 365 (yes, we are aware there are leap years ... don't be like that) times $1,000,000. A: $734 billion (give or take a few hundred million).
The stimulus package is actually short of $1 trillion too, $819 billion. But that's still more than a million bucks a day since the day Jesus was born.",1,Mitch McConnell
"""We passed without, frankly, the help of the Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses."" With the recent Massachusetts Senate election redefining the political landscape  in Washington, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory asked David Axelrod, a  senior adviser to President Barack Obama, whether the president now needs to  start moving more toward the middle.
Axelrod responded that Republicans and Democrats ought  to be working together on ways to stimulate job growth, but he said Republicans  have not gotten on board even when it comes to tax cuts that Republicans have  traditionally supported.
""We passed without, frankly, the help of the  Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle  class and small businesses,"" Axelrod said.
We were intrigued by the claim that Democrats passed  25 tax cuts last year, so we contacted the White House press office and asked  for a list. And they gave us one, all from the economic stimulus package  championed by Obama and signed on Feb. 17, 2009.
We checked them out,  provided sections and page numbers in the stimulus for reference, and added a  brief explainer for some. If your eyes glaze over midway through, feel free to  skip ahead to the bottom of the list where we'll pick up our analysis.
Individual Tax  Cuts:
1. ""Making  Work Pay"" Tax Credit (Sec. 1001, Page 195). In tax years 2009 and 2010, the  Making Work Pay provision will provide a refundable tax credit of 6.2 percent of  earned income up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers  filing joint returns.
2. Increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (Sec.  1002, Page 198). Go to the stimulus bill for all the details, but it essentially  expands this benefit for the working poor.
3. Increased Eligibility for the Refundable Portion  of Child Credit (Sec. 1003, Page 199). In 2009 and 2010, families who don’t earn  enough to pay income tax would be eligible to claim the $1,000 child credit.
4. ""American  Opportunity"" Education Tax Credit (Sec. 1004, Page 199). Increases the Hope  Scholarship Credit to $2,500.
5. Refundable First-time Home Buyer Credit. (Sec.  1006, Page 202). This extended and increased the first-time home buyer tax  credit from $7,500 to $8,000.
6. Temporary Suspension of Taxation of Unemployment  Benefits (Sec. 1007, Page 203). This exempts from taxable gross income the first  $2,400 of unemployment benefits.
7. Tax Credits for Energy-Efficient Improvements to  Existing Homes (Sec. 1121, Page 208). This provides up to a $1,500 tax credit  for qualified energy efficiency improvements.
8. Sales Tax Deduction for Vehicle Purchases (Sec.  1008, Page 203). This allows people to write off state and local sales taxes  related to the purchase of a new vehicle costing up to $49,500.
9. Premium Credits for  COBRA Continuation Coverage for Unemployed Workers (Sec. 6432, Page 348)
10. Economic Recovery Credits to Recipients of  Social Security, SSI, Railroad Retirement and Veterans Disability Compensation  Benefits (Sec. 2201, Page 336). This was a $250 payment for senior citizens,  disabled veterans and disabled people living on Social Security benefits.
11. Computers as  Qualified Education Expenses in 529 Education Plans (Sec. 1005, Page 202). This  allows college students to write off the expense of computers and software,  provided it's for educational purpose and not for games.
12. Plug-in Electric  Drive Vehicle Credit (Sec. 1141, Page 212). Allows purchasers of plug-in  electric vehicles to write off up to $5,000 of their purchase (depending on the  power of the battery).
13. Tax Parity for Transit Benefits (sec. 1151, Page  219). This relates to an increased exclusion amount for commuter transit  benefits and transit passes.
14. Health Coverage Tax Credit Expansion (Sec. 1899,  Page 309).
Small  Business Tax Cuts:
1. Extension of Enhanced Small Business Expensing  (Sec. 1202, Page 221). This is a temporary increase in limitations on expensing  some depreciable business assets.
2. 5-Year Carryback of Net Operating Losses for Small  Businesses (Sec. 1211, Page 221).
3. Extension of Bonus Depreciation (Sec. 1201, Page  220). This extends by a year election to accelerate the AMT and Research Credits  in lieu of bonus depreciation.
4. Exclusion of 75% of Small Business Capital Gains  from Taxes (Sec. 1241, Page 228).
5. Temporary Small Business Estimated Tax Payment  Relief (Sec. 1212, Page 222).
6. Temporary Reduction of S Corporation Built-In  Gains Holding Period from 10 Years to 7 Years (Sec. 1251, Page 228).
Other Business Tax  Cuts:
1. Advanced Energy Investment Credit (Sec. 1302,  Page 231). This relates to properties designed to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions, such as those that produce
energy from  the sun, wind, geothermal deposits, fuel cells, microturbines, or an energy  storage system for use with electric or hybrid-electric vehicles.
2. Tax Credits for  Alternative Refueling Property (Sec. 1123, Page 211). This is a temporary  increase for alternative fuel vehicle refueling businesses.
3. Work Opportunity Tax Credits for Hiring  Unemployed Veterans and Disconnected Youth (Sec. 1221, Page 223). This is a tax  credit to provide incentive to businesses to hire unemployed veterans and  ""disconnected youth."" That latter term is defined, in part, as young adults ""not  readily employable by reason of lacking a sufficient number of basic skills.""
4. Delayed Recognition  of Certain Cancellation of Debt Income (Sec. 1231, Page 224).
5. Election to  Accelerate Recognition of Historic AMT/R&D Credits (Sec. 1201, Page 220).
Grand total: 25.
In all, tax cuts  amounted to about a third of the cost of the $862 billion stimulus over the next  decade. The biggest ticket tax cut was the first one on the list, the Making  Work Pay tax cut that is expected to cost the government about $116 billion over  two years. Interestingly, the White House did not include the Alternative  Minimum Tax patch, which has been extended annually for years. But that  accounted for another $70 billion for one year. Together, those two items  account for the lion's share of the tax cuts in the stimulus.
Which leads us to the  question of whether all of these 25 qualify as tax cuts?
""In a way this reminds  me of Clinton's 'It depends on what your meaning of is is' comments,"" said  Rosanne Altshuler, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""It depends on  what you mean by tax cuts.""
""These are all provisions that cut your taxes,"" she  said, ""but most of them are temporary,"" designed to stimulate a floundering  economy.
Each of  the tax provisions in the stimulus could have been broken into separate bills,  said Bob Williams, also of the Tax Policy Center, and on their own could have  rightly been billed as separate tax cuts.
""They packed an awful lot into that bill,"" Williams  said. ""I think it's fair to say that various tax provisions in the stimulus  could be considered tax cuts. I don't think that's being deceptive.""
We agree.
But there's one other  element of Axelrod's claim, that the tax cuts were passed without the help of  Republicans.
The  stimulus passed the House with nary a Republican vote. And it passed the Senate  with just three (though we note that one of them, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,  is now a Democrat).
So it's certainly fair to say the stimulus passed  without the help of the Republican caucus.",1,David Axelrod
"""About 40 percent of Hispanic homeowners have subprime mortgages."" At a Univision debate in Miami on Sept. 9, 2007, Clinton was asked about the federal government's role in solving the mortgage crisis. She replied that the problem was particularly serious for Hispanics because ""about 40 percent of Hispanic homeowners have subprime mortgages.""
Government numbers indicate that's an accurate statement.
The most recent statistics compiled by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, cited in recent reports about the subprime lending crisis, say 40 percent of Hispanic homeowners have subprime mortgages. By comparison, 52 percent of black homeowners have subprime mortgages while only 19 percent of non-Hispanic whites do.",1,Hillary Clinton
"After J.D. Hayworth ""was voted out of Congress, he became a registered lobbyist"" who was ""paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on."" Less than two years after losing the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is embroiled in a tough Republican primary against former Rep. J.D. Hayworth.
In one recent TV ad, McCain attacks Hayworth for claiming to be an outsider.
The ad shows a limousine driving by a fancy building and then an unflattering black-and-white clip of Hayworth sharing the screen with an airborne corporate jet and floating paper money. ""J.D. Hayworth says he's an outsider, but after he was voted out of Congress he became a registered lobbyist,"" the narrator intones. ""Hayworth was paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on.""
We decided to check to see if this description is accurate.
First, the add is correct that Hayworth was voted out of office. He lost in the landslide of 2006 to his Democratic challenger, Harry Mitchell.
Now for the lobbying claim. By law, all registered lobbyists must periodically file disclosure forms with the U.S. House and Senate, and we were able to locate two filed by Hayworth. In February 2008, Hayworth filed a form serving notice that he would be a paid lobbyist for the Wealth Transfer Group, based in Altamonte Springs, Fla. A separate but related form filed two months later disclosed that Hayworth was paid $10,000 by his client.
The forms also say that Hayworth's subject areas for lobbying would be tax and copyright issues. The tax issue falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee, which used to count Hayworth among its members.
Based on contemporary news accounts, it's likely that the Wealth Transfer Group hired Hayworth to lobby against possible restrictions on patenting ""tax reduction strategies."" These are approaches to limiting one's tax liability that are so unique that they have been granted patents by the federal government. The Wealth Transfer Group owns -- and has defended in court -- a patent on a technique for limiting the tax liability on certain kinds of stock options. The company's website says that the company only works on estates exceeding $10 million.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ""wrote leaders of several congressional committees urging them to limit tax-strategy patents. These patents 'undermine the integrity, fairness and administration' of the tax system and are 'contrary to sound public policy,' the institute said.""
The forms cited here were the only two related to Hayworth included in the congressional disclosure-form database, which is considered definitive. So the Wealth Transfer Group gig appears to have been his only lobbying job after leaving Congress. And in the grand scheme of Washington lobbying, having one client for a couple months that paid $10,000 is pretty small peanuts.
Still, these forms show enough information to make McCain's ad accurate. Hayworth was indeed a registered lobbyist, he worked for a Florida company, and he said he would be lobbying on tax issues, which meant targeting his old colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee.",1,John McCain
"""There are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program."" In a sharp exchange with John Edwards during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton made the case that she has a well-established record of fighting for change. She pointed to her role in starting the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP. The program, created in 1997, promotes health coverage for children by providing  federal funding to states. The states then put up their own money and set rules to provide care for uninsured children.
""There are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program,"" Clinton said.
Clinton's number is correct. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in June 2006, there were 7,688 children enrolled in SCHIP in New Hampshire.
Clinton is also on solid ground saying that she helped to create SCHIP. Much of the credit for SCHIP usually goes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. But the Clinton campaign has said previously that she used her influence behind the scenes to push for SCHIP, and there is evidence to support that.
Soon after the legislation passed, the   New York Times  reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support.""
In a previous campaign ad, Clinton claimed credit for SCHIP without any qualifiers, and we found that contention Half True, given the other people who had a hand in passing the legislation. (See that ruling here .) But in this case, she accurately said she helped to create SCHIP (as in she wasn't the only one), and she got the number right on how many children are enrolled in New Hampshire.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Some Republicans who voted against the stimulus ""have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. They come to the ribbon cuttings."" Twice recently, President Barack Obama has slammed congressional Republicans for voting against his economic stimulus bill in February 2009 but later touting provisions of the bill that benefited their own constituents.
During his Jan. 29, 2010, question-and-answer session with House Republican lawmakers in Baltimore, Obama brought up the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus is officially known:
""There was an interesting headline in CNN today: 'Americans disapprove of stimulus, but like every policy in it.' And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into its component parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 80 percent approved of the infrastructure, 80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed. Well, that's what the Recovery Act was. And let's face it, some of you have been at the ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities.""
Then, on Feb. 2, 2010, Obama riffed on the same theme during a town hall event in New Hampshire:
""I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act -- and claim that it hasn’t worked -- have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. (Applause.) They come to the ribbon-cuttings and ... (laughter). They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too. (Laughter.)""
We decided that a claim that bold, repeated in two high-profile events within a week's time, was worth a fact-check.
As it turns out, we found several cases in which lawmakers voted against the measure but later claimed credit for provisions or projects stemming from the stimulus bill.
-- Rep. Don Young of Alaska. Young, who has served in Congress since 1973, sent out two press releases on Feb. 13, 2009, the day the House passed the final version of the stimulus bill.
One was headlined, ""Rep. Young Votes NO On Democrats’ Massive Spending Bill."" It quotes Young saying, ""This bill was not a stimulus bill, it was a vehicle for pet projects, and that’s wrong.""
Young's second release of the day was headlined, ""Rep. Young Wins Victory For Alaska Small Business."" It explains how Young, after lobbying by the Alaska Federation of Natives, targeted a provision from the stimulus bill that would have required competitive bidding for stimulus grants and contracts. The Alaska Natives group said the provision could have hurt its members' ability to benefit from Small Business Administration programs. Young, the release said, ""worked with Members on the other side of the aisle to make the case for these programs, and was able to get the provision pulled from the bill.""
In the release, Young said that “no matter if I supported this bill or not, I would make sure [Alaska Natives] were not hurt by it.""
-- Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky. Davis, a three-term congressman, issued a news release on Jan. 28, 2009, the day of the first House vote on the stimulus, in which he was quoted saying that ""this so-called ‘stimulus’ legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs.""
But 11 months later, on Dec. 16, 2009, Davis sent out a release announcing the awarding of a $1 million-plus grant for the Carroll County School District. ""Congressman Geoff Davis is pleased to announce that the Carroll County School District has been awarded $1,044,140 in funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Early Head Start Expansion Program,"" the release stated. It goes on to say, ""In these difficult economic times, it is critical to ensure that vulnerable populations in Kentucky have access to important support services like those provided by the Early Head Start program. This important grant will allow Carroll County School District to expand their ability to provide needed assistance to local low-income families and children. I am very proud of the work that the Carroll County School District is doing to strengthen their community, and I am pleased that our office was able to assist them in obtaining these funds.”
As it happened, on the very same day, Davis sent out a separate release in which he referred to the ""failed trillion-dollar 'stimulus' bill.""
-- Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. Shuster, elected in 2001, is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. During the stimulus debate, he advocated for targeting the measure more directly toward infrastructure spending. A Jan. 28, 2009, news release from his office said that ""President Obama told the American people that he would stimulate our economy by rejuvenating our infrastructure. As a longtime advocate of improving our nation’s infrastructure, Shuster was encouraged by this announcement. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress, led by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, squandered this historic opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the backbone of our economy in order to fund 40 years of pent-up liberal pet projects.""
In November, the Blairsville (Pa.) Dispatch reported that Shuster attended a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new facility at a sewage treatment plant in Blairsville. According to the newspaper, the $12.1 million project was funded in part by federal stimulus money.
-- Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia. In a Feb. 13, 2009, news release, Gingrey, a four-term congressman, explained his vote by saying that ""this ‘stimulus’ bill only perpetuates the dangerous myth that government spending will fix this economy. ... The truth is government spending will only bury future generations in more debt.""
In October, a photograph in the Cedartown (Ga.) Standard showed Gingrey handing over a giant, ceremonial check for $625,000 in stimulus money to municipal leaders. The money was to pay for ""new sidewalks, landscaping and other improvements to the downtown area,"" according to the newspaper. A Gingrey spokeswoman told the Standard that because the project qualified for federal stimulus funds as ""shovel-ready,"" Gingrey ""presented the proposal at the federal level.""
City commissioner Scott Tillery described Gingrey to the newspaper as ""our point man when we need action from the federal government. His staff is always interested and involved in local concerns, and the congressman will use his influence to make a case for his constituents.""
-- Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr voted against the stimulus yet appeared in person to present a $2 million-plus stimulus grant to help build a fire station to house the Bethlehem Community Volunteer Fire Department.
""This is a great thing for this county,"" Burr said, according to the Hickory (N.C.) Daily Record. ""We're not accustomed to federal dollars in that magnitude finding their way to North Carolina.""
A spokesman for Burr told the Associated Press in October that he wasn't taking credit for the money. ""Sen. Burr was invited to the grant presentation by the Alexander County commissioners and was happy to be there to recognize the community and the fire department for their work in securing this highly competitive grant,'' the spokesman said.
In an interview with Politico, Burr added, “Just because I voted against the stimulus doesn’t mean I shouldn’t recognize the merit achievement of an entity.”
None of the four House members cited above responded to a query from PolitiFact. But the spokesman for one senior Republican lawmaker -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia -- did return our call. He argued that the Democratic criticism is overblown.
Cantor, a leading stimulus opponent, has taken heat from Democrats for organizing a job fair whose participating employers benefited from stimulus funding, as well as for helping local officials lobby for stimulus money to support a high-speed rail link between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va.
Brad Dayspring, Cantor's spokesman, defended both efforts, saying that, in the first case, the congressman was simply trying to help his unemployed constituents get back to work, and, in the second case, he was continuing his longstanding efforts to boost high-speed rail. Cantor's advocacy on the rail issue dates back a decade, to his tenure in the Virginia legislature.
On the broader question of why Cantor opted not to support the bill, Dayspring said that the congressman made his decision based on his opposition to the vast majority of the bill's provisions. ""The bill was so flawed, he voted against it despite his overwhelming support"" for the rail provision, Dayspring said. ""If you support 1 percent of a bill and oppose 99 percent, are you expected to vote for it?""
Let's return to Obama's claim. The president said that Republicans who voted against the stimulus ""have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced."" We found at least two lawmakers -- Young and Davis -- who aggressively criticized the stimulus bill yet sent out a news release touting their own role in helping constituents benefit from the bill. In the meantime, Obama also said that some opponents of the stimulus have ""come to the ribbon cuttings"" for projects funded by the bill. Shuster, Gingrey and Burr clearly attended such ceremonies. To us, five clear cases are enough to validate the president's assertion that some stimulus opponents have ""found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too.",1,Barack Obama

The number comes from two reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, two groups that conduct an annual survey on employer health benefits.

"""I'm for a three-state political solution in Iraq. (Romney) is not."" Indeed, Brownback teamed up with Sen. Joe Biden to propose a plan to partition Iraq into three states for the Kurds, Shi'ites and Sunnis with a central government to see to common interests.
Brownback fairly characterizes Romney's position. Romney has not endorsed the plan and published an essay in the July-August issue of Foreign Affairs saying he was opposed to the concept.
""Today, the nation's attention is focused on Iraq,"" he wrote. ""All Americans want U.S. troops to come home as soon as possible. But walking away now or dividing Iraq up into parts and walking away later would present grave risks to the United States and the world. Iran could seize the Shiite south, al Qaeda could dominate the Sunni west, and Kurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey. A regional conflict could ensue, perhaps even requiring the return of U.S. troops under far worse circumstances.""",1,Sam Brownback

The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America ""into the ground,"" on the basis of Santa ""always having been white in the Bible,"" and, ""No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,""

The article claimed that the pilot and co-pilot of the plane were combat vets who did not take kindly to Saints players partaking in the ""Take A Knee"" protest and decided to take a knee of their own and exit the plane.
""Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they’re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they’re told to do in the league rulebook."" said the post.

"""Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory"" An undated post on CNewsGo.com claimed that President Donald Trump had finally confirmed the rumor of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory, but the story continues to be nothing more than a hoax.
The unnamed author claimed Jamaica has become a permanently inhabited territory of the United States with its own organized government as determined by an Organic Act passed by Congress. There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news.
This is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day.
Trump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory.
This story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn’t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States. The fourth-largest island in the Caribbean is in fact located about 90 miles south of Cuba. The country does not require visas for visits under six months, but it does require passports from U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
The rumor dates back to February of this year, when Mediamaxzone.com reported falsely that the Jamaican prime minister had hinted Jamaica would become a U.S. territory. While it has been circulating for a while, it’s time we shed light on this hoax.",0,Bloggers

During his tenure in the House, various measures limiting gun ownership have been considered. Here is a sampling: In 1999, the Columbine massacre instigated gun-control legislation. Amendments to gun show background check legislation would have limited ownership. He voted against prohibiting violent juvenile offenders from ever owning a gun. He also opposed keeping semiautomatic assault weapons from the hands of juveniles.

"""Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions"" on health care.

Tom Price, a Republican from Georgia, complained that Obama has been hostile toward GOP suggestions on health care.
""You have repeatedly said, most recently at -- at the State of the Union, that Republicans have offered no ideas and no solutions,"" Price said on Jan. 29, 2010.
""I don't think I said that,"" Obama replied. ""What I said was within the context of health care -- I remember that speech pretty well. It was only two days ago. . . . I said I'd welcome ideas that you might provide. I didn't say that you haven't provided ideas. I said I'd welcome those ideas that you'll provide.""
Price then said, ""Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions, in spite of the fact that we've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions to all of the challenges we face, including energy and the economy and health care.""
Because Price appeared to correct himself after Obama's reply, we decided to focus on the second claim, that people in Obama's administration have made ""statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions."" Price spokesman Brendan Buck provided a couple of examples and we found a couple of our own:
• At a picnic with labor officials in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 7, 2009, Obama complained that the critics of health care reform -- he didn't identify them as Republicans, but it was clear he was referring to them -- were not offering their own solutions. He said, ""I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? What's your answer? What's your solution? And you know what? They don't have one. Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing.""
• A White House blog post attacking the Republican health care plan said it offered ""no ideas."" (The posting appears to have a typo. It reads: ""The Republican bill offers new no ideas."")
• White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on April 19, 2009, described the Republicans as ""the party of never . . . the party of no new ideas."" (He was referring not just to health care, but also to fiscal discipline.)
• At a White House briefing April 28, 2009, press secretary Robert Gibbs made a similar comment: ""I think you heard me and others say that you can't just be the party of no or the party of no new ideas.""
The White House doesn't dispute that aides have portrayed Republicans that way, but a spokeswoman said the Democratic health care plan includes many amendments that were proposed by Republicans.
Still, Price is right. Obama and his aides have said the Republicans have no ideas on health care and other issues.",1,Tom Price

While it’s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there’s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims.

But there’s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so.
This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.",0,Bloggers
"""Mar-A-Lago (was) destroyed by (Hurricane) Irma (and) Jared Kushner (is) still missing."" A fake news article claims that Jared Kushner is missing after Hurricane Irma destroyed President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where Kushner was holed up during the storm.
""Mar-A-Lago Destroyed By Irma--Jared Kushner Still Missing,"" blares the headline from a website called ""Freedumjunkshun.""
In fact, Kushner, a White House senior adviser, was seen on the South Lawn of the White House at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a day after Irma moved across the Florida peninsula.
Attempts to contact the Trump Organization and Mar-a-Lago resort to inquire into any possible structural damage were unsuccessful. Multiple articles reveal that the Palm Beach resort and its surrounding area had been evacuated days before Irma reached Florida.
Freedumjunkshun is a self-avowed fake news website that hopes to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its dim-witted satire for truth.

"""FBI RAIDS OBAMA – Find Massive Secret That Was Hidden For YEARS."" A website trying to trick voters into a click says in a headline, ""FBI RAIDS OBAMA – Find Massive Secret That Was Hidden For YEARS."" But the story is not nearly as explosive as it sounds.
The website maxipolitics.com posted the story originally in February, but it’s continuing to be shared on Facebook. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.

"Says Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry have donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. Three similarly worded posts published on News360-tv.com said Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry had each donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. They haven’t.
Pacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief.
While other celebrities are indeed pledging thousands to the cause, these magnanimous donations haven’t been reported on any credible news sites, and the celebrities have not made any such announcements on social media.
The stories about Bolt and Pacquiao used almost the exact same wording as a story we’ve already debunked claiming boxer Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million for hurricane relief.
They each started with the quip ""To whom much is given, much is expected."" They also falsely claimed the athletes had traveled to Houston and attributed the same quotes to each.
""It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,"" the stories attributed to Bolt, Pacquiao and Mayweather all say.

The story quotes Stone as saying that even though she originally wanted Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, she has come to realize that America made a great choice electing Trump. That didn’t happen.
In reality, Stone called the results of the 2016 election ""incredibly painful."" Clinton and Stone have also been photographed together backstage at the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
The story includes a doctored image of Stone wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. It was photoshopped from a real photo taken of her at Disneyland in 2015. Stone was wearing a navy blue hat with a Mickey Mouse logo, but the article removed the logo replacing it with Trump’s campaign slogan.
The article also claims that Stone stated that she is not usually involved in politics. Though Stone has said that she has stayed quiet in publicly expressing her opinions , she has recently said that she is speaking out more often.
Stone has supported equal pay for men and women and Planned Parenthood .

The headline read, ""Michelle Obama: ‘Florida shooting is clearly Trump’s fault, these shootings are happening constantly since he became our president.""
The news brief said Obama made those comments ""in Chicago amid the Obama Foundation worldwide event.""

"""Kim Jong Un killed in (President Donald) Trump’s overnight black op attack on North Korea.""

""Report: Kim Jong Un killed in (President Donald) Trump’s overnight black op attack on North Korea,"" read the headline on a July 28, 2017, ArmyUSANews.com post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news.
The story said that 17 SEAL teams struck multiple targets, and that ""in three hours time, the entire military infrastructure of that country has been eliminated,"" according to a reporter. Kim was reportedly killed, although state media played a ""death to America"" speech recorded years ago, the article said.
Kim Jong Un’s death has not been reported widely because this coordinated attack did not happen. The story is fake. (The photo showing a North Korean city on fire is actually a British hospital burning .)
It originated on July 23 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org , a website run by a self-described liberal troll who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers.

"""Breaking: Trump fires deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate."" A fake news headline stated that President Donald Trump has fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who tapped former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate connections between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.
""Breaking: Trump fires deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate,"" stated the Dec. 8 headline posted on Houstonchronicle-tv.com, an imposter website that mimics a real newspaper's name.
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is phony.
A spokesman for the Justice Department, Ian Prior, confirmed for PolitiFact that Rosenstein remains deputy attorney general . Rosenstein first joined the Justice Department in 1990, and Trump nominated him as deputy attorney general in January. The Senate confirmed his nomination on April 25.
Rosenstein oversaw the Russia inquiry at the Justice Department after Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed in March to recuse himself from all proceedings related to the Russia investigation.
In May, Rosenstein wrote a memo recommending that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey because of how he handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. When Trump fired Comey, the White House made public Rosenstein’s memo .
But recently, Trump has been critical of the Justice Department.
In a Dec. 2 tweet , Trump wrote, ""Many people in our Country are asking what the ""Justice"" Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and ""acid washed"" 33,000 Emails? No justice!""
Trump tweeted a day after Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to federal investigators related to lying to the FBI that he hadn’t spoken about sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story has no evidence and is fake news. The story attributes the information to Ladies of Liberty , a website that describes itself as satire.
Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In May, Pelosi supported Mueller’s appointment as a ""first step"" but in October called for an ""outside, fully independent investigation.""
The Patriot Report said that Pelosi and Mueller had a 13-year affair that will force Mueller to resign, but Pelosi will hold her California congressional seat until she dies.
The story said that Pelosi said her husband was aware of the affair and that her ""husband was afforded the same freedom to explore 'pleasures of the flesh.' ""
Pelosi has never made any such comment.
Fictional affairs are common fodder on fake news websites. We previously debunked fake articles claiming that U.S. Rep.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story is made up.
The story said that ""the three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the danger of mass destruction that may be called domestic terrorism.""

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake article has been circulating at least for a few months on Facebook. The end of the article directs readers to Channel50news , a prank website.
The dateline on the story says Sept. 20, 2016, but when we read the oldest comments at the bottom of the story, they started on Sept. 20, 2017.
Another hint that this is fake news is that the three-paragraph article has typos or sentences that make no sense:
""President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare.""
While this fake story suggests that the federal government is wiping out child support, it’s worth noting that states set child support policies and have enforcement programs .

The story cited ChristianTimesNewspaper.com as reporting Clinton filed a divorce petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County.
We know the story isn’t real, because this exact same hoax has circulated online before.
The ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, which was a website that trafficked in fake news, tried to sell people the exact same story on Nov. 10, 2016 , after Clinton lost the election to President Donald Trump. The website, which now appears to be offline , did not carry a disclaimer identifying its news as fabricated. It did say it ""does not take responsibility for any of our readers' actions that may result from reading our stories.""
Some minor details of the ChristianTimesNewspaper.com story have been changed, but USANewsToday.org — and several other fake news websites , as well — reproduced essentially the same story in February. USANewsToday.org is a clickbait site registered to an address in Macedonia , where fake news is a lucrative cottage industry .
This mirrors a minor trend we’ve seen with fake news, in which a fabricated story that originally was posted weeks or months ago is suddenly resurrected and regains popularity.
While the original version of this story came after Clinton’s presidential campaign loss, we can only make an educated guess as to the reason why this claim made a comeback. Valentine’s Day, maybe?

None of this is true. The Last Line of Defense is a satirical site that tries to fool conservatives into clicking on false headlines. The author’s work, which we’ve debunked before , often ends up on other fake news sites.

The Cambridge Police Department daily log , an overview of the department's daily calls for service, does not mention an attack involving 10 assailants, Antifa or any of the names listed in the fake news article.
The department’s News & Alerts page also does not have a post announcing the death of an Officer Patrick Farley, Malia’s fake arresting officer.

""FBI issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap,"" read the headlines on multiple fake news sites. Facebook flagged several claims as part of its efforts to weed out fake news from its news feeds.
These stories don’t have a grain of truth. There’s no warrant out for Obama’s arrest, and he’s definitely not getting arrested by the FBI. We’ve also found no evidence to support Trump’s claim that the wiretapping even took place .
Most of the stories are all essentially identical, saying that Obama will be ""picked up by"" the FBI sometime today or be charged with unlawful use of authority for ordering an illegal wiretap on the phones in Trump Tower.

Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.""

""Mitt Romney: ‘Trump has some very serious emotional problems, he must resign before we…’,"" said a June 6, 2018, headline from International Flash News, an online blog. A few replica stories were posted under the same headline on other blog sites in May.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
The International Flash News story alleged that during an interview on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Romney said Trump ""has some very serious emotional problems."" The story also quoted Romney as suggesting Trump should resign over sexual misconduct claims and expressing concern regarding the president’s tweets about North Korea and domestic race relations.
We searched for the headline in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Romney made such a statement. Shimrit Sheetrit, director of Anderson Cooper 360, told us it has been several years since Romney was last featured as a guest on the show.
But as it turns out, we did find that the comments attributed to Romney in the false report were all at some point made by another former presidential candidate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt.
On Dec. 13, 2017, Sanders joined the set of Anderson Cooper 360 and said Trump ""has some very serious emotional problems"" in reference to a Twitter attack Trump made against U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. During the same interview, Sanders said Trump should resign because of the multiple sexual assault allegations levied against him.
The International Flash News story also included quotes that can be properly attributed to Sanders’ statement on  CBS This Morning  on Dec. 7, 2017. And Sanders — not Romney — has on multiple occasions accused Trump of ""trying to divide us up by the color of our skin,"" including on Nov. 12, 2017, while visiting CBS’s Face the Nation .
So the supposed Romney quote, along with several others included in the text of the story, is actually a misattribution of multiple different quotes from Sanders.",0,Bloggers
"""NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens."" Social media users were puzzled when an online blog resurfaced a years-old claim saying NASA has communicated with four separate alien races. This ridiculous claim can be traced back to satire from 2016.

"BREAKING: Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS Racist Democrats, Endorses Trump A fake news story says that the granddaughter of civil rights icon Rosa Parks praised President Donald Trump following racial unrest.
""Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, Endorses Trump,"" states the Nov. 4 headline on the website Reaganwasright . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The article states that Parks’ granddaughter defended Trump to denounce claims from ""Antifa"" protesters that Trump is a ""racist bigot"" and a ""traitor.""
The article quoted Parks’ supposed granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, speaking to students at Oxford University: ""This violence and destruction I see from my people is just unacceptable. My grandmother took a stand by sitting down, but she would never ‘sit down’ while our once-proud people cover their faces and commit violent acts in the streets.""
But the story is fake because Rosa Parks was childless when she died in 2005 at age 92 . The photo in the story is of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner .
Rosa Parks is a famous African-American civil rights icon who in 1955 refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala. The goal of the story appears to be to shock readers that a grandchild of Parks would side with Trump, who called the violence in Charlottesville a result of ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""
In August, we fact-checked a similar claim that ""Rosa Parks’ daughter praises (President Donald) Trump’s response to Charlottesville."" In that article, Parks’ daughter had a similar name: Muriel Parks-Rosenberg.
We messaged the website on Facebook and received a reply directing us to scroll to the bottom of the page. The disclaimer states: ""Nothing on this site is real. It is satire. Call it ""fan fiction"" if you prefer.""

"""2 million rounds of ammo that ‘went missing’ under Obama turns up in enemy hands"" Millions of rounds of U.S. ammunition hasn’t wound up in enemy hands, despite what a story circulating on Facebook claims. The story says the rounds disappeared during President Barack Obama’s presidency and were recently discovered in Afghanistan.
""2 million rounds of ammo that ‘went missing’ under Obama turns up in enemy hands,"" states the Nov. 13 headline in world-newss.com .
One of many signs that the article is fake is that the website misspelled ""news."" We left a comment on the website and did not hear a reply. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The article lists as its source a Nov. 9 article from defense-usa.club , another known peddler of deliberately false news stories.
The article attributes the information to ""an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon."" It states that the ammunition went missing in 2010 and was recently recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The article quoted Brig. General George Mason’s assistant chief of staff: ""This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the U.S. taxpayer. Sources say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama’s circle pocketed that money.""
All of that, however, appears to be made up.
We searched news accounts and found no mentions of missing ammunition discovered in Afghanistan. Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, told PolitiFact that there hasn’t been a recent discovery of 2 million U.S. rounds of ammunition in Afghanistan.
To top it off, ""We're not aware of a Brigadier General George Mason in any position of responsibility in Afghanistan,"" Rankine-Galloway said. ""There's no such thing as ‘the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.’ ""

While there are conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships of Monroe and the truth behind her death ruled by police as a probable suicide , there is no evidence that she was murdered in part of a cover-up.
When we tried to search for the quotes attributed to Hodges, we found no results or credible sources for them.

"""Soros, Obama and the Dems Ordered the Shutdown to Stage a Coup"" A fake news story is claiming that the government shutdown is the result of a Democratic order to stage a coup against President Donald Trump.
The Jan. 20 headline by a website called Reagan Was Right reads, ""Soros, Obama and the Dems Ordered the Shutdown to Stage a Coup."" Facebook users flagged this story as possibly providing false information, as part of the social network’s effort to combat fake news.
The story accuses a number of Democrats of organizing an overthrow of the White House during the federal government shutdown.
A supposed report from the Secret Service stated the possibility of a military coup against Trump. The article quotes Secret Service spokeswoman Sandy Batt as saying: ""The leaked report is no different from the dozens of others we act on everyday. The sources have been identified and we will deal with the situation if it arises. The President is safe.""
The story also claims four dozen snipers have roosted on the White House roof, and the D.C. airspace is shut down to all military and civilian aircraft with the exception of normally scheduled flights to Dulles and Marine 1.
None of this, however, is true. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel are still reporting to work, and the Federal Aviation Administration has continued air traffic control. Flight delays are not expected, and FAA safety inspections will continue.
The story claimed Sandy Batt as the spokesperson for the Secret Service, but there is no one by the name of Batt who speaks for the Secret Service. It also said that D.C. airspace is shutdown, but flights are running as normal.
Reagan Was Right, the site behind the story, describes itself as a ""whimsical playland of conservative satire."" It’s other disclaimer reads: ""Everything on this website is fiction."" The site is affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to ""feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.""

"""House Dems introduce bill to remove citizenship requirement from presidency."" A website with a patriotic moniker falsely claimed Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to remove the U.S. citizenship requirement to become president of the United States.
""Democrat Congressmen Pelosi and Keith Olbermann introduced H.B. 2169-B, which would remove the requirement that the President be born here,"" said a Sept. 18 post on Americannews88.com.
Several problems appeared right off of the bat. The post presumably refers to House Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, but Keith Olbermann is a political commentator, not a congressman. Also, bills originating in the House of Representatives are identified as "" H.R. "" not ""H.B."" No such H.B. 2169-B bill has been introduced.
A House bill bearing the numbers 2169 was introduced in April 2017 by Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., but it has nothing to do with removing the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president. That bill introduced by a Republican lawmaker seeks to improve information sharing among local and federal entities.
The fake news post claims Pelosi issued a statement saying her bill would allow someone to run for president if they have lived in the United States for two years.
""Asked if this would allow a foreign power to effectively take over the country or encourage terrorism, Pelosi explained that it would not because ‘the embrace of the American people would be enough to ensure that the person does their very best,’ "" said Americannews88.com’s post.
The website quotes ""Rep.Olbermann"" making the argument that if people from other countries come to the United States to run corporations, ""‘Why can’t we do that with the government? We can’t do worse than Trump’.""

"""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service."" A race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. senate seat features enough negative attacks to keep an army of fact-checkers busy.
Democrat Alexi Giannoulias' go-to dig has been numerous misstatements made by his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, about his military record.
An ad entitled ""On and On"" from the Giannoulias campaign hits on a number of them rapid-fire -- splicing Kirk's words with TV news commentary and print media reports calling Kirk out for misstatements. The idea is to paint Kirk as a ""typical Washington politician"" who cannot be trusted.
Kirk has copped to misspeaking and being ""careless"" with facts about his military records. We'll discuss each of the misstatements cited in the Giannoulias ad briefly before delving more deeply into one of the most recent and controversial claims in the ad, that, ""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""
Before we get started, though, here's a little on Kirk's military history. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer, and currently holds the rank of commander.
In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his ""phenomenal performance"" and described Kirk as ""a natural and charismatic leader"" and ""head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met."" Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009.
According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
For this item we are going to do a Truth-O-Meter ruling on Giannoulias' claim that Kirk ""did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.'' But before we get to that part of the ad, we're going to examine other quotes from Kirk that Giannoulias also uses in the ad.
""I was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year.""
This is perhaps the highest-profile of the military gaffes by Kirk, one he boasted about both on his resume and on the floor of Congress.
He didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk with the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet.
Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the “Intelligence Officer of the Year.""
""Most importantly, I wasn't thinking,"" Kirk said in a press conference. ""This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me.""
""I served in Iraq and Afghanistan.""
At other times, Kirk or his campaign literature have described him as ""a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom."" He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served ""during"" the operations. And again, his service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions.
""The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us.""
In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey, and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country.
In a June 4, 2010 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified ""that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo.""
""I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details,"" Kirk told the Sun-Times. ""And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize.""
""I command the war room in the Pentagon.""
Another misstatement. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, and acknowledged in an interview with Kirk, he commands one of two rooms -- the intelligence unit -- for eight hours at a time on his once-a-month weekend Naval reserve duties. Kirk told the newspaper he misspoke as he was trying to explain that to a civilian audience.
But our ruling here is on this claim by Giannoulias:
""He did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""
This was an issue first brought to light by blogger Terry Welch, who posted a Dec. 18, 2009, memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gail McGinn approving an exception to allow Kirk to train in Afghanistan. The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph:
""As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois, Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty. ... Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty. Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty, Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty.""
Kirk campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski released a statement: ""Mark Kirk has served our nation in the U.S. Navy for two decades and has done so honorably. The fact is, Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies. He has misspoken about his record, acknowledged it and apologized. Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities -- even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay. The memorandum in question is simply off the mark. Furthermore, this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirk's confidential records. The document in question should be viewed for what it is -- a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a U.S. Senate seat at any cost.""
The Pentagon, however, later clarified, saying that on two occasions, Kirk was ""counseled"" about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty, and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again, the AP reported.
Specifically, the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich being arrested. And in July 2009, Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidate's Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center.
According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces: ""In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement."" Specifically, the rules say that ""a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not ... participate in any radio, television, or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party, candidate, or cause.""
According to AP coverage of a Kirk press conference published on June 30, 2010, ""As Kirk apologized (for some of his misstatements about his military record), however, he also acknowledged something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago — that he was twice scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties.""
He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy, though.
The Giannoulias ad states, ""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service."" The Pentagon released a statement to AP saying that Kirk was twice ""counseled"" for mixing politics with military service. And we have a memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense referring to ""concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty.""
The fact that Kirk was merely ""counseled"" suggests these were not deemed terribly egregious violations of military policy. But the Pentagon did tell AP that Kirk signed a statement acknowledging that he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again. You don't sign such a statement if you aren't deemed to have skirted the rules. We rule this claim True.",1,Alexi Giannoulias
"""President (Donald) Trump pardons Kim Davis."" President Donald Trump’s pardon of controversial former sheriff Joe Arpaio led to a fake news site falsely claiming Trump also pardoned a controversial government clerk from Kentucky.
""BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis,"" read the headline on an Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The post appeared after Trump’s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio , the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5.
Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses.
She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed . The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit.
So Davis can’t get a pardon, because technically she wasn’t convicted of a federal crime . But it doesn’t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content.

The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
But the story that accompanied the flashy headline neither repeated nor provided evidence to back up the claims.
Trump’s eldest daughter and her husband, who enjoy an elevated status in the White House as both family members and advisers, indeed faced increased public scrutiny in the past week, but have not been kicked out of the West Wing.
The story correctly summarized news reports describing Kushner’s downgraded security designation, from top secret to secret clearance, following White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s decision to overhaul the security clearance process.
It also rehashed anonymously sourced news reports of internal White House turmoil regarding Kelly’s frustration with Ivanka’s White House tenure. The most recent source of tension was her attendance at the Olympic closing ceremony in South Korea.
While some editorial pages have suggested the couple should resign from their White House posts, no reputable news sources have announced their departure, let alone firing.
And the contents of Trump’s will -- and whether the couple has somehow been eliminated from it -- have not been reported by any credible sources, either.

"In Texas, ""the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose."" It's not unusual for a minority party to engage in soul-searching, finger-pointing and general agonizing over why it lost power. The Republican Party is in the midst of such a process right now.

We were intrigued by his claim — which he repeated on  Meet the Press  on June 14 — that Jose was the No. 1 baby name for boys in Texas. We wondered if that could be proved with hard numbers or if it was mostly conjecture.
It turns out that the Social Security Administration compiles baby names for infants born in the United States, based on applications for Social Security numbers. The administration includes a few caveats about the data — names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example. But it's hard to think of a better source for name popularity.
In 2008, the No. 1 name for a baby boy born in Texas was indeed Jose. (It's held the top spot since 1996.) Nationally, it was 41st.
In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael.
In case you're wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava.
We're not rating Murphy's political advice one way or the other. But the numbers confirm he had his facts right about Jose.",1,Mike Murphy
"""Colorado Rockies baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands."" A years-old fake news post about a Major League baseball club selling way more than Cracker Jack continues to burn readers who may be eager to partake of pot in the grandstand.
The headline on an EmpireSports.co story dated Feb. 28, 2014 , says it all: ""Colorado Rockies baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands.""
Except the team is doing no such thing, even though Colorado residents voted to decriminalize recreational marijuana in 2012. You might actually have to go outside Coors Field almost two entire city blocks or so to find recreational marijuana edibles, instead.
PolitiFact Colorado examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day , April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life.""
It’s anyone’s guess why this story continues to live on (we have some theories), but it has. It also was flagged by Facebook users as being fake.
The disclaimer from EmpireSports.co, which is now defunct and hasn’t posted a new sports story in a couple of years, notes it is ""a satirical and entertainment website"" that fabricates content. Another page labeled ""About Us"" further notes that ""sometimes we report things we just WISH would happen.""
There also hasn’t been any activity on EmpireSports.co’s Facebook or Twitter accounts since 2015. The home page does link to EmpireNews.net, a separate website that fabricates news stories and is still up and running.
The owner of  both sides , Aaron Smith, confirmed to us that all its new sports stories are now also posted on EmpireNews.net. Smith didn’t know why his three-year-old Rockies story was still being shared as if it were recent, but he said he hadn’t noticed any appreciable increase in hits recently. He directed people to his site’s disclaimer.

"""In the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did."" At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, ""Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did.""
We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that ""in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did.""
We found the relevant data for Canada at the website of Statistics Canada. For the month concluding in January 2011, Canada created a net 69,200 jobs.
For the U.S. numbers, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found Romney is correct. Over the same period, the U.S. created a net 36,000 jobs. So the U.S. created about half as many jobs even though it is nine times larger than Canada.
It's worth noting that U.S. job growth was substantially stronger than Canadian job growth in each of the previous three months. In October, the U.S. economy created 171,000 jobs, compared to just 3,000 for Canada. In November 2010, the U.S. economy created 93,000 jobs, compared to 15,200 for Canada. And in December 2010, the U.S. created 121,000 jobs, compared to 22,000 for Canada. But on a per capita basis, in recent months U.S. job creation exceeded Canada's only in October.
January happened to be a month when U.S. job creation was especially low and Canadian job creation was especially high, but it is the most recent month and it reflects the general pattern when you account for population.",1,Mitt Romney
"Says Pat Robertson said, ""We must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes."" The website USPOLN, already flagged as a fake news site on our handy guide , recycled an evocative bit of fakery about television evangelist Pat Robertson that dates from 2015.
Allegedly drawing on an installment of Robertson’s show The 700 Club, the post begins with Robertson warning that legal rights of gays and lesbians will draw down God’s wrath upon America. It then goes off the rails.
The article says a caller asks if this disaster can be averted. To which Robertson replies, ""The only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people. I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official.""
Facebook readers flagged this as likely fake news, and in fact, the article provides a link to its source, an item from the fake news site Newslo that was debunked by Snopes in early November 2015.
Robertson never said those words, but if the goal is to drive traffic, passing them off as real seems to work. The 2015 version drew snarky comments from a website in the United Kingdom , and the latest verbatim copy pulled in angry responses from those who also took it as real. One commenter said, ""I think God will go after him and his fortune for being close-minded and prejudiced. The Bible teaches us to love each other no matter who they are.""
President Donald Trump’s White House win seems to have increased the popularity of false news items that fuel the ire of liberals. So far the evidence is anecdotal, but the standard rule to stem the spread of faux news applies: If the headline alone inspires outrage, pause before sharing. Then look for the tell-tale signs of fake news, such as a lack of sources, no date of publication and the presence of click-bait ads all around the page.

"""Trey Gowdy is the new director of the FBI!"" An online post that declared U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was appointed head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared to be another instance of a fake headline placed atop an old story only advocating for the move.
""Just in today: Trey Gowdy is the new director of the FBI!"" read the headline on a June 23, 2017, post on Snoopack.com . Facebook users flagged the post as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news.
The post touts that Gowdy, the new head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , had been noted as a potential replacement for ousted FBI Director James Comey. But it didn’t mention anything about that being a done deal, as the headline said.
Indeed, there was talk in May that Gowdy was a potential candidate to replace Comey , but Gowdy took himself out of the running on May 15 . He tweeted that he ""would not be the right person"" to take the job.
The Snoopack.com post is an uncredited copy of a March 29 post from AngryPatriotMovement.com , which initially carried the headline, ""Petition: Appoint Trey Gowdy as director of the FBI.""
That original post went on for longer than the Snoopack.com version, and asked readers to share the post on Facebook to show support for Gowdy. TeaParty.org also copied the AngryPatriotMovement.com post, crediting the site and adding an online petition form .
There’s no indication why the post about Gowdy, who has been the target of fake news before , was resurrected on June 23. Snoopack.com did not reply when we sent them an email via their online submission form.
On June 7 , President Donald Trump nominated Christopher Wray to head the FBI. Wray must be confirmed by the Senate.

"""Hillary (Clinton) caught on tape laughing about (Hurricane) Irma ‘wiping out all of those Florida hillbillies’."" A bogus news story claimed that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told Rachel Maddow it would be better if Hurricane Irma destroyed Florida, but the post really came from a website that is part of a network of Internet trolls.
A headline on an Oct. 16, 2017, post on the suspiciously named lmaoitsnews.website read, ""Hillary caught on tape laughing about Irma ‘wiping out all of those Florida hillbillies’."" Facebook users reported the story as being potentially made up, as part of the social media company’s efforts to combat fake news.
The post, which we found on several other websites , said that Clinton was shooting an undated interview for The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC when she slammed the Sunshine State and its residents.
""To be honest, Rachel, it would probably be good for the country if Irma were to just wipe every Florida hillbilly off the map,"" the post quoted Clinton. ""I mean … they live in trailers by the water, right?""
The lmaoitsnews.website story said Maddow was shocked by Clinton’s statement, canceling the interview and agreeing to hide the recording. The post claimed a sound engineer smuggled the recording out to release to the public should he need to ""save the country or himself.""
Clinton didn’t make these remarks, however, because this story is sourced to a post that originally ran Sept. 10 ( when Irma swept across Florida ) on the website AsAmericanAsApplePie.org.
AsAmericanAsApplePie.org appears to be part of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who publishes fabricated stories in an attempt to trick conservative readers.

"""Youngest world leader bans George Soros’s Foundations from Austria."" A popular article on Facebook claims that Austria's incoming chancellor Sebastian Kurz has banned George Soros’ Open Society Foundations from the country.
This is a fabricated tale made by a notorious fake news website.
With the headline, ""Youngest world leader bans George Soros’s Foundations from Austria,"" the YourNewsWire.com post said that the made-up ban was in response to Soros’ $18 billion donation to the organization, making it the second-biggest philanthropic organization in the United States.
The article said that Kurz gave the organization 28 days to ""cease and desist operations in Austria."" The story falsely said the incoming chancellor called Soros ""the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017.""
The fake story goes on to quote Kurz describing Soros as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money"" — language identical to a 2010 Rolling Stone piece about Goldman Sachs by Matt Taibbi.
Besides Soros’ massive donation and Kurz’s young leader status (he’s 31), this story is complete bogus.
Open Society Foundations, an organization with efforts in different countries all over the world, has no offices in Austria — and therefore nothing to ""cease and desist.""
We couldn’t find any record of Kurz describing Soros in that light or commenting on OSF.
Soros was implicated during Kurz’s campaign when a Facebook page called ""The Truth About Sebastian Kurz"" accused the future chancellor, who supports low levels of immigration , of conspiring with Soros to let in a new wave of refugees. The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz’s opponent, Christian Kern .

"""Pope Francis To Followers: 'Koran And Holy Bible Are The Same' "" An obscure website’s report that Pope Francis called the holy texts of Islam and Christianity the same is actually a fake news story that first appeared two years ago.
A Dec. 21, 2016, headline on the website USA Snich read, ""Pope Francis To Followers: ‘Koran And Holy Bible Are The Same’,"" claiming the pontiff said as much in an hourlong visit with Vatican visitors. The story said Francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid, and that the time is ripe for ""merging our faiths.""
Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts with PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites to debunk potentially fake news.
To be clear, we can find no evidence Francis ever said such a thing, although the story persists on Facebook with links tracking back to a variety of websites .
The post refers to the Monday prior to its publication, which would have been Dec. 19. Francis did speak to a group that day, telling Italian children to spend time with their grandparents .
USA Snich is another website that appears to mix fake news and real events, sometimes posting stories that are entirely fabricated like this one. As its ""source,"" it shared a non-working link to the website WashingtonPost.com.co . Websites with .co after a legitimate media outlet’s name often are associated with fake news, like ABCNews.com.co and NBC.com.co .

"Says Maxine Waters told CNN, ""SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant."" As the nation awaits President Donald Trump’s announcement of a nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, social media has erupted with chatter from politicians and pundits about the potential pick.
Another person dominating the internet space has been U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she told protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico.
Waters has been under constant fire from conservatives — including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks — for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a target of several false reports and internet memes.
The latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an ""illegal immigrant"" should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice.
""Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant,"" said the chyron in what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by Trump Nation , a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, ""It’s the only way the Democrats can ever win again.""
In a comment accompanying the image, the post said: ""... and this is why WE don't watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree …""
But, as several media outlets were quick to point out, the image is fake.
The screenshot was likely lifted from an Oct. 24, 2017, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo in which Waters explained what she had meant when she said she would ""take Trump out."" In the original clip, Waters can be seen wearing the same attire and jewelry — and speaking in front of the same backdrop — as in the doctored photo. She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant.

"Says Sandra Bullock said to Hillary Clinton, ""If you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again."" A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.
""Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’"" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.
While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.
The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.
At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.
""I don’t agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.""
The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.
""I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,"" she says. ""When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.""

"""Update: Chuck Schumer’s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed."" U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer was busted by his own daughter for having an affair with a teenager, according to a fake news story making the rounds on Facebook.
""Update: Chuck Schumer’s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed,"" stated a headline in USA In Front Dec. 10.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This fake story had been shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook within just a few days. Schumer’s spokesman declined to comment to PolitiFact, and no one from the website responded to our email.
The story stated that Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with his daughter Lisa’s best friend from high school, a 16-year-old who later committed suicide. Schumer’s wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl’s mother $2 million, the article stated.
In reality, Schumer’s wife is named Iris and his daughters are Jessica and Alison .
USA In Front claims proof via the cheerleader’s mother and Planned Parenthood records, but offers no actual evidence.
The article portrays Schumer as a hypocrite for opposing the candidacy of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama race Dec. 12. In November, the  Washington Post reported that Moore, while he was in his 30s, had pursued relationships with teenage girls, according to the women. Several fake news stories have made up claims related to Moore.
This article appears to be a rip off of an earlier version on Last Line of Defense , a notorious fake news website that identifies itself as satire. That version had some more fictional details such as that Schumer spent a ton of money on the girl at Steak and Shake and Victoria’s Secret.
These fake news stories about Schumer having an affair with a teenage teenager were posted a few days before an unrelated story in the  New York Times  about false allegations by a former Schumer staff member of sexual harassment by Schumer.
Schumer’s staff filed a report to the Capitol Police that a fraudulent document that resembled a court filing described false allegations. The former staff member told the New York Times that the harassment claims were ""completely false."" The former staff member spoke to the New York Times on the condition of anonymity.

"""Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead."" A fake story being shared on social media about Japanese whalers meeting an untimely end in the bellies of a pod of orcas may sound fishy for a reason — it is.
""Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead,"" shouts a horror-show headline on a Feb. 11, 2017, post on ReligionMind.com. Facebook brought the post to our attention as potentially being fake as part of its efforts to eliminate false stories from its news feeds.
The story — which again, didn’t happen — recounts the fate of the hapless crew of the whaler MV Nisshin Maru, many of whom abandoned ship after a gas leak forced them to clear the deck.
The ship was supposedly stranded in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, off the coast of South Africa. In a twist of irony too dark to be true (because it isn’t), 16 whalers were swallowed by killer whales within a half hour of hitting the water.
The yarn cast a wide net, landing on several websites , with one version of the article posted as late as Feb. 12 . But we didn’t take the bait.
The origin of this fish tale (yes, we know killer whales are mammals) goes all the way back to July 28, 2014. That’s when WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting contrived stories, first published the saga of the Nisshin Maru .
The story was pretty popular back then, too, because several media outlets wrote articles to point out it was a made-up story. Nearly all of them made reference to the site’s disclaimer , which reads, ""All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news.""
There’s no indication on the various posts we found identifying the story is fake. There’s also no mention that it is several years old.

The Sept. 5, 2017, post said Irma was on a path to obliterate New York City’s five boroughs and most of New Jersey, and that it was set to make landfall in New York Harbor as a Category 5 hurricane at noon on Sept. 10, 2017.
The post cites a National Hurricane Center storm projection from Sept. 1, 2017. But the only projection made that day was that the storm, then a Category 2, was moving in the direction of the Caribbean, and it was too early to tell where it would make landfall.
The National Weather Service's most recently issued hurricane and storm surge watches in portions of South Florida and the Florida Keys. Forecasters expect the storm to reach South Florida by Sept. 9. Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Sept. 4.
It’s too soon to tell where the storm is headed next, and the National Weather Service hasn’t made any announcements on Irma’s potential impact on New York or New Jersey or on its future wind speed, which determines its category.
The post appeared on the advertising-filled site NewsPunch.com, which contains a disclaimer saying the site owners ""make no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information.""

The story claims that Willis called Trump the ""best U.S. president ever"" and that anyone who doesn’t like him should move to Canada.
The story revisits an interview Willis did with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon in 2015. But it doesn't make the story more credible.
Willis joked with Fallon suggesting that his natural hair looked a lot like Trump’s, poking fun at the idea. Photos then circulated of Willis wearing the signature ""Make America Great Again"" hat on the show, leading to a stream of stories claiming Willis was a Trump supporter.
The image even caught the attention of Trump, who tweeted that Willis was wearing his hat on the Tonight Show.
In reality, Fallon never asked if Willis supported Trump, and Willis never expressed support for Trump as a candidate.

""We got him: Obama just broke federal law in attempt to take over presidency from Trump,"" said the headline on March 18, 2018, on Universal News Portal, a blog promoting sensational headlines.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Obama tried to  overthrow the current president.
In the article, Obama is falsely accused of being obsessed with taking Trump down by establishing a shadow government outside the White House that recruits active members to protest Trump’s every move.
While there have been protests against policy decisions made by the Trump administration, there is no evidence to suggest that Obama influenced or administered them in any way. There is also no proof of an established shadow government, which has been referred to as a conspiracy theory by several news outlets .
Obama is also accused of urging senators not to repeal Obamacare without Trump’s knowledge and of following Trump to the G20 Summit in Germany in 2017, which PolitiFact already debunked last year. Obama’s spokesperson told us that he did not attend the event, nor was he in Germany at the time it took place. There have also been no reports of Obama meeting with senators to discuss fighting the repeal of Obamacare.
The alleged crime in the fake news story  is that Obama is supposedly held secret meetings with world leaders.
Since Obama is now out of office, doing so would be considered illegal under the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States or foreign governments.
While Obama has met with some world leaders , such as President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, it was part of a longstanding tradition of former presidents traveling overseas after leaving office to try and attract donations and support for their foundations, libraries and presidential centers.

The site inaccurately claims an annual lottery ""known as Green card Lottery"" is offering ""more than 55,000 permanent resident cards each year to every person from ‘underrepresented Countries,’ which has been less represented in employment and in family-based categories in Canada and who meets these two basic eligibility requirements.""
The website, bitcoingrower.life, is not an official website for the Canadian government and ""the program mentioned on that site is not a Canadian immigration program,"" said Carl Beauchamp, spokesman for the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada government agency.
Beauchamp said the agency encourages individuals to report any suspected fraudulent activities ""so that corrective measures are taken to address them.""
Canada’s programs and services are clearly and consistently identified with an official federal government wordmark , Beauchamp said. ""Consumers should exercise caution whenever they provide personal or financial information when applying online,"" Beauchamp added.
Bitcoingrower.life asks individuals interested in the program to submit photos of themselves, claims that registrations are accepted year-round, and that ""at no additional cost"" winners get interview preparation advice.
The website appears to base its post on the United States’ diversity visa program, which has been under the spotlight after false and misleading claims about it from President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has said a man accused of a terrorist attack in New York in October 2017 came to the United States through the diversity visa lottery program. ( Here’s more information about that U.S. program.)
Bitcoingrower.life muddles its own information by referencing both the United States and Canada in its post.

"""Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State"" A story on Facebook quotes actor Denzel Washington praising President Donald Trump and saying the United States dodged a bullet when Hillary Clinton lost, but the quotes are made up.
""Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian police state,"" said a Feb. 24 headline on USA Liberty Press , a conservative website. The same claim appeared on Your News Wire , a frequent purveyor of fake news , Feb. 3.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Washington made these statements.
The USA Liberty Press article included this alleged quote by Washington: ""I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State.""
We searched for that quote in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Washington made that statement.
The article doesn’t include any alleged quotes by Washington saying Trump avoided war with Russia.
USA Liberty Press also repeated a fake quote by Washington praising Trump: ""We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here. He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.""
In November 2016, we fact-checked the claim that Washington said that and found that the story plucked a quote from a March 5  New York Post  article where Charles Evers, the brother of late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, discussed his endorsement of Trump. Articles circulating on the Internet have falsely attributed the quote to Washington. We rated that statement Pants on Fire .
About a month later, when speaking before a screening of his new film Fences in Washington, D.C., in December 2016, Washington was asked whom he supported in the election. He quipped ""Fences"" but later said, ""none of your business.""

The lowest: 15.5 percent for Asian and Pacific-Islander. About 46 percent of Hispanic children were born to unmarried women, and 24.5 percent of white children.

"Obama ""won health care for 150,000 people."" In a campaign ad, an announcer says Obama ""won health care for 150,000 people.""
The statement is based on a 2003 law Obama sponsored when he was an Illinois state senator. His bill expanded income eligibility for KidsCare and FamilyCare, the state health insurance programs low-income families. Both programs saw sizable increases in enrollment after the law was passed.
The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the Illinois program and found that the children's enrollment increased by 55,421 between 2003 and 2005, the year Illinois abolished an income requirement. Adult enrollment increased by 100,458 between 2003 and 2006. That comes to a total of 155,879.
Of course, it bears noting that expansion of health insurance was a big goal of the Democratic governor who signed the bill, and Obama's legislation had a co-sponsor, a Republican, in the Illinois House. But the simplicity of his claim is hard to dispute, and being able to work with others to achieve goals is a theme of the ad in which he makes the claim. It all ads up to true.",1,Barack Obama
"""Singer Celine Dion Says: ‘I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country.’"" Canadian singer Celine Dion did not say she hates America, despite a hoax you might have seen online.
An April 11 headline falsely quoted Dion as saying, ""I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Dion said either of these things.
The rumor originated on a clickbait website in September 2017 , according to Snopes .
The story doesn’t support the headline. Instead, it talks about how Dion turned down an offer to sing at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. In January 2017, news outlets such as TMZ reported that Dion passed up the opportunity, but not because she hates America.
Dion was actually scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration, which we were able to confirm with an archived version of her  2017 schedule .
After a few paragraphs repeating the same information, the story cuts to a YouTube video with a thumbnail of Dion. The 59-second video shares the same title as the blog post, but instead of Dion speaking, it’s actually just a computer voiceover, saying, ""I can’t even look at an American flag anymore, I hate this country.""
Right after the ""quote,"" however, the voice-over contradicts the previous statement. It says that Dion is one of the most talented vocalists that ""ever existed."" And although she is from Canada, her performance of God Bless America proves her ""true appreciation of our amazing country.""",0,Bloggers
"Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made ""zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS."" Night one of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia had barely ended when the Republican National Committee sent a blast email to reporters attacking the Democrats for ignoring the threat of terrorism when speaking at the podium.
""61: Number Of Speeches At The DNC Tonight,"" the Republican National Committee wrote. ""0: Mentions Of The Global Terrorist Threat Posed By ISIS.""
Was the Democratic discussion of ISIS and Islamic terrorism that thin? Basically, yes.
It’s worth noting that the first night was not intended to have a specific focus on foreign policy,  leaving the Democrats with three days left to discuss the issue. And Hillary Clinton -- away from the podium in Philadelphia -- issued a fairly muscular call for action against ISIS at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, N.C.
""We have to protect ourselves against terrorists,"" Clinton told the group. ""To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn’t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own. That won’t keep us safe.""
That said, as it concerns the convention in Philadelphia, the RNC’s statement is literally correct. Based on our searches of C-SPAN closed-captioning text, Congressional Quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services, we couldn’t find any speaker who mentioned ""ISIS,"" ""Islamic"" ""terror,"" ""terrorist,"" or ""terrorism"" during the first day of the convention.
The closest example came in a video that quoted Hillary Clinton’s speech after the mass shooting in Orlando in which a gunman who professed allegiance to ISIS attacked a gay nightclub.
""From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate,"" she said .
But that doesn’t really fit the description in the RNC’s email, since the email referred to speeches at the Democratic convention, not to video footage shown of Clinton’s past speeches.",1,Republican National Committee
"""When he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax, (McCain) said, 'I could.' But today he's attacking me for holding the very same position."" What politicians have said on TV often comes back to haunt them.
Sen. John McCain knows that feeling after Sen. Barack Obama recalled a past statement McCain made about Social Security solvency on a Sunday morning news show.
In a June 13, 2008, speech to senior citizens in Columbus, Ohio, Obama outlined his plan to require those earning $250,000 or more to contribute more in payroll taxes while keeping all other tax levels constant.
Then Obama dropped this line:
""There was a time when John McCain thought this wasn't such a bad idea. When he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax, he said, 'I could.' But today he's attacking me for holding the very same position.""
McCain never put specific salary parameters to the issue, but he did tell Tim Russert on a Feb. 20, 2005, edition of   Meet the Press  that he would consider increasing the Social Security payroll tax to help keep the system solvent.
Here's the relevant material from the transcript:
Russert: Sen. McCain, there's a big debate in your Republican Party about whether or not, as part of the solution to Social Security's solvency problem, that you lift the cap so that you would pay payroll tax, Social Security tax, not just on the first $90,000 of your income, but perhaps even higher. Could you support that as part of a compromise?
Sen McCain: As part of a compromise I could, and other sacrifices, because we all know that it doesn't add up until we make some very serious and fundamental changes.  (At the time, the cap stood at $90,000. In January 2008, it rose to the current level of $102,000.)
Reacting to Obama's assertion, McCain's advisers told reporters in a June 2008 conference call that he would not ""under any imaginable circumstance"" consider raising the payroll tax. During the conference call, campaign advisers didn't address McCain's 2005 statement on   Meet the Press.
Neither McCain's campaign nor the Obama camp returned calls seeking more information.
But the record is clear in verifying Obama's statement. We rule it True.",1,Barack Obama

""Singer Tina Turner: This Thanksgiving is the first time in 8 years that I am thankful for our president, God bless him and his supporters,"" stated the headline in dailynewsforamericans.com Nov 23.
We found the story after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We searched Nexis and Google and found no evidence that Turner made such a statement.
The website dailynewsforamericans.com is largely about famous entertainers reacting to Trump. We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website, which calls itself a ""tested and trustworthy team"" but posts fake news.
The article only contains a headline and a link to an interview with Turner on the show of British talk show host Jonathan Ross in October.
Turner didn’t mention Trump at all during the interview.

Smith and Geraldo Rivera did discuss the issue during a panel on Fox News on April 12. But beyond the initial quotes about Rivera hating airlines and Smith suggesting United faced too much regulation, the story is completely made up.
According to the story, Smith began ranting about how airlines were over-regulated and how Dao’s East Asian racial background rightfully made other passengers nervous in a post-Sept. 11 world.
""That goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American,"" Smith was falsely quoted as saying.

"""Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense."" During a recent appearance on The Daily Show , guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance.
Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance.
Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics,  ""85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people.""
In this fact-check, we’ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we’ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year.
Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage.
When the Kaiser Family Foundation’s June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn’t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn’t offer health insurance.
These two reasons aren’t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn’t face a cost obstacle is ""doesn’t need insurance,"" which was the answer of only 11 percent.
In another survey, the 2011 National Health Interview Survey , conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, ""Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don’t have health insurance?’’ Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason.
In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn’t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited ""other,"" which included ""didn’t want or need coverage,"" among other answers.
""The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen. Paul is right about that,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. ""People without access to employer-sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own, and that accounts for most of the uninsured.""",1,Rand Paul
"""Jefferson Davis statue to be replaced with Obama likeness."" A website masquerading as a Fox News Channel page ran a fake news story saying officials in New Orleans are replacing a memorial to the leader of the Confederacy with a statue of former U.S. President Barack Obama.

This particular post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, part of the social media site’s efforts to battle fabricated stories in news feeds.
The story built on a real news story from NPR about the Big Easy replacing Confederate icons around the city. This particular account is from May 11 , recounting how work crews had to remove the Davis statue in the middle of the night after ""death threats against city officials and contractors.""
The TDAlliance.com post used bits and pieces from that real story, then added fake news that an Obama statue will take Davis’ place.
""The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisiana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars,"" the story read. It also added that the Davis monument would be ""melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.""
Looking at the crude composite image plastered on the story, we saw a familiar sight: A real bronze statue of Obama installed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, back in 2012 . When last we saw this statue, it was erroneously cited as being erected in the White House ( read here for more about that contrived tale ).
TDAlliance.com appears to alter existing news stories, or make subtle changes to comments from officials in myriad posts. The site’s registration does not denote the administrator . We attempted to reach the site through its Contact Us form, but did not receive a response.

A false story claims that a Clinton email shows she ordered the war in Syria in order to benefit Israel.
""Clinton Email: We must destroy Syria for Israel,"" read the headline on Your News Wire, a hoax website.
The post says it was published about a year ago, despite its re-emergence on social media. We wanted to look into the claim.
The article cites a message leaked by Wikileaks from when Clinton was secretary of state.
""The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming that ‘the best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.""
But Clinton did not write the message in the email.
The message is a 2012 forwarded document from former diplomat James P. Rubin offering guidance on handling the situation in Syria. Clinton forwarded the message to an aide, asking him to print it out.
Rubin’s email to Clinton says she may not agree with his proposal, in which he argues that a more aggressive policy on Syria would eliminate the pressure on Israel to become involved, sparking a larger war in the Middle East.
Clinton’s actual policy proposals called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ""safe zones"" on the ground for Syrian nationals. Her stance on Syria also included more airstrikes against the Islamic State.
Another piece of information that was left out of the article was the conclusion of the document. Rubin said taking stronger action in Syria could protect other civilians from the war raged by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Israel’s hesitance to act was noted as a secondary victory.
The email attributed to Clinton in the Your News Wire story were not written by Clinton.",0,YourNewsWire.com

""Black men arrested in Philadelphia Starbucks settle for $2 million,"" said the headline of a May 2 post on The Rickey Smiley Morning Show’s website.
The show’s Twitter account on May 2 tweeted a link to the story with a similar caption about a $2 million settlement.
Facebook users flagged the website’s post as being potentially wrong. The original headline was. But the post has since been updated.
Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested April 12 at a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a business meeting. The two men were sitting at a table waiting for a friend, but had not made purchases. When they refused to leave, a store manager called the police and they were eventually escorted out in handcuffs, according to Philly.com . The incident was caught on video, prompting national news and allegations of racism.
The two men settled with the city for $1 each. Also, the city agreed to create a $200,000 fund to assist Philadelphia’s young entrepreneurs. A joint statement from Starbucks, Nelson and Robinson said they reached ""a confidential financial settlement as well as a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities.""
While the headline on the The Rickey Smiley Morning Show incorrectly said the men had settled for $2 million, the story itself accurately represented the outcome .
""Instead of a long and drawn-out legal battle, the men at the center of the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest incident have taken an incredibly low settlement from the city with a perk that speaks to their interests,"" the post said. ""Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.""

Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station.
This didn’t happen, of course, because the story is fake. It turned up on a few other websites around May 6.
But it actually originated on May 5 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately tried to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts.
The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake -- this Malia Obama post is just the latest example.
A previous story from TheLastLineOfDefense.org said Malia Obama had been expelled from Harvard University for smoking marijuana in Boston , despite the fact that she hadn’t even been enrolled at the school.
As for the fake accomplices pictured in the story, the image is taken from a series of mugshots showing a group of eight men arrested in Florence County, S.C., in 2013 for running a dogfighting ring. Malia’s image was inserted to suggest she’d been partying with the other seven.

""Electoral College elector commits suicide to avoid voting for Donald Trump,"" read a Dec. 19, 2016, headline on UniversePolitics.com . It appeared the same day members of the Electoral College voted to officially elect Trump the 45th president.

Nothing about the story or its extreme premise is accurate.
For starters, we found no evidence of an elector named Jeremy Hashville, in Michigan or any other state.
While there had been a lot of talk about electors potentially switching their votes to deny Trump the 270 needed to win the Electoral College, little came of it. Only two Republican electors, from Texas , changed their votes to avoid choosing Trump (another Texan elector had resigned and was replaced). No electors nationwide committed suicide.
Michigan electors said prior to the vote that they were not going to attempt to flip , but they couldn’t have even if they had wanted to do so. Electors in Michigan are bound by state law to vote for the winner of the state’s presidential election. If they don’t, they will be replaced with someone who will.
A photo included with the story said it was of Hashville, but was actually an Associated Press image of Washington state Democratic elector Bret Chiafalo. He was part of an effort called the Hamilton Electors — members of the Electoral College who hoped to flip enough Republican electors to deny Trump the presidency. (Their effort clearly failed.)
There’s nothing on the UniversePolitics.com site to indicate the story was fake, but it did include a source link to another site called WorldNewsDailyReport.com. The same story and photo appeared on that site , which says in a disclaimer that the posts on the site are ""entirely fictional.""
We attempted to contact both websites but did not get a response from either.

"""FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!"" A satirical story that said every American who voted for Donald Trump works for the Russian government appeared to have started as a parody on a neo-Nazi website.
""FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!"" read the headline on a May 15, 2017, post on USPoliticsInfo.com . The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news.
The story is full of absurd details that make it obvious it’s a joke. It said that anonymous FBI sources had revealed the 62 million voters were employed by Russian intelligence (Trump garnered more than 62.9 million votes in the presidential election, almost 2.9 million less than Hillary Clinton).
The story also said Wikileaks was run by Vladimir Putin and conservative media personality Alex Jones’ real name was Alexi Jonesov. An unnamed FBI agent further said in the article that ""it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box"" during the election.
The same story or portions of it also appeared on several other websites .
Most of the time, these fake news sites share the story without any attribution at all. But after some digging, we found that the original fake post came from the white supremacist website DailyStormer.com.
Dated March 28, 2017, the article carries the fake New York Times byline Yuri Rosenbaum. It falsely cited several real officials like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. The story also said Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., called for mass arrests and said Trump himself ""began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road"" when asked about the allegations.
We confirmed with DailyStormer.com publisher Andrew Anglin that his site, which occasionally posts satirical stories, was the source of the article. He said it should be obvious the story is not real, no matter where or in what form it appeared.
""My readership — and I hope to God the rest of the literate world — is intelligent enough to understand this is a joke,"" he said via email. ""I didn't know people were syndicating it without crediting me, but I don't really care.""

"""Robert Redford Says: Michelle And Barack Obama Should Get Five Years In Prison."" A story circulating on Facebook claims in a headline that actor Robert Redford thinks Michelle and Barack Obama should be sent to prison. But if you click, all you find is jibberish.
This story is a hoax.
""Robert Redford Says: Michelle And Barack Obama Should Get Five Years In Prison,"" reads the headline on newsdonaldtrumps.com. There is no story, however, to accompany the headline, just stray text about dental implants and tooth extractions.
The page also includes an image copied from an interview Redford gave to  Vanity Fair  in January 2016. The image does not include any mention of the Obamas, and neither does the full Vanity Fair article.
In reality, Obama awarded Redford the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2016 .
This particular hoax -- that an actor says Obama and/or his wife should be sent to prison -- appears to be a favorite of people who peddle misinformation.

"""Muslims’ disturbing plan comes out after grocery stores go bare to prepare for Irma."" A misleading headline from a website called Freedom Daily suggests that reports of potential food poisoning at grocery stores emerged after people stocked up in preparation for Hurricane Irma.
""BREAKING: Muslims’ Disturbing Plan Comes Out After Grocery Stores Go Bare To Prepare For Irma,"" said the headline of an undated post on Freedomdaily.com
Like a lot of fake news, the headline is extremely misleading while the text of the story itself is more accurate.
The article summarizes and adds its own commentary to reports from the media and other sources about the Islamic State’s poisoning of prisoners and about the group’s followers potential to also poison Western grocery stores.
In its About Us page, Freedom Daily said they ""post and decipher content to a level that is consistent with a common sense approach and falls in line with the ideals of American liberty and freedom."" Its Facebook page said the website ""gives Americans the real news as it unfolds with a conservative opinion.""
In its story, the website doesn’t make any claims about active plots discovered against American supermarkets.
""Multiple outlets have reported that ISIS is utilizing social media to instruct members to poison food in supermarkets. It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing,"" said the post about the grocery stores. ""People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege.""
SITE Intelligence Group reported on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting ""lone-wolf jihad in Western countries.""
Freedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 story on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE’s report. Newsweek also published a story Sept. 7 headlined, ""ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe."" But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma’s path across the Caribbean and Florida.
Freedom Daily’s story uses a photo of a woman in a blue blouse pushing a shopping cart past empty shelves in a grocery store. That photo was shot on Sept. 5 at a Publix supermarket in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. by the Palm Beach Post — two days after SITE’s report came out.
The Miami Herald and several other outlets also reported on Sept. 5 about empty shelves at stores as Floridians prepared for Hurricane Irma. The New York Times on Sept. 4 also noted there were bare water shelves in Puerto Rico as they also braced for the storm.
Freedom Daily’s story itself contains true information, but the headline ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",0,Freedom Daily
"""Georgia mosque keeps Hurricane Harvey donations, will send to Syrian refugees instead"" Pure fabrication lies behind a story flagged by Facebook users about a Georgia mosque sending Hurricane Harvey donations to Syrian refugees. A website called As American as Apple Pie posted this headline on Sept. 7: "" Georgia Mosque KEEPS Hurricane Harvey Donations, Will Send To Syrian Refugees Instead .""
The item cited Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton who allegedly said, ""Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter.""
There is not a whisper of truth to this piece.
For starters, there is no Peachton, Ga.
A website named Salatomatic lists mosques around the country. There is no Ramazala Mosque in Georgia.
The article urges readers to ""call the Ramazala Mosque at (330) 366-6476 and give them a piece of your mind."" The 330 area code covers Akron, Ohio. The number is the same number as the one listed on the As American as Apple Pie Facebook page .
That Facebook page describes the website as an entertainment website launched in 2024.

"""Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump’s legal team on it's last leg."" President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani quit, a headline would have readers believe, but the headline isn’t clear about which job Giuliani actually quit.
""Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump’s legal team on it's last leg,"" said a May 12 headline on The Political Voice , a website that includes many articles critical of Trump.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
' placeholder text in the ruling comments.
Giuliani, Trump’s attorney, has been in the news since he spoke to Fox News’ Sean Hannity on May 2 about money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Giuliani said that Trump had repaid Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to silence Daniels who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006.
While the clickbait headline by The Political Voice could create the impression that Giuliani resigned from Trump’s legal team, that’s not the case. The story said that Giuliani resigned from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig.
Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm’s New York office in April and then in May resigned to focus on his work as one of Trump’s personal lawyers on the Russia investigation.
Richard A. Rosenbaum, executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, confirmed in statements to the media that Giuliani resigned.
""After recognizing that this work is all-consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm,"" he said.
A headline said ""Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump’s legal team on it's last leg."" That headline creates the misleading and inaccurate impression that Giuliani quit Trump’s legal team. In reality, he quit the Greenberg Traurig law firm to devote more time to his work for Trump.",0,The Political Voice
"Says Democratic Senators ""demand Supreme Court nominee not be unduly influenced by U.S. Constitution."" A viral image circulating on Facebook wrongly credited three leading Democratic senators with made-up quotes lifted directly from a satire website. The image did not disclose that the quotes were satirical.
""Senate Democrats demand Supreme Court nominee not be unduly influenced by U.S. Constitution,"" the image said in bold yellow font. The image featured photos of Sens. Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, each with a quote attributed to them.
The quotes purported to portray the Democratic senators as more interested in pushing an agenda than abiding by constitutional laws.
""Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,"" Schumer is quoted saying. ""And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.""
The image also quoted Warren saying, ""We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws, not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.""
Finally, the image alleged that Booker said, ""We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do.""
Several readers sent us emails flagging the image and asking that we check it out, so we did. We discovered that each quote is entirely made-up.
As it turns out, the quotes can be traced to a June 29, 2018, article from the Babylon Bee, a website that describes itself as ""your trusted source for Christian news satire.""

"""United Airlines flight attendant slaps crying baby during flight."" A fake news website targeted United Airlines over recent bad publicity by concocting a bogus story that said a member of the flight crew abused an infant.
""United Airlines flight attendant slaps crying baby during flight,"" read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on Now8News.com, a known fake news site. Facebook users flagged the story as being possibly false, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news.
The post, which is fake, said the flight attendant on a flight from New York to Chicago had asked the parents of a 7-month-old boy several times to ""quiet that annoying a-- baby down.""
After four attempts, the attendant reportedly grabbed the child from its mother’s arms and slapped him in the face. The crew member had to be restrained and the plane made an emergency landing in Missouri.
If the date on the story sounds familiar, it’s the same day a doctor named David Dao was forcibly removed from a United flight for not giving up his seat to help transport United employees from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. The story ignited a firestorm of backlash on social media and beyond.
Since March, the airline has had a run of events that have cast it in a bad light. There was a furor over two teens denied a flight because they were wearing leggings . After the Dao incident, a scorpion stung a passenger on a flight from Houston to Calgary, Canada. Most recently, a couple from Salt Lake City alleged they were kicked off a plane for no justifiable reason on their way to a Costa Rican wedding and honeymoon.
The fictional post on Now8News.com no doubt was timed to capitalize on Dao’s removal, laying blame on United for yet another PR disaster — but this one never happened. Now8News.com is a fake site designed to resemble a legitimate TV station’s website.
There’s no indication on Now8News.com that it posts fabricated content, although its Facebook page notes that it publishes ""what the Main Stream Media won't tell you, and a little BS too.""
PunditFact has written about the site before, when it posted a fake story that said a Black Lives Matter supporter had killed 19 white women and hidden their mutilated bodies in a freezer.

"""Florida passes bill legalizing recreational use of marijuana."" An Internet hoax wrongly claims that Florida has become the next state to legalize recreational marijuana.
""Florida passes bill legalizing recreational use of marijuana"" read the headline on ABC News-US.com, a hoax site using the same logo as the real ABC News .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The article falsely claims that Florida lawmakers passed a bill to legalize medical and recreational marijuana in order to boost the economy and create jobs. It claims that the law will be in place before Easter, which is April 1.
The article included bogus quotes from Rep. Janet Cruz, a Democrat from Tampa, that the bill would stimulate the economy. Cruz is also quoted noting the economic advantages Colorado has after legalizing recreational marijuana.
Those quotes are made up. Karol Molinares, deputy communications director for the Florida House of Representatives’ Democratic Office, said Cruz never said those things.
And no marijuana law like this has passed.
In fact, the site also posted the same fake story about Wisconsin , even using the same quotes, only changing the names of state representatives.
Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment in 2016 allowing for the use of medical marijuana. Lawmakers produced a bill in 2017 to implement rules and regulations, according to the Associated Press.",0,ABC NEWS-US
"Says Johnny Depp died after being apprehended for threatening President Donald Trump’s life. A series of fake news posts that said actor Johnny Depp first threatened President Donald Trump’s life and then died after being caught by federal authorities is yet another fake news saga created by a well-known liberal troll.
A June 24, 2017, post on Snoopack.com that read ""Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service"" said that Depp had talked about assassinating Trump, leading to the actor being detained.
The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. Users also flagged a follow-up post on June 24 at WashingtonFeed.com that said Depp was in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during his interrogation.
There’s more to the entire saga, according to a number of posts that first appeared on June 22-23 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org.
The website said that Depp, who was taken into custody and held under the Patriot Act , later died from his heart malady , although not before recanting his faith in Islam on his deathbed.
None of this is real.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which created the stories, is run by Christopher Blair . Blair has told us before that he fabricates absurd news posts in an attempt to fool conservative readers with his fake news. His site’s About Us section noted that TheLastLineOfDefense.org ""is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth"" — but it isn’t.

Trey Gowdy’s fictional son being found dead , Tucker Carlson being assassinated in a car crash , Sarah Palin being run off the road and Ted Nugent faking his own death .
These contrived storylines, often barely keeping their own counterfeit details straight among the various posts, end up being passed around on other fake news websites, with no indication that they are made up.

Facebook users flagged the post as being fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This article about Rafieya Husain, the Miss Universe Guyana 2017 , is bogus and recycles previous similar phony stories about other beauty queens.
We found similar fake articles on the same website about Miss Figi and Miss United Continents and on other websites about Miss Namibia and Miss Universe Malta . None of the accounts are accurate.
One of the beauty queens, Miss Universe contestant Martha Fenech, told the  Times of Malta  that such a report can be harmful.
""People who know me immediately laughed it off, but several other contacted me to know if I'm okay,"" she said. ""Other 'girls' apparently were only happy to share the fake news item. This is a very serious accusation. It taints my name, it taints Malta's name.""
We searched Nexis for credible news accounts about Miss Universe and the Heathrow airport and cocaine and found an example of a real life pageant queen busted for cocaine -- but more than 30 years ago.
Heather Michelle Ross, who represented Bermuda in a Miss World contest, pleaded guilty in 1983 to smuggling cocaine the previous year.

""Starbucks just placed Trump’s photo on floor so every customer have to step on it,"" reads the headline on a Feb. 16, 2017, post on AMPosts.com. It shows three men opening a Starbucks door to reveal what appears to be Shepard Fairey-style images of Trump as the welcome mat (the site added an arrow to point it out).
The post redirects from a DepartedMedia.com address that Facebook flagged as potentially being made up, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to identify fake news. DepartedMedia.com is a site known for sharing fake news. The site is registered to an address in Chesterbrook, Pa .
The image has been doctored, with Trump’s photo added after the fact. It comes from a Twitter account called @TrumpThe45th , which is associated with the websites. The account tweeted out the photo the same day as the Internet post.
There has been a strong conservative backlash against the Seattle-based coffee purveyor recently, especially after the company announced it would hire 10,000 refugees over five years following Trump’s controversial travel ban. But despite being picked up by several other websites across the Internet , the image and its implications are a Trenta-sized fabrication.
The picture is of a Starbucks, all right, but it was taken in March 2014, when a THIRD Starbucks opened in Downtown Disney at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. Trump hadn’t even announced his presidential campaign at the time. There are no photos on the floor, of Trump or anyone else.
The original image came from a photo of a Starbucks opening in March 2014 at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Calif., as posted on InsideTheMagic.net.

""Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.""
The post is definitely fake. There has been no announcement that the former comedian Franken, D-Minn., is quitting after winning re-election in 2014. Otherwise he probably would have mentioned it during his recent NPR interview .
Breakingtop.world doesn’t have any contact information, but it does have a Facebook page titled "" Fake News Report ."" That’s quite a clue that this is made up.
The site referred to the source of its post as a June 14 version of the article on OurLandOfTheFree.com, another parody website with hidden registration information . OurLandOfTheFree.com says in its footer note that the site makes ""no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it's probably not."" It echoes the warning on its About Us page .
But if you noticed, the post referred to Franken as the Senate minority leader, which he isn’t. That role belongs to Democrat Chuck Schumer. The Breakingtop.world post even mentions ousting Schumer later in the text.
That detail is wrong because the entire article has essentially copied a May 23 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org that really was about Schumer.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org is a parody website run by liberal troll Christopher Blair . Blair’s goal is to publish fake stories with absurd narratives in an attempt to fool conservatives.

""The Archbishop and Mrs. Leah Tutu are in fact in good health and spirits at home in the Western Cape,"" the statement said.
The website nytimes-news.com (note: not the online home of The New York Times) claimed Tutu’s wife ""told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.""
The undated false claim was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post seemingly gained traction due to national and international media coverage of former first lady Barbara Bush’s funeral on April 21.
It’s not the first time fake news sites have claimed Tutu died. Another hoax about his death spread in September 2016 after a hospitalization. The former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to apartheid policies.

In addition to the quote in the headline, the post claims Porter also said, ""I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man.

The Associated Press described Porter in 2013 as having ""a penchant for bold statements."" He told NRA supporters before officially taking office that they were part of a ""culture war"" that was bigger than just gun rights. Porter was succeeded as NRA president in 2015 by Allan Cors.
The BlackInsuranceNews.com post was flagged by Facebook as possibly being fake as part of the social media company’s efforts to weed out fake stories in its news feeds.
The BlackInsuranceNews.com story was very popular on Facebook. It’s been shared more than 68,000 times since being posted Monday, according to Facebook.

It also says public assistance recipients will get an extra $25 in ""food stamps"" if they are participating in work programs or job training. (The USDA food assistance program has been called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since 2008.)
The clues are clear, however, that this is completely fake.
The first sentence of the story denigrates people on public assistance and illegal immigrants, and cites a statement from the ""White House Communication and Propaganda Office,"" which does not exist.
The post also includes made-up quotes allegedly from the president, hitting keywords from a wide range of Trump-friendly topics, including a wall on the Mexican border, borrowing money from the Chinese and imposing tariffs.

As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with ""five of his wives and many children"" collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account.
""Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,"" Snowden is allegedly quoted as saying. ""What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.""
We could find no evidence that Snowden, who leaked classified information about the federal government’s surveillance programs, has ever said such a thing about bin Laden. Snowden fled to Moscow to avoid espionage charges and has since given several interviews, but this post is fake.
Versions of the story have appeared on many other websites over the last several months . But it originated on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a parody website we’ve identified on our list of dubious news sources, way back on Aug. 25, 2015 .
The site’s disclaimer noted that ""WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.""
The site’s stories are fabricated. As far as we can tell, the Moscow Tribune is not even a real media outlet, although there are Twitter and Facebook accounts under that name that do share news stories (the paper in Moscow, Idaho, is called the Daily News ).
The version of the post on AntiNews.in also cited a Dec. 31, 2015, post on a site called NaijaPicks.com , which said it worked ""to keep you informed on what's going on in Nigeria, Africa and the world over."" The post also included real quotes from Snowden reported in The Guardian newspaper in 2013 .

"""NASA confirms Earth will experience 15 days of darkness In November 2017."" A long-lived claim that NASA is warning the planet will be covered in darkness for more than two straight weeks continued to live on across the Internet but is completely made up.
A June 2, 2017, post on NewsForMeToday.com said that the Earth will go dark later this year with the headline, ""NASA confirms Earth will experience 15 days of darkness In November 2017."" Facebook users flagged the article as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to identify fake news stories.
""NASA confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29,"" the post read. Specifically, the event ""will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.""
The post also quotes NASA administrator Charles Bolden as saying the so-called ""blackout event"" will raise the Earth’s temperature up to 8 degrees, but should have no lasting effects. ""This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter,"" Bolden is quoted. For the record, Bolden resigned on Jan. 20, 2017 .
There also was something in there about the alignment of Venus and Jupiter and a hydrogen explosion in space, but that doesn’t matter, because the story is a persistent Internet concoction that isn’t true.
The NewsForMeToday.com post doesn’t link to any official source, a sure warning sign of an unreliable news report, but does cite a Jan. 12, 2017, post on ReflectionofMind.org.
That site, in turn, links back to a now-defunct page on GlobalRevolutionNetwork.com, which the Internet Archive told us was originally dated Oct. 24, 2016 , and warned of the event happening in November of that year.
This unfounded rumor goes back to at least 2015 , and has been posted time and again . Dates and details may change (one version said a solar storm would darken the Earth for six days in December), but none of them were correct.
We couldn’t find any evidence of NASA making such an announcement, of course. We contacted NASA about the possibility an inky fortnight of celestial shenanigans, but didn’t immediately hear back.

"Says Kellyanne Conway said liberal women hate her because of her ""striking beauty and intellect."" The false assertion that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told an anonymous reporter that liberal women hate her for being smart and beautiful showed up on a website that made it especially confusing to identify it as fake news.
A undated post on LondonWebNews.com said Conway told a media member at a Washington luncheon that left-leaning females dislike Conway because of her ""striking beauty and intellect."" The post was published June 1, 2017, and updated June 13.
Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news, and this one does appear to be contrived.
The post didn’t name the reporter, media outlet or event, and only featured the partial quote allegedly from Conway. The article did say pundits attacked Conway for the comment. We couldn’t find any instance of a reliable media report that corroborated the story, or any pundit who reacted to it.
The post also said Conway drew criticism on social media, but good luck finding anything on this specific (fake) comment that doesn’t track back to LondonWebNews.com.
The site does not appear to be filled entirely with fictional stories, like some fake news websites. It looked to include posts taken from many places, including reliable news sources. One post, for example, was about the June 14, 2017, Grenfell Tower fire in London. This kind of mix would make it very difficult for a reader to be able to discern this particular item is fabricated.
The site’s disclaimer said only that the site made ""no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability"" of anything it posted. ""Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk,"" it warned.
We tried to contact LondonNewsWeb.com via the email address provided on the site but didn’t receive a response. There was no byline listed with the story.
We did reach a White House spokesman, who didn’t want to give an official comment about the post.
But there’s no proof Conway made this comment, either way. It looks as if the website (or its original source) made the story up entirely.",0,LondonWebNews.com
"""In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president."" There was a time decades ago when the New York Times praised the idea of a President Donald Trump, a viral story on Facebook said.
""This is amazing: In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president...They forgot...,"" said a July 9 headline by Bling News, a website with clickbait headlines that lacks original reporting.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
The story mischaracterizes what the New York Times magazine wrote about Trump in 1984 in an article headlined ""The expanding empire of Donald Trump.""
At the time Trump, was the 37-year-old owner of the New Jersey Generals, a franchise in the upstart United States Football League. He was also the owner of many other businesses and properties.
The Times wrote: ""Donald J. Trump is the man of the hour. Turn on the television or open a newspaper almost any day of the week and there he is, snatching some star form the National Football League, announcing some preposterously lavish project he wants to build. Public-relations firms call him, offering to handle his account for nothing, so that they might take credit for the torrential hoopla.""
Nothing in the article declared that Trump would be the best president. The article did include a line that Trump said he didn’t want to be president:
""He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers,"" the Times wrote. ""All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.""
Bling News drew its report from another website, 100percentfedup . That website posted this update and correction following an article by Factcheck.org :
""We like to think our readers can think subjectively and ‘get’ our nuanced titles once they read the article. We give you credit for understanding where we’re coming from. Factcheck.org has claimed that the New York Times didn’t say Trump would be our BEST president. To clarify, if you read the intro paragraph of the article we hope you’ll think subjectively and understand what we said about the article. We believe that the New York Times INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBED HOW TRUMP WOULD BE A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA, therefore, THE BEST PRESIDENT ‘FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA.’""
We found no contact information on Bling News’ website. The New York Times magazine story in 1984 didn’t say that Trump would be our best president; instead, it was an in-depth profile of Trump the businessman.",0,Bling News
"""Kim Jong Un dead: North Koreans calling Trump an assassin"" A report that Kim Jong Un is dead and that it was an American sniper who killed him is fake news, despite an alarming headline and short story posted on dailysidnews.com.
A July 6, 2017, post headlined, ""Kim Jong Un dead: North Koreans calling Trump an assassin,"" claims the North Korean leader died ""of an apparent high-powered gunshot wound to the head"" and that state media reports the ""bullet came from the sniper rifle of an American positioned more than a mile away.""
Though the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is secretive and the government controls information and the media , there have been no reports by international independent, official news organizations of Kim Jong Un’s death.
United Press International reported that according to state-run Korean Central News Agency, Kim Jong Un on July 8 — two days after dailysidnews.com’s post — visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to pay respects to his biological grandfather, who died July 8, 1994.
Dailysidnews.com claims that the report of Kim Jong Un’s death follows North Korea’s successful test of a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii.
""Trump promised swift and appropriate action. This seems to be it. Liberals will cry murder and say we don’t have the right just before they remind us of how many civilians died in Iraq when a president refused to use a single bullet to end Saddam Hussein and instead dragged us to war for a decade,"" the post said .
North Korea on July 4 reportedly launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and U.S. officials estimated its range of 3,400 miles was capable of hitting Alaska, CNN reported .
But the dailysidnews.com website raises a lot of questions about its own legitimacy. There’s no information in its "" About Us "" page; a "" Contact Us "" page lists phony information, including an invalid email address and a nonfunctional phone number.
The website’s "" Terms and Conditions "" page includes a line that says, ""By operating the Website, Daily Sid News does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.""
The same July 6 post also appears on thelastlineofdefense.org, a website that says everything it posts is ""a satirical work of fiction."" Variations of the story are posted on other sites, including ourlandofthefree.com, which says it makes ""no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not.""

DailyUSAUpdate.com, a known purveyor of bogus news stories, posted a story on May 20, 2017 , with the headline, ""Worse than Hitler! Trey Gowdy’s son found in a Dumpster in D.C.! Murders are being questioned!""
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The fake article said that Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy was found dead in a Washington dumpster.
Rife with misspellings and grammatical errors, the post said the boy had disappeared from the Capitol building and was found in the trash receptacle at a Trump-owned hotel, possibly in an attempt to frame the president. It said two suspects named Hamil Lalahafa and Sanjay Gemtrapa were being questioned.
There was no contact information listed on DailyUSAUpdate.com. The fabrication has been published in various forms on other websites, too . None of them seem very concerned with the fact that Gowdy’s two children are named Abigail and Watson . There also are no mainstream news accounts of anything happening to the chairman of the House Benghazi committee’s kids.
The story first appeared May 20 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a well-known purveyor of fabricated news stories. The site’s goal is to goad conservative readers into believing fake posts in an attempt to illustrate their gullibility.
""We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist,"" the site’s About Us disclaimer reads. ""Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality.""

"""3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes."" A story that fishermen caught a 3,000-pound white shark in Lake Michigan is fake news.
NotAllowedTo.com ran a post on June 22 that said a Canadian tourist and his friend from Chicago had caught a shark responsible for the deaths of 100 people who went missing over the past decade. The catch and deaths are fabricated.
The story is a shorter version of a June 20, 2016, post published on World News Daily Report, a satirical news site.
""We’ve heard a few times about this story, and there's no fact to it,"" said Christopher Yaw, a spokesperson for the District Nine Coast Guard.
Great white sharks can’t swim in freshwater, as it dilutes their internal salt levels. That dehydrates them and decreases their buoyancy, so that they sink.
The story quotes a biology professor at the University of Illinois on the rarity of the find, but a search of his name on the university’s database yielded no results.
The post claims there was a 1916 shark attack in Lake Eerie that led to a 14 year swimming ban, but we found no traces of this attack or a ban. The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water.
We also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake.

"""Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives."" A clickbait headline on Facebook falsely claimed CNN’s Anthony Bourdain was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. This is an unsubstantiated, ridiculous allegation by conspiracy theorists who have tried to link the Clintons to criminal activity for years.
""Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives,"" said a June 10, 2018, headline from YourNewsWire.com, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online. The report cited a similar article from News Media Central, an ""alternative media"" site that considers itself ""free from establishment influence,"" according to its about page.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
YourNewsWire.com’s story said Bourdain, who died June 8, 2018, ""had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead"" and added that ""investigators"" were looking into the matter. As evidence of a link between Bourdain’s death and the Clintons, the report pointed to two tweets from Bourdain.
The first tweet , posted Oct. 11, 2017, criticized Hillary Clinton over an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria during which she said she was ""appalled"" to discover that there was ""a different side"" to her longtime donor Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who was accused by several women — including Bourdain’s girlfriend, Asia Argento — of sexual assault. Bourdain called Clinton’s response ""uninspiring,"" and many Clinton supporters responded on Twitter, including former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon .
In the second tweet , sent May 2, 2018, Bourdain said he was ""in no way (a Hillary Clinton) fan"" and that he had ""been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath"" before. The Twitter thread started when Bourdain shared a Rolling Store story about Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen, writing, ""The glorious career of ‘Fast’ Mikey Cohen. Nothing to see here, folks. Totally legit.""
The YourNewsWire.com report suggested that these tweets show the Clintons as likely responsible for Bourdain’s death.
The YourNewsWire.com report, like other Clinton-related conspiracies before it, crumbles under the microscope. The story’s only sources are alleged investigators — all unnamed — who were said to be looking into Bourdain’s death and also whether he had been planning to air an exposé of a pedophile ring, a separate claim that Snopes already debunked .
Sean Adl-Tabatabai, editor-in chief at YourNewsWire.com and author of the false report, told us the investigators referenced were ""online sleuths who dug up Anthony’s tweets and joined the dots."" He also pointed again to Bourdain’s May tweet as proof of the Clintons’ involvement.
We found no evidence that the Clintons played any role in Bourdain’s death. Bourdain died by suicide and was found unresponsive in his hotel room by a close friend, CNN reported .",0,YourNewsWire.com
"""Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days."" A fake news story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan announced President Donald Trump’s resignation is actually the brainchild of one of the Internet’s most prolific hoax authors.
The headline on a June 29, 2017, article on StGeorgeGazette.com read, ""Paul Ryan: ‘Donald Trump plans to resign from office within the next 30 days’."" Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
""Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,"" the post quoted Ryan. ""Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.""
Now, it’s obvious that Ryan hasn’t announced Trump is resigning. But other clues also show that the story is bogus.
There is no media outlet called the St. George Gazette. The website implies it is based in St. George, Utah , but the newspaper there is called the Spectrum .
The story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories.
Horner, formerly a writer at fake news site NationalReport.net, is credited with writing stories ranging from Bill Murray running for president to President Barack Obama opening a Muslim museum to Banksy getting arrested. You can read a roundup of some his work at NewsExaminer.net, which also is a fake news site.
Among his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to ""Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin"" and a plea to donate socks to the homeless.
The footer note posted on the bottom of the website lists a ""complaint department"" phone number that is actually the number for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan . It’s another Horner staple to use that number: The Ryan article cites the same number as a hotline set up by the White House for people to comment on Trump’s resignation.
There’s otherwise no contact information for the website. We reached out to Horner, who responded to us with a cheeky reply on Facebook, but did not address this particular story.

"Say first grandma Marian Robinson will get a $160,000 annual pension for life when President Barack Obama leaves office. With President Barack Obama and his family soon vacating the White House, several websites continue to spread a fake news story that says ""first grandma"" Marian Robinson will be getting a $160,000 annual pension after they move out.
Bloggers on the websites USPostman.com and ENHLive.com both posted undated articles that said Robinson will get paid the money for ""services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver,"" meaning she watched granddaughters Sasha and Malia Obama. Facebook flagged the stories as part of its efforts to combat fake news.
These stories lambast the Obamas for allegedly abusing their power and wasting taxpayer money by taking advantage of the pension. But there is no pension for the first grandma — the story is fake, and originated on a website known for trafficking in fabricated news.
Robinson, a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to First Lady Michelle Obama and her brother Craig, doesn’t qualify for any kind of pension, because she’s never been a federal employee. She did move into the White House in 2009 , and has helped raise her granddaughters . But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that.
There was no contact information for USPostman.com, and we received no response from ENHLive when we attempted to contact that site. But both articles mention elements found in an Oct. 17, 2016, article posted on the faux news site BostonTribune.com.
That fake story said that an unspecified Freedom of Information Act request provided documentation that Robinson would be getting the lifetime payment. There’s no indication of what the request showed, or how they arrived at the $160,000 figure.
The story also said she likely qualified under the Civil Service Retirement Act. That is a benefits program for federal employees that our colleagues at FactCheck.org note is only for workers who started service before 1987 . It has since been replaced by the Federal Employees Retirement System.
The false article makes oblique reference to the Former Presidents Act , which provides an annual pension for chief executives (plus Secret Service protection and some travel and transition expenses) after they leave office. For 2016 the pay level was $205,700 , unless the former president holds an appointed or elected office in the federal government.
And while presidential widows can qualify for $20,000 annual payments should their husbands die, there are no provisions to pay pensions to any other member of a former president’s family.
The BostonTribune.com website doesn’t appear to be working as of this writing. It was run by Associated Media Coverage, another website that also ran fake news, including one about several states enacting a two-pet limit that we rated Pants On Fire! in the past.

"The ""moon has more than 250 million citizens."" A online hoax claims, entirely without evidence, that 250 million inhabitants currently live on, or inside, the moon.
The headline, from a website called Mysterious Earth, states ""CIA Release Documents Of Moon, Moon Has More Than 250 Million Citizens."" But the article makes no reference to released CIA documents, and provides not a shred of proof to back up the claim that a civilization roughly the size of Pakistan’s population lives on the moon.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The article opens with a mangled quote misattributed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein: ""Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance."" (As the sleuths at metabunk.org point out, the real quote appears to trace back to 18th century British theologian William Paley, who criticized formulating contempt without investigation.)
Next, the item suggests that the very fact that it’s conceivable that hundreds of millions of inhabitants live on the moon — no matter how improbable — gives credence to the argument that a substantial lunar civilization already exists. (This argument, which takes the logical form of ""X is possible, therefore X is true,"" is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to possibility .) Yet in the very next breath the author doubles back, acknowledging ""this may not be true.""
The item then cycles through a host of fringe theories, including the Spaceship Moon hypothesis (also known as the Hollow Moon hypothesis). This idea, put forth in 1970 by two members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, holds that the moon is actually a hollow spaceship built by aliens.
This theory has been roundly debunked by planetary scientists.
Dr. Renee Weber, who manages the Heliophysics and Planetary Science Division at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, said in a 2011 interview that none of NASA’s findings support the Hollow Moon theory.
Karen Masters, an associate professor in astronomy and astrophysics at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in England, also addressed the fringe theory in a 2015 online forum hosted by Cornell University.
""The Moon is not hollow,"" Masters said. ""It is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the Moon, how they orbit in the Moon's gravity tells us about the mass of the Moon. We also know the size of the Moon so we can work out the density and see that it is not possible for the Moon to be hollow.""

Facebook said this particular post had been shared more than 178,000 times in the past year. We found other instances of the same story elsewhere, too .
The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China.
An official-sounding statement from the FDA warned that the rat meat coming into the United States was filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the National Football League’s main event.
The story warned that Americans should be vigilant about what they are eating, because it’s supposedly hard to tell the difference between rat meat and chicken wings. We’d think the substitution would be easy to spot, but apparently rat is most often caught masquerading as lamb .
And while some east Asian cultures have been known to consume rat meat or pass it off as something else , we could find no reports of rodent flesh being impounded in San Francisco by the ton in 2016, 2017 or any other year.
The UrbanImageMagazine.com post cited as its source a Feb. 6, 2016, story from WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake articles. The site admits as much in its disclaimer , referring to ""the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.""

"""Biden preparing 2020 presidential bid -- with Obama as vice president."" Rumors have spread suggesting that Joe Biden is not only running for a 2020 presidential bid, but he is planning to do so alongside former president Barack Obama as vice president.
""Biden preparing 2020 presidential bid - with Obama as vice president,"" read the headline on March 15, 2018, on Your News Wire, a hoax website claiming to ""cover the headlines the mainstream outlets shy away from"" on its Facebook page .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
Earlier this month, PolitiFact debunked that Biden has confirmed that he is running for president in 2020.
The latest story begins by citing a real Politico story regarding Biden’s proposals on how to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Despite the fact that the Politico article stated, ""Biden hasn’t been actively exploring the presidential options himself, and is far from making any decision about whether he’ll run,"" the Your News Wire article writes that it says that Biden is preparing for his campaign announcement.
There is no evidence that is happening.
The hoax goes on to say that Biden has chosen Obama -- whom he used to serve under as vice president -- to be his running mate. The story claims that it would be legal under constitutional law for the two to run together, but two-term presidents have traditionally taken an unspoken vow to retire from public life.
The 22nd Amendment prohibits a president from being elected for more than two terms, but it does not explicitly mention a former president being elected as vice president. However, the 12th Amendment states that ""no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.""
The unspoken vow two-term presidents take is also exaggerated. There is no obligation for a two-term president to stay out of public life. Since he left office, Obama has given public speeches at universities and is working on new books.
The article goes on to quote two different real stories from the Hill newspaper, but it only provides a link to one changing the context of the quotes given in different stories regarding speculation of Biden’s bid.
Quotes from Biden’s aides about Biden and Obama reclaiming the White House were also made up. When searching for these quotes, the only results we found came from the Your News Wire story.",0,YourNewsWire.com

""Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10,000 in fines.""
It isn’t obvious from the headline, but the article was published by a website that warns readers it is a satirical publication.
Here’s how fake it is: There is no Mary Lynne Davies who has accused Moore. Nine women have come forward and there’s not a Davies among them.
On top of that, the Alabama Attorney General is Steve Marshall, not John Simmons.
The only thing the item got right is that falsification is a misdemeanor under the Alabama State Legal Code.

"Says ""FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee."" Fake news bloggers have seized on the mass shooting at a Texas church, which killed 26 and injured 20 others, to spread disinformation about the shooter’s identity and motive.
Freedumjunkshun.com, a self-avowed fake news website, portrayed the perpetrator as a desperate Democratic activist whose killing spree at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, was motivated by atheism.
""FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee,"" the article claimed.
The fake news article missed basic facts and fabricated others. It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.
Some media reports quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist.
But the fake news article’s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a ""domestic situation.""
""There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him,"" Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting ""wasn't over religious beliefs.""
The fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as ""a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea"" who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter ""was on the DNC payroll,"" in reference to the Democratic National Committee.
""That’s completely false,"" DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told PolitiFact of the alleged connection.

""Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.""

"""Babysitter on crystal meth eats 3-month-old baby."" An odious fake news story claiming that a 16-year-old Missouri girl smoked crystal meth and attempted to eat the toddler she was babysitting is yet another example of a half-baked Internet post that has tricked readers into thinking it’s real.
This one is disturbing enough that we want to start by reiterating that it is fake, just so there is no confusion.
The headline on a Feb. 28, 2017, post on NotAllowedTo.com claimed ""Babysitter on crystal meth eats 3-month-old baby."" The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially contrived as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake stories in news feeds.
This post and others similar to it have been shared on Facebook thousands of times.
The story said a 16-year-old named Anna Ritchie smoked the drug and drank alcohol while watching a child, then told police she ate some chicken wings and passed out. The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy’s arms and legs.
So even in the context of the post, he didn’t really get eaten. If it’s any comfort, not only is the story fake, it also said the boy was expected to recover.
The photo included on most of the posts is not a ravenous, drug-smoking teenager from Missouri. It’s actually of a 28-year-old Indiana woman arrested in January 2016 on domestic battery charges.
The true source of this story is a Jan. 20, 2016, article on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting fake articles. (That version said the babysitter’s name was Anna Krutchiev.) The site says in its disclaimer that it is responsible for ""the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.""
There is no indication on the post we checked, or on most of the others reblogging the same fake story, that it's fabricated. Comments on these stories make it clear some horrified readers were tricked.
But this story about a babysitter getting high and attempting to eat a child never happened.",0,Bloggers
"""Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign."" Fake news reports said without evidence that celebrities threatened to go on strike unless President Donald Trump quit.
""Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign,"" said a Dec. 30 headline on Nourtey.com, a fake news website that attacks Democrats.
The story suggested Rosie O’Donnell was among the celebrities threatening to go on strike.
Facebook users flagged the Nourtey.com post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year.
Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on therightists.com that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign.
Snopes found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the  New York Times  by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O’Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to ""create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society."" Thousands of people , including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017.
The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump’s resignation.
O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a ""severe depression"" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends ""90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards"" Trump.
The pair have bad blood going back to O’Donnell’s time on ABC’s The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing.
We messaged O’Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: ""Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie.""
So Nourtey.com said, ""Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign."" While O’Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump’s inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.",0,Nourtey
"""Celine Dion’s 16-year-old Rene-Charles Angelil’s was among the 58 victims who were killed"" in Las Vegas. René-Charles Angélil, Celine Dion’s son, was not one of the people killed in the Las Vegas shooting, despite a fake news article that says he was.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com posted an article claiming that ""Celine Dion’s 16-year-old Rene-Charles Angelil’s was among the 58 victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire late Sunday at a Las Vegas concert that left at least 58 people dead and 515 injured.""
There is no indication that Angélil was even at the country music concert, let alone murdered there.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed to Dion a statement that it said she made on Oct. 2 about her son’s death: ""At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. René-Charles was the most kind-hearted, loving son I have ever seen.""
However, Dion never said this. Instead, Heather Gulish Melton said it in a statement made to radio station WCYB about her husband, Sonny. Sonny and Heather Melton attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival together. There, Sonny was shot and killed as they were running away from the shooter at the concert.
""At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his,"" said Heather Gulish Melton.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com changed the quote by switching the names from ""Sonny"" to ""René,"" altering the last part of the quote from ""loving man I have ever met,"" to ""loving son I have ever seen,"" and eliminating all together ""he saved my life and lost his.""
Often, fake news sites use site names that are close to the name of an existing news publication to trick people into thinking it is legitimate. For example, HoustonChronicle-tv.com is similar in name to the Houston Chronicle , which is the actual local newspaper for Houston, Texas.
Dion had a concert in Las Vegas on Oct. 3 where she paid tribute to the victims, their families, first responders and anyone affected by the tragedy.
""I never start the show like this but tonight is very different,"" she said, according to People . ""On Sunday we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls, and so many are still suffering,. But tonight we’re going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss.""
She made no mention of her son, because he was not a victim of this mass shooting.

"Says U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said, ""It’s better for our budget if cancer patients die more quickly."" A fake news story pegged to a real forum with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price falsely quotes him as saying it’s better for cancer patients to die than to waste taxpayer money.
""Tom Price: 'It's better for our budget if cancer patients die more quickly,' "" reads the headline on a March 16, 2017, post on USPOLN.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fake news, but it still has been shared on the site more than 75,000 times.
USPOLN.com is a site that we’ve written about in other fact-checks , and identifies itself as ""a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.""
Other than that, there’s no indication the story is almost entirely fabricated. The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo . The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email.
The story — which again, is fake — is actually from a March 16 post on Politicops.com, a different fake news site. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The Politicops.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an address in Israel .
What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know.
In this case, the disorienting details are compounded because the ""facts"" of the Politicops.com story are plagiarized directly from a news article on RawStory.com. That piece recounted an exchange about Medicaid between Price, who is a former GOP congressman from Georgia, and a man at a CNN town hall event .
Brian Kline, who said he voted for President Donald Trump, noted he was using Medicaid, the federal health program for the very poor, to be treated for cancer. Kline asked Price why he wanted to stop the expansion of Medicaid as outlined in the Affordable Care Act. Price said he considered the entire program to be riddled with problems. The back-and-forth illustrated that Price does want to draw back access to Medicaid.
The fake comments in the made-up story, however, echo a real accusation made in 2009 by former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat, during debate on the Affordable Care Act. Grayson admonished GOP opposition to the bill by saying on the House floor that ""If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.""
But Price did not use the words Politicops.com attributed to him by saying the budget would benefit more from cancer patients who gave up and died.",0,Bloggers
"""For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."" U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Lakeland, is one of a small group of Republicans calling for an end to the government shutdown.
After all, Republicans have succeeded in reining in government spending, Ross wrote in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times (the parent of PolitiFact), on Oct. 7, 2013 .
""In the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row,"" Ross wrote, adding, ""That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year.""
A reader asked us whether Ross was correct that, ""for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."" We thought the claim was interesting, and we decided to check it out.
By the most basic measure we found that Ross is right.
The Korean War was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953, so we counted starting in 1953.
Between 1953 and 1955, federal spending fell each year, from $76.1 billion to $70.9 billion to $68.4 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget . By 1956, spending had edged up again, to $70.6 billion.
After that, spending almost always went up every year, at least until recently. It fell for one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010.
But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. In 2011, federal outlays were $3.60 trillion. Outlays fell to $3.54 trillion in 2012, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the figure to fall to $3.46 trillion in 2013.
We should note that this is not the only way to measure a claim like this. Sometimes, raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, especially when talking about things that are growing. Inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. However, in this case, we think that using raw dollars is an acceptable measurement. That’s because reductions in spending mean swimming against the tide of inflation and growth.",1,Dennis Ross
"Says Whoopi Goldberg said the widow of a Navy SEAL was ""looking for attention."" A fake news story about Whoopi Goldberg allegedly condemning the widow of a slain Navy SEAL elicited such vitriol, the author says it led him to decide to stop posting on his website.
A March 1, 2017, post on UndergroundNewsReport.com said Goldberg excoriated Carryn Owens, the wife of William ""Ryan"" Owens, a SEAL killed during a Jan. 29 raid in Yemen . President Donald Trump pointed out Carryn Owens in the gallery during his speech before Congress on Feb. 28.
The UndergroundNewsReport.com article doesn’t mention the Owens family by name, but it does use a fabricated quote from Goldberg.
""She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight,"" Goldberg is quoted as saying. ""If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly grieving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me""
As part of its efforts to eliminate fake news in users’ news feeds, Facebook alerted us that the story might be made up — and it is.
The author of the story told PunditFact that every story on UndergroundNewsReport.com is bogus. James McDaniel, who told us that he is an American who lives in Costa Rica, said he made them up first as a joke, then used them to try and rile Trump supporters who believed the articles without verifying them.
The site contains a disclaimer that says all articles ""are fiction, and presumably fake news."" There currently is a link at the end of the story that redirects readers to an explanation that the website is trying to fool its readers.
As of this writing, the Goldberg story had 348 comments, and had been shared on Facebook well over 56,000 times. The same story has popped up on other sites that have copied it , with no indication that it is fake .
The entire experiment was never meant to be serious, McDaniel said, but he decided to quit posting new articles once he saw how far-reaching his fabrications had become online.
""I might have carried on a bit longer because I was having fun, but people took the Whoopi Goldberg story so seriously and it had gotten so big I thought I had better pull the plug,"" McDaniel wrote via email.",0,UndergroundNewsReport.com
"""Irish superstar Saoirse Ronan dies after on-set accident in St. Lucia."" Ladybird actress Saoirse Ronan is the victim of an Internet death hoax.
""BREAKING: Irish superstar Saoirse Ronan dies after on-set accident in St. Lucia,"" said  the headline from St. Lucian Times , a website with no ""about"" page or social media accounts.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The Irish-American actress is alive.
Aside from that major fact error, there are many other inaccurate points in this post.
The made-up story said that Ronan died following an on-set accident where she fell 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor while filming her new movie Mary Queen of Scots in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
But we found that the film was actually filmed in the United Kingdom , across various parts of England and Scotland, and not in St. Lucia.
The article fabricated quotes by British film producer and co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan , who is co-producing the film.
A coroner named Bradley Cyril is also quoted as saying Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall, passing away shortly after being placed on a ventilator.
We found a similar Beausejour Health Centre in Canada , but we did not find any facilities by the name of Beausejour Medical Center, and none in St. Lucia. Consequently, we couldn’t find anyone named Bradley Cyril who works as a known coroner.
Also mentioned in the story are supposed injuries suffered by actress Charlize Theron , the ""irreplaceable star"" for Mary Queen of Scots. Not only is Theron injury-free, she is not in the film. The film is also under the production companies Working Title Films and Focus Features, not Good Universe .",0,St. Lucia Times
"""I opposed this war from the beginning. I opposed the war in 2002.  I opposed the war in 2003.  I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006."" Obama opposed the war as a little-known state senator, and spoke out notably at a Chicago anti-war rally in 2002. In 2003, when he began campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat for Illinois, he reiterated his opposition in several debates and meetings.
In other words, Obama's sweeping claim to have long opposed Iraq is true.
Opponents have attacked Obama's record of opposition on two grounds. They argue that Obama should answer definitively how he would have voted if were in the Senate at the time of the vote. Obama said in 2004 he can't answer that question fully because he doesn't know what intelligence the senators had access to.
Opponents also have taken comments of his out of context to suggest he supported the war, particularly his 2004 statement that ""There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage."" But that quote is pulled from a story in which Obama expresses a sentiment that now that the war has started, the U.S. should do the best job it can to steer Iraq toward stability.
Obama joined the U.S. Senate in 2005. He has voted several times to continue funding for the war, saying that troops in Iraq should be funded even if he disagreed with the overall war. (The measure passed 97 to zero.)  In recent months, like other Democratic candidates, he has voted in favor of troop withdrawals and other measures to bring the war to a conclusion.",1,Barack Obama

Citing a Nov. 22, 2017, article from America Now, a blog site, the story said a Somali native drove her car off the road and into a house, injuring a man and killing his child in what was her second car accident in four days. The man was walking his son in a stroller.
""After 2 car accidents in 4 days, one of which injured a father and took the life of his 7-month old baby before the car drove into a house, a Somali native has been arrested, charged, and convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide and was then let free to roam around until her sentencing hearing,"" the story said, adding that the woman, Muhuba Mohamed of Columbus, Ohio, was driving on a temporary permit at the time of the accident.
But according to local reports from the  Columbus Dispatch  and others, Mohamed was not set free following the crash. After a judge found her guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide on Oct. 5, 2017, Mohamed surrendered her passport and remained free on bond while she awaited sentencing, which occurred Nov. 29, 2017.
Mohamed’s bond was set at $10,000, according to court records.
Judges often set criminal defendants free on bond as a means of securing their agreement to return to court for their remaining criminal proceedings. In this case, Mohamed returned to court for sentencing, where she received three years in prison and a lifetime license suspension.
So yes, Mohamed was able to ""roam around until her sentencing hearing,"" so to speak. But she surrendered her passport and was bound to return to court by a high bond.

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""Laura Loomer, a conservative investigative journalist, is charging ‘Auntie’ Maxine for assault, citing Waters hit her hand and swatted her face with office papers,"" the article reads.

Yesterday when I confronted her on Capitol Hill, she ASSAULTED me. She hit my hand, then she swatted me in the face twice w/ her papers. I’m pressing charges against her.""
A video Loomer posted of the incident shows Loomer chasing after Waters in the halls of Congress. Waters responds each question by saying a variation of, ""Come to my office, I’ll be happy to sit down with you. We can’t talk on the run.""
When Loomer does not desist, Waters holds a piece of paper over her face and waves Loomer’s recording device away. Waters eventually walks into a members-only elevator on her way to a vote.
Filing a police report does not equate having criminal charges brought against Waters. A criminal charge can only be made by a government authority, which Loomer is not.
""A police report could trigger a criminal charge if a prosecutor brought the charges to a grand jury and they chose to pursue it,"" Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, told us.

"""Rubio: ‘Rape victims should be in custody if there is suspicion that they’re planning abortion.’ "" Bloggers revived an 18-month-old fake news story that greatly distorts Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s position on abortion.
""Rubio: ‘Rape victims should be in custody if there is suspicion that they’re planning abortion,’ "" reads the headline on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. political news).
USPOLN.com, which describes itself as a ""hybrid news/satire platform,"" published the article May 23, 2017. But the story talks about a statement the Florida senator allegedly made at a New Hampshire town hall during his presidential campaign, which ended more than a year ago. As its source, USPOLN.com links to a Nov. 8, 2015, story on politicono.com , also a regular purveyor of fake news .
The article was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated.
The article drastically veers away from Rubio’s real position on abortion.
USPOLN.com made up this flippant, over-the-top quote and attributed it to Rubio: ""I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it. I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.""
Reporters and debate moderators asked Rubio about his position on abortion and rape victims on several occasions during his primary campaign. Rubio opposes rape and incest exemptions for abortion. He never said rape victims considering abortion should be jailed.
In fact, Rubio has cosponsored legislation that bans abortions but includes exemptions for victims of rape and incest. He said he does not support these exemptions but recognizes that they are necessary to get more support for the legislation.
""A rape is an act of violence,"" he told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd in August 2015. ""It's a horrifying thing that happens. And fortunately the number of abortions in this country that are due to rape are very small, less than 1 percent of the cases in the world. But they happen and they're horrifying and they're tragic, and I recognize that.""
He added, ""That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America.""
USPOLN.com’s about page includes a disclaimer, warning readers that its articles ""may not be reliable"" and that they should consider ""any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""

The story said Lindsay was released on $10 million bail and faced more than 70 years in prison just for the opium.
Except Lindsay isn’t in any trouble, because he doesn’t exist. New Jersey’s two senators are Democrats Cory Booker and Bob Menendez .
There also was no bust, because the story was made up and posted on June 10 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair, a fake news operator whom we have profiled in the past .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs fake news stories written by Blair in an attempt to fool conservative readers. These stories often are posted on other websites without attribution or indication they are fake.
The site’s disclaimer said that it ""is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.""
The story about the drug bust continued on Blair’s website, with the fictional Lindsay agreeing in a followup story also posted on June 10 to flip on his business partner, Lester Malroney. The saga telegraphed it’s contrived premise, calling Malroney ""an obviously fictitious name"" and suddenly referred to Lindsay as a senator from Wyoming, not just having a ranch in Wyoming (the state’s senators are actually Republicans Mike Enzi and John Barrasso ).
The fictitious saga led to the pretend senator's death and more, including implicating Chelsea Clinton and tying the DEA raid to a previous fake yarn about the Clinton Foundation smuggling contraband and refugees.

""Singer Miley Cyrus: ‘Trump fans are destroying my career, I can’t stand them and I decided to move to…’"" read the headline on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content.
The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to Billboard magazine in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters.
In the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments.
Cyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues. When searching for the quotes attributed to Cyrus, we found no results of the statements. Celebrity news fact-checking site Gossip Cop also confirmed that Cyrus never accused Trump supporters of hurting her album sales.
We did find an actual recent interview with  Wonderland Magazine  where Cyrus was featured on the cover. In that interview, she talked about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now.
Cyrus’s latest album, Younger Now, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the Billboard charts .
Even though last year Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she recently backtracked, calling it ""ignorant"" to leave the country because of the president.",0,Bloggers
"A photo shows ""Obama being dragged before a judge in handcuffs for wiretapping Trump."" A photograph in a fake news story purporting to show former President Barack Obama standing before a judge in handcuffs is a crude composite image made up by a joke site.
You’d think that would be obvious just by looking at the picture, but it’s not, judging by the thousands of times it was shared on social media.
""Breaking: Leaked picture of Obama being dragged before a judge in handcuffs for wiretapping Trump,"" reads the headline on several versions of the same Internet post on March 5, 2017 . Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fake, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to stamp out fake news on its website.
The stories are all essentially identical, saying authorities stopped Obama (wearing a fake moustache!) as he was trying to fly out of Toronto’s airport to an unspecified destination. He was allegedly taken back to Washington, where ""a court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart"" secretly took the photograph.
The photo ""shows"" Obama’s head clearly Photoshopped onto someone else’s body. That someone is actually Robert Halderman, a former CBS News producer who in 2009 was accused — and later convicted — of attempting to extort late-night TV host David Letterman.

"""Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday."" A death hoax has been circulating for months that actor Kirk Douglas died.
""Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday,"" stated a headline by Your Action News 3 which has circulated since December .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that the famous movie star had died.
The fake story said that Douglas died of natural causes and that his family released a statement saying he ""went comfortably and was in no pain"" and ""lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.""
In 2014, People magazine accidentally published the actor’s obituary on its website.
""DO NOT PUB Kirk Douglas Dies"" the headline read. The magazine removed the obit from it's website after reports about the premature obit circulated on social media. Many news organizations pre-write obits of famous people.
We searched for mainstream news reports about Douglas and found no reports that he had died. When Douglas turned 101 in December, the  Daily Gazette  in Schenectady, N.Y., where the actor’s sister lives quoted the actor’s niece Marilyn Gordon.
""Uncle Kirk is doing great,"" Gordon said. ""They're going to have a big party for him (Saturday).""
Douglas survived a helicopter crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996 .
""I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That’s shocked me, really. And it’s sad, too,"" he said in a 2017 interview .
We sent an email to Your Action News 3 and did not get a reply. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes have debunked other death hoaxes by the same website about Morgan Freeman , Bob Barker , and George Zimmerman .

"""The average family (is) now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago."" Economic stagnation is an issue that has become a major talking point for both parties.
Take President Barack Obama’s most recent State of the Union address, in which he said that during the past four years, ""average wages have barely budged."" We rated that claim True .
Now, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, has offered an even more ominous statistic for working Americans.
""The average family,"" he said in the March 8, 2014, weekly Republican address, is ""now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago.""
We wondered whether Portman’s claim was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau .
The bureau collects data on family income and found that Portman is correct as long as the dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation. We looked at both the mean family income (that is, total family income divided by the number of families) and the median family income (the middle value when all family incomes are lined up from biggest to smallest).
For the inflation-adjusted mean, family income fell from $87,312 in 2007 to $82,843 in 2012, the most recent year available. That’s a drop of $4,469, making Portman correct. In fact, he underestimated a bit.
The difference is even more stark if you use the inflation-adjusted median. By that measure, family income dropped from $67,943 to $62,241 over the same period. That’s a drop of $5,702 -- an 8.3 percent decline over five years.
So Portman’s only shortcoming is to lowball the size of the family-income decline.
We should note that choosing 2007 as the starting year maximizes the decline, since the last recession began in December 2007. But we have no quarrel with the use of this period, because when looking at income trends, it seems reasonable to look at how big an impact the recession has had.
We’ll also note that Portman wouldn’t be correct if non-inflation-adjusted figures are used. Without an inflation adjustment, both mean and median family incomes went up from 2007 to 2012 -- about 5 percent for mean family income, and 1.4 percent for median family income. But economists generally prefer inflation-adjusted data for situations like this, since the adjusted data takes into account the most important aspect of income -- what it can actually purchase.",1,Rob Portman
"""Trump on revamping the military: We’re bringing back the draft."" A fake news article that said then-candidate Donald Trump would reinstitute the military draft should he be elected president was actually posted on a parody site early in 2016.
An April 29, 2016 , article on the website RealNewsRightNow.com with the headline ""Trump on revamping the military: We’re bringing back the draft"" has enjoyed something of a resurgence on Facebook.
Users recently reported the story as possibly being fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The post includes bogus quotes of Trump at a campaign rally in Costa Mesa, Calif., telling a crowd that he wants to re-establish conscription, which ended in the United States in 1973.
""We’re bringing back the draft, OK? We’re going to bring it back, and we’re going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,"" he’s quoted. He also goes on to say ""was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops.""
Except Trump never said those things (although he was in Costa Mesa for a rally that day). RealNewsRightNow.com is a parody site attempting to write for comedic effect.
Their About Us page doesn’t carry any sort of disclaimer, but it’s apparent from the absurd biography written for alleged founder R. Hobbus J.D that the site is a joke.
Besides multiple Pulitzer Prizes and Nobel Peace Prize nominations, Hobbus apparently won the fictional Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity, for example. Glass was a notorious fabricator of scads of people and quotes in stories he wrote for The New Republic. He was exposed back in 1998, before we used the trendy term ""fake news.""
It’s also clear from the other stories on the site that the news is fake. More recent headlines included "" TSA to give complimentary massages to select travelers during security screenings "" and "" CNN report: 1 in 5 American voters spoke to Russian ambassador before U.S. election .""
We reached out to the site via its contact form but did not hear back. The site is registered through a hosting service with a Los Angeles address .
Trump has been criticized in the past for receiving five draft deferments from 1964 to 1968 . Four were educational deferments for attending college and one was a medical deferment for heel spurs. Some opponents labeled Trump a "" draft dodger .""
The goal of the story was obviously to play off this issue. For whatever reason, social media seemed to recently rediscover the story, which many must have thought was real.",0,RealNewsRightNow.com
"""Malia Obama expelled from Harvard."" A story that appeared on scads of blogs claiming former President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter Malia was kicked out of Harvard University is fake news.
""Breaking: Malia Obama expelled from Harvard,"" read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on TheNewYorkEvening.com, a known fake news website. The same post appears almost word for word on plenty of other websites , too .
Facebook users flagged the story as possibly being bogus, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds.
The post said Harvard chancellor Malcolm Little said Malia, 18, ""was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends."" The school’s strict drug policy meant she was out, the article read, and the Obama family was considering filing a discrimination suit.
Again, this story is fake, because there haven’t been any reports that Malia Obama was kicked out. But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult — she isn’t going to school there yet.
The White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would take a gap year before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like hang out with boys in Manhattan .
As for the post’s other details, Harvard does prohibit drugs and alcohol on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn’t have a chancellor, it has a president , and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust.
More importantly, the post originally appeared April 9 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
Point being, Malia wasn’t caught smoking weed in a Boston hotel, and didn’t get booted from a school she isn’t even attending yet. Don’t expect to see her having to settle for Brown anytime soon.",0,Bloggers
"""Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning."" In a video promo for the new season of MTV's Jersey  Shore, Snooki gets all, like, political.
""I don't go tanning-tanning anymore because Obama put  a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi says after her boyfriend  is shown spray-tanning her face. ""And I feel like he did that intentionally for  us.""
""McCain would  have never put a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" she said, adding, ""because he's  pale, so he'd probably want to be tan.""
McCain entered the discourse via Twitter :  ""Snooki, u r right, I would never tax your tanning bed! Pres Obama's tax/spend  policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen!""
We should hope so.  McCain has a history of battling skin cancer.
But let's get to the facts. Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent  tax on tanning? On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka  the health care bill) into law. And Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B makes this all very  clear: ""There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10  percent of the amount paid for such service.""
We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama  passing that provision specifically to stymie the Jersey Shore crew.
But it turns out that  the president had mentioned her by name on May 2, 2010, and said she'd be exempt:  ""This next provision is called the Jersey Shore-Up,"" Obama said. ""It reads: 'The  following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this  bill: Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.'""  (""The Situation"" and ""JWOWW"" are other members of the Jersey Shore cast.)
Alas, Obama's comment  was made during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner . In  other words, it was a joke.
(Yes, it scares us too that Obama and McCain are  so familiar with Jersey Shore.)
If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki, we  could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning. There's no fee on  sunshine, just indoor tanning. Or that it's Obama's tax. There's no indication  an indoor tanning tax was Obama's idea.
It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an  alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery. The cosmetic surgery lobby  (funded by plastic surgeons) apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning  lobby. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will  raise $2.7 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical  coverage. Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor  tanning, as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer. The bill  was passed by Congress, but Obama signed it, so we think Snooki's assigning the  tax to Obama is fair.
One other small point. The indoor tanning tax goes  into effect on July 1, 2010. So when Snooki made her comment, she still could've  gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sam's extra reach. But we're assuming Snooki isn't  so much worried about the money as the principle.",1,Snooki
"Obama says Clinton in 2002 suggested there was a connection between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government. Asked about a new report that found no connection between al-Qaida and the old Iraqi government before the U.S. invasion, Sen. Barack Obama said it shows that Sen. Hillary Clinton had poor judgment in 2002 when she repeated claims from the Bush administration to support its plan to go to war.
""President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection,"" Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's  Hardball  on March 11, 2008. ""I think it was part of a series of misjudgments that have not only cost us dearly in terms of lives lost and people who are injured, has distracted us from Afghanistan and our ability to pin down bin Laden and al-Qaida, but has also cost us hundreds of billions of dollars.""
Clinton's support of the war is well-known, but we wondered if Obama was quoting her correctly about al-Qaida. So we checked the transcript of a speech she gave on Oct. 10, 2002, just hours before the Senate voted to approve the war resolution.
In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning for supporting the war resolution. She described Saddam Hussein as ""a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people"" and said that he blocked weapons inspections in 1998.
""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001.""
In their book  Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,  Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. note that Clinton was rare among Democrats in citing the al-Qaida link. The book quotes Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as saying the links were ""much exaggerated,"" while Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California described them as ""tenuous.""
Gerth and Van Natta point out that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut came closest to echoing Clinton's comments, but even he said ""the relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam's regime is a subject of intense debate within the intelligence community.""
Clinton was asked to explain her al-Qaida remark during an appearance on  Meet the Press  on Sept. 23, 2007.
She sidestepped the part about al-Qaida but said, ""Well, I cast a sincere vote based on my assessment at the time, and I take responsibility for that vote. I also said on the floor that day that this was not a vote for pre-emptive war. I thought it made sense to put inspectors back in. As you recall, Saddam had driven out the U.N. inspectors in 1998 and the situation in Iraq was opaque, hard to determine, and I thought that it made sense to put inspectors back in.""
She put the blame on the Bush administration.
""Now, obviously, if I had known then what I know now about what the president would do with the authority that was given him, I would not have voted the way that I did.""",1,Barack Obama

A lot of weird things happen in Florida. This isn’t one of them. The story is fake.
""Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke',"" read the headline on an April 13, 2017, article on FloridaSunPost.com. The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected the story may be fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news.
The story said a Tampa man named Darren Winters ""had consumed a copious amount of alcohol"" when he decided to invite friends over to witness him use a contraption he dubbed a ""scuba bong.""
The recreational diver had planned to blow smoke into a scuba tank with a compressor, then inhale it through a regulator, the story read. Winters reportedly knocked the tank off a workbench and it exploded, with shrapnel severing his genitals.
While those details are graphic, they’re also completely fabricated. FloridaSunPost.com is a fake news website designed to look like a traditional news outlet.
The exact same story appeared on BostonLeader.com on Sept. 16, 2016 , with the location changed to Boston. The name of the victim was changed to Michael Fitzpatrick — although the surname Palmer was cited once, too.
Where did Palmer come from? Another version of the same story was posted on Sept. 3 at IsThatLegit.com, but this time in Calgary, Canada. The victim in that story was named Robert Palmer.

"Says former President Barack Obama ""will be on new $1 dollar bill."" A persistent, false claim running on numerous blogs says former President Barack Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill this year. The report is actually worthless.
""Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017,"" reads a headline on a Jan. 26, 2017, post on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers whether they supported the move .
The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news.
The false story, complete with the misspelling of ""Barack,"" appeared on several other websites in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs — in early 2016. That’s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated.
For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs ( including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman ) are in the works. The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing says there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill , because it’s seldom the target of counterfeiting.
There are also some legal roadblocks. The U.S. Treasury does not permit living people to be on currency notes , and Congress has prohibited a redesign of the single greenback in its omnibus spending measures . The vending machine lobby convinced lawmakers to leave the dollar alone , mostly because it would be expensive for vendors to upgrade bill readers to recognize cash sans Washington.
It’s hard to tell where the idea of Obama headlining the base unit of American currency originated, but contrived news stories about it go back to at least 2012.
Supermarket tabloid Weekly World News ran a story falsely saying the Obama administration had approved a new design for all bills , including a dollar featuring the 44th president that would be worth 47 cents. The story made reference to the Dollar ReDe$ign Project, a branding experiment going back to 2010 that solicited new currency designs . Other blogs reran the Weekly World News story as fact.
We found the version of the story currently in circulation on blogs going back to 2014 , with the same faux dollar illustration.
The United States Mint did strike a pair of bronze medals commemorating Obama’s two terms in office . You can buy replicas of both , but they are not legal tender. You also can buy several forms of joke bills featuring Obama from private online vendors, including denominations of $44 , $2,008 and even $1 million .
But Obama appearing on any real currency, like making it onto the United Federation of Britain’s $50 in the 2012 remake of Total Recall , will remain fictional for now.",0,Bloggers

Judging by the number of commenters asking to be signed up, there also is an audience for marijuana studies.
Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds.
""NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their ‘Rest Studies’ – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD,"" the post read. ""During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.""
There are more details on the post, but you get the gist. We found versions of the same story on several other blogs going back to at least March 2016 , all claiming NASA is doling out the big bucks for people who want to lounge all day and spark up. Pretty good hustle, right?
Except it’s not true.
Well, it’s true that NASA does perform bed rest studies . The goal is to examine the potential effects of weightlessness on astronauts, and lying in bed with your head tilted down at a six-degree angle is apparently a fair substitute.
The studies sound pretty much as described at TheSolExchange.com — except for the cannabis part. Several media outlets like the Houston Chronicle ,  Forbes , Vice and CBS News have written in the past about the studies, which involve people getting paid something on the order of $1,200 per week for 15 weeks (that’s $18,000) to hang out in bed.
But it’s not all that great of a time, from the sound of it. Boredom is a constant problem, as every moment of a volunteer’s life is spent in bed for that time. Scientists continually poke and prod them, taking readings and measurements on everything from weight to bone density. Volunteers are told when and what to eat, and have to do everything in bed. That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down.
A NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren’t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it’s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time.
Blog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.",0,Bloggers

The story has been reblogged by several other sites , and has regained popularity on Facebook following Pence’s address at the Jan. 27 March For Life in Washington . It was flagged by Facebook as part of the social media giant’s attempts to stamp out fake news on its site.
The post opens by saying Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, had signed a restrictive abortion bill. It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn’t have an exception for victims of rape because ""we’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.""
To be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny.
Politicot.com is part of the Newslo network of sites , which we’ve written about before , including one fake story about Pence calling Michelle Obama ""the most vulgar first lady we’ve ever had."" We rated that Pants On Fire !
The site describes itself as a ""hybrid News/Satire platform"" that focuses on ""entertainment."" The only indication that the stories might be fake is a ""Show Facts"" button that highlight what is true, leaving the reader to surmise that the rest of the story is contrived.
In this case, what Politicot.com deems as ""facts"" is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had ""recently"" signed a bill restricting abortions.
Pence did sign an abortion bill in March 2016 that prevented women from getting an abortion due to the race, gender, or disability of the fetus . Indiana already was one of the most restrictive states in the country for women seeking abortions.

The idea that Scott was going to suspend Israel has not been reported by other credible news outlets. We asked Scott’s office if he plans to suspend Israel, and a spokeswoman said that he will review the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation once it is complete.
Scott ordered that investigation into the law enforcement response in February following the Valentine’s Day shooting. Israel has faced scrutiny for his office’s response to the shooting, including the fact that the school resource officer, Scot Peterson, took position outside of the school rather than go in and engage the shooter. The department is months away from finalizing its investigation and then will submit it to the Broward state attorney for review, an FDLE spokeswoman said.
The governor has the power to suspend public officials for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony. Scott has largely suspended public officials who have been accused of crimes.
If Scott removes Israel, a Democrat, he could appoint a replacement in the Democratic-majority county . ( Scott , a Republican, is running against Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in the Nov. 6 election.)

"The Clinton Foundation is sending water to Houston ""for $7 a bottle."" It’s not true that the Clinton Foundation is providing water to Houston hurricane survivors at $7 per bottle. That’s fake news.
An Aug. 30 post on OurLandofTheFree.com claimed the foundation ""is using an outdated rule for non-profits"" that would allow it ""to compete in the free market regardless of who the competition is.’""
The headline says, ""Clinton Foundations (sic) sends water to Houston…for $7 a bottle.""
The post claims that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is under contract to pay for water and other items ""due to Obama era rules that give special consideration to ‘compassionate liberals’ who own non-profits."" The website also said the Clintons stand to funnel to themselves hundreds of millions of dollars that would come through the foundation for flood relief.
But posts on OurLandofTheFree.com should not be taken as serious reporting.
The website’s About Us page says, ""All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not. It’s not you, it’s me.""
The Clinton Foundation, founded by former President Bill Clinton, also refuted the post’s claims.
""This story is totally fabricated. We have encouraged people to donate to relief efforts on the ground. Nothing in this story is true,"" said Brian Cookstra, Clinton Foundation spokesman.
In an Aug. 28 Medium post , the Clinton Foundation published a list of members of the foundation's community who are providing relief to survivors of Hurricane Harvey. Those organizations include the American Red Cross, Houston Food Bank and Americares, which the foundation said has responded to requests for water and medications.
The Clinton Foundation is an international humanitarian charity that came under scrutiny by Hillary Clinton opponents during the 2016 presidential campaign. (PolitiFact fact-checked several claims related to the foundation and how it compares to the Trump Foundation .)
Bill Clinton has supported national relief efforts in the past, but that was done through separate partnerships. For instance, he worked with former President George H.W. Bush to create a charity, the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund , to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

"John Hagee calls for ""prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse."" A fake story about a televangelist who wants to criminalize enthusiastic pillow talk shows that sometimes humor and the news can make strange bedfellows.
A story posted around Feb. 10, 2017 , on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) cites a supposed screed by John Hagee , senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. He also is CEO of Global Evangelical Television .
""John Hagee calls for ‘prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse’,"" reads the headline on the story, in which Hagee denounces blasphemy.
The text quotes Hagee as saying that ""there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex."" Women who do so should be jailed, the story quotes Hagee.
As part of its efforts to fight fake news, Facebook flagged the story as potentially being false. And the story is very false, even though it’s not immediately apparent on many the websites that have shared it .
Hagee is a controversial figure for his past remarks, which include criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court striking down same-sex marriage bans as ""judicial tyranny"" and saying the Holocaust was part of God’s plan to drive Jews from Europe.
But he never said women should be jailed for invoking the almighty while having sex. Not that we can prove, anyway.

"""Pence: ‘Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had’"" Vice President-elect Mike Pence attacked First Lady Michelle Obama as the most distasteful woman to ever live in the White House — at least according to a fake news story on a website that bills itself as satirical.
A headline on an Oct. 14, 2016, story on Politicono.com declared ""Pence: ‘Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had’."" Users flagged the suspicious post as part of Facebook’s attempt to stop the spread of fake news.
The story was pegged to a real instance of Pence defending Donald Trump, who was then the GOP presidential candidate running against Hillary Clinton. Michelle Obama had said in a speech on Oct. 13 , without mentioning Trump by name, that a 2005 recording had shown the GOP nominee admitting to ""sexually predatory behavior.""
Pence appeared on CBS This Morning on Oct. 14 and sounded puzzled by Michelle Obama’s comments.
""Look I have a lot of respect for the first lady,"" he said. ""But I don’t understand the basis of her claim.""
But that’s about as far as Pence’s comments went. He never called Obama vulgar, and certainly not the most vulgar first lady ever.
That’s because Politicono.com is a website (its slogan is ""Just Enough News"") that takes a kernel of real news and sprouts an entire fabricated story around it.
It says readers come to the site to read ""a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.""
Indeed, at the top of the Pence story are two buttons: ""Show facts"" and ""hide facts."" Clicking the ""show facts"" button highlights only the first paragraph of the story. The rest is entirely made up.
Politicono.com didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but when we talked to them for another fact-check in 2015 , an administrator pointed out they admit some content is exaggerated.
That makes the website less culpable than many others that give no indication something may be contrived, but it’s still not immediately apparent the story is fake. It’s also very misleading to build upon a real event and then purposely obscuring which part is true and which is not. The comments section on the story itself certainly shows many have been fooled.
Either way, Pence did not call the first lady vulgar.",0,Politicono.com
"Michelle Obama Just Received Life-Shattering News from the Doctor A fake news story says that former First Lady Michelle Obama has been diagnosed by a doctor with having a habit of making disparaging remarks about America in order to save her husband’s presidential legacy.
""Michelle Obama just received life-shattering news from the doctor"" read the headline on March 4, 2018 on NY FOX News, a blog with no real affiliation to Fox News , a Fox News spokesperson confirmed.
The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
We found many things wrong with this post.
The story begins by accusing Obama of staying out of the public eye only to appear when slamming President Donald Trump. It goes on to say that she has been unofficially diagnosed by Dr. Lauren A. Wright , a public affairs professor at Princeton University and a board member of the White House Transition Project.
The ""diagnosis"" referred to is the analysis of first ladies Wright gives in her book, On Behalf of the President. In the book, Wright describes the ways in which Obama helped shape her husband’s legacy from a personal place as a mother and wife, focusing on her use of social media.
While Wright notes that Obama has made more speeches and major public appearances in her first six years in office than any first lady in recent history, she writes that they were in support of her husband’s policy agenda, not slams toward Trump and America.
The NY FOX News post contradicts itself by claiming that Obama has remained out of the public eye yet tries to remain ""the center of everyone’s attention"" by making public remarks against America.
The article notes that one of the biggest claims made by Obama was that America was a racist nation that needed her husband in office. Obama has spoken out about racially motivated remarks that were made against her appearance while she was in office, but she has never claimed that America is ""a racist nation.""
The other claim made is how Obama was never proud of America until her husband had been elected to the White House, a statement made in 2008 that was taken out of context and was debunked as False by PolitiFact in 2017.
The motivations of NY FOX News are unclear. The website appears to have started publishing stories on Feb. 28, 2018, most of which appear to be false. The website includes no contact information, has no ""About us"" page that we could find, and does list any authors. It does not appear to display advertising. The website is registered in Panama.

"""82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty."" A story moving on Facebook would lead you to believe that an elderly California man was sentenced to death after defending himself when he was ambushed by two Muslim men, but the story is fake news.
""82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty,"" said a Jan. 15 headline on The Patriot Report.
The story was previously posted by Ladies of Liberty , a website that defines itself as satire.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story has several made up details including that the photo of the elderly man reportedly sentenced to death in California is actually of a drug trafficker caught in Kansas.
The story said that in October 2015 William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, Calif., was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims -- Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu.
DeLisle, a Marine veteran, pulled a .22 from his ankle holster and shot both men within seconds, leaving one dead and the other paralyzed.
The story said that the ""Dewey County Prosecutor"" said that because the two men were unarmed, the use of deadly force was ""extreme and unnecessary.""
We found no such Dewey County in California, although the county does exist in Oklahoma and South Dakota .
The photo allegedly of DeLisle matches a photo of Marshall Dion taken in Junction City, Kan., when he was arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2013. Dion had a long, colorful history with law enforcement dating back to 1985 when he crashed an airplane in Wisconsin and crawled away, denying that $112,000 found inside and around the airplane belonged to him. In that incident, the government confiscated the money, suspecting it was drug money, but he wasn’t charged.
We searched the names of the alleged suspects in Nexis and found nothing in news accounts. We found nothing about an elderly William DeLisle in California, however, there was a 19th century British pulp-fiction writer by that name who in one book wrote about whites killing all blacks and Asians to create a paradise.
Fake news purveyors have published many false stories that cast Muslims in a negative light, including one about 412 Muslims arrested in a Michigan bust and another story claiming a Muslim man started a California wildfire .

"Says actor Morgan Freeman said, ""Jailing Hillary"" is the best way to ""restore public faith in government.""

""Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt,’ "" read the headline on a story we first saw Oct. 30, 2017, on SnapUSANews.com . Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
We also saw the same post dated Oct. 29 or later on several other websites .
The story claimed that Freeman made the statements during a promotional appearance in New York for the National Geographic series The Story of Us.
""Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President (Donald) Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,"" the fake story quoted Freeman.
Freeman also allegedly said in a profane rant that President Donald Trump was elected to imprison Clinton. Until she is punished, Freeman said, ""everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.""
The fake story rightly points out that Freeman made a video suggesting how Trump should have handled allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. The Story Of Us is a miniseries featuring Freeman traveling the world to interact with different cultures, and premiered on Oct. 11.
But the rest of this story is fiction.
The 80-year-old actor has been an ardent Clinton supporter, narrating political advertisements and a biographical video about the former secretary of state for the Democratic National Committee during her campaign.
The post appeared Oct. 29 on the fake news site YourNewsWire.com , under the byline of Baxter Dmitry. YourNewsWire.com has spread fake stories putting words in the mouths of famous people before, such as when they wrongly posted that Vladimir Putin had said Pope Francis was ""not a man of God.""

"""Breaking: Mike Huckabee just fired!"" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an ally of President Donald Trump, has been fired, a misleading clickbait headline suggested.
""Breaking: Mike Huckabee just fired!"" said a June 11 headline on Red State Wave , a conservative website.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
Nothing in the story said Huckabee was fired. Instead the story said he "" fired off"" at actor Robert De Niro for dropping multiple f-bombs on Trump at the June 10 Tony Awards.
""Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O. Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY & DC, but in the land of ‘God, Guns, Grits & Gravy’ ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness,"" Huckabee tweeted June 11.
He followed up with a more comical rebuttal of De Niro in a second tweet :
""I just called Robert De Niro and told him that he's out of my ‘circle of trust.’ He cried like a 6 year old who didn't get cake at the birthday party and begged to get back in. http://No.Can.DO .""
Huckabee linked to a scene in the movie Meet the Parents in which De Niro, a retired CIA officer, tells his future son-in-law, played by Ben Stiller, he is now in the ""circle of trust.""
Huckabee ran for the GOP presidential nomination  in 2016 but later endorsed Trump . He is now the host of ""Huckabee"" on TBN and a Fox News contributor. His daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders is Trump’s press secretary.
The Red State Wave article about Huckabee was written by an unnamed ""MAGA student,"" a reference to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again.""

"""Bill Clinton’s hitman confesses on his deathbed."" A fake news story says that former President Bill Clinton’s hitman has carried out more than 60 murders at the request of Clinton and his wife ""Killary.""
""Bill Clinton’s hitman confesses on his deathbed,"" stated a Jan. 8 headline on The Patriot Report .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story, which has circulated on multiple websites, lacks any evidence and is filled with ridiculous, made-up statements.
The story’s only source is an alleged intern -- unnamed -- who interviewed the alleged hitman on behalf of Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
The story said that the hitman who operated under the alias Wilshire Williams (but was actually named Terrence Wilekenmeyer) was a low-level runner for the mafia until he was sold to Clinton in exchange for 12 cases of confiscated Arkansas moonshine.
But now dying of pancreatic cancer with one week left to live, the hitman wanted to come clean and told his story to the Fox News intern.
The intern allegedly told The Patriot News that the hitman ""put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history.""
Foster was the former White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. Rich was the Democratic National Committee worker who was murdered in 2016. Both deaths have been the subject of conspiracy theories.
We noticed that the supposed real name of the hitman -- Terrence Wilekenmeyer -- was the same last name as Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer, a pen name used by one of the biggest purveyors of fake news, Christopher Blair .
A Fox News spokeswoman Jaclyn Giuliano said that Hannity had no involvement whatsoever in the story alleging a Clinton hit man confessed on his deathbed.
The Patriot Report’s website claims that it offers ""solid conservative perspective on the issues of the day"" and aims to ""to equip the current generation of American Patriots with the right information"" to support and defend the unalienable rights of man.

""CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent,"" said a May 18 headline on Your News Wire .
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
Your News Wire , a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website Breitbart , which celebrated a recent drop in CNN’s ratings.
Your News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the ""nosedive"" in ratings ""the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.""
The story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so.
CNN spokespersons didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
While a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don’t reveal much about a network’s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it's built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others.
For example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to a Senate panel about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga.
The idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump’s allegation that the network is ""fake news.""
While Trump uses the term ""fake news"" to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at PolitiFact we refer to fake news as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events.

"""Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand."" A fake news story said that President Donald Trump greenlit a pre-dawn raid on a mansion and compound owned by former President Barack Obama in Thailand.
""Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand,"" said a Dec. 27 headline on the website Someonesbones.com.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The photo of the alleged Obama compound in Thailand is actually a resort, and a Pentagon spokesman told PolitiFact that the story was false.
Someonesbones describes itself as ""primarily dedicated to exploring the Nibiru realities and exposing scientific and govermental corruption."" (Yes, the website can’t spell ""government"" and says that the government and mainstream media are liars.)
The story by Someonesbones has no actual evidence and quotes an anonymous source who said that Obama owns real estate and shadow companies across the globe.
The story said that Obama, by proxy through the Solyndra Corporation, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate in Thailand.
Solyndra was a solar company that received money as part of the stimulus package. The U.S. Department of Energy invited Solyndra to apply for money in 2006 before Obama took office. The collapse of Solyndra in 2011 became political fodder leading up to the 2012 election.
In Someonesbones’ made-up raid, Delta Force seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese-manufactured firearms and explosives. (The only truthful part of that is Delta Force is an actual elite counter-terrorism unit.)
Another sign that this is fake news: the story identified the prime minister of Thailand as Nik Bukharin while the actual prime minister is Prayuth Chan-ocha. ( Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin was a Soviet political leader who died in 1938.)
The story had green and black images of what appeared to be military officers in night vision goggles. We searched the photos on Google images and one appeared to be similar to an image used in a 2013 story about the movie Zero Dark Thirty , which was about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.
The photo of the fictitious Obama compound in Thailand is actually Villa Rak Tawan , a luxurious estate in Phuket used for vacations and weddings.

"The United States ""has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP."" As congressional Democrats and Republicans sit down for high-stakes budget talks, the rhetoric has flown furiously to familiar territory. Republicans want cuts and reforms to entitlement programs, while Democrats insist that revenue must be on the table, too.
Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., made the case for the latter in an interview on MSNBC on Nov. 12, 2013.
""This country has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP,"" she said. ""It doesn't feel that way when you hear about austerity and we have to cut this and we have to cut that. It's because the income inequality is greater than it has ever been.""
We wondered if she was correct.
The numbers don’t lie
Schakowsky’s office sent us figures from the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to those numbers, the GDP per capita, when adjusted for inflation, hit $45,633 this year, which surpassed the previous high of $45,360, which was set in 2007 prior to the most recent recession. It was barely higher, but higher all the same. (The government defines the GDP — gross domestic product — as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.)
We were curious how the data was calculated, so we contacted Mathew Shane, an economist with the USDA who put the figures together. He told us that the 2013 number was partially based on a projection, since the year is not yet completed. But if that projection is borne out, he said, then GDP per capita will be at its highest level ever.
""It’s close,"" Shane said. ""We hit a peak in 2007 when the crisis hit. There’s been no income growth in real terms since 2007. The difference between (2007 and 2013) is a very modest difference. We, essentially, finally regained what we were in 2007. I guess we could say we’re projected to be slightly better than we were in 2007.""
If ""I guess"" doesn’t sound definitive enough, we also sought out another source: the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the government agency that calculates the nation’s GDP. The bureau’s analysis also backs up Shane’s findings.
By the second quarter of this year, GDP per capita had surpassed 2007 levels. ""The third quarter of 2013 is the highest on record,"" said Thomas Dail, spokesman for the bureau.
Finally, GDP per capita, even when adjusted for inflation, has gone up and up for more than a century. In other words, Schakowsky could have said what she said at virtually any given point during the last 150 years and had a pretty good chance of being right.",1,Jan Schakowsky

"""Fox Sports cancels all NFL broadcasts ‘until players respect the flag.’ "" A fake news post claimed Fox Sports would stop broadcasting NFL games as long as players continued to kneel during the Star-Spangled Banner, which was clearly false if you watched football on the network over the weekend.
The headline on story posted Sept. 24, 2017, on TheLastLineOfDefense.org read, ""Breaking: Fox Sports cancels all NFL broadcasts ‘until players respect the flag.’ "" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The post noted that President Donald Trump had demanded on Twitter that NFL players "" stop disrespecting our Flag & Country "" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand.
""Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games,"" the story read.
The story linked to footage from Fox News Channel showing on-air personalities discussing the row between the president and the league.
Fox didn’t really boycott any games, of course, because the story is fake.
More than 200 players across the NFL chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism, and Fox still broadcast games on Sept. 24. The network has paid $1.1 billion for the rights to show National Football Conference games, plus playoff games and the Super Bowl every three years.
The same article also was reported in posts on several other websites , without any indication it was from TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That can cause confusion, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only made-up stories.

"""Breaking: Santa Fe killer expresses his love for Obama."" Within hours of the shooting at Santa Fe High School, fake news stories appeared on social media claiming that the shooter had clear political allegiances.
""Breaking: Santa Fe killer expresses his love for Obama,"" said a May 18 headline by The Daily World Update.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We found no evidence that the suspect loved Obama.
The story falsely said that ""Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas."" The story invented a ""leaked interview with police"" in which the suspect ""admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to ‘end gun violence’ by adding another shooting.""
The first sign that this is made up is that the suspect’s name is wrong; his actual name is Dimitrios Pagourtzis.
The story also makes up all sorts of ridiculous details, including that suspect’s father is serving a life sentence for stealing ""6,000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon.""
Law enforcement has not released information about a motive for the mass shooting that left 10 people dead. The mother of one victim said that her daughter had recently turned down the advances of the boy.
The Daily World Update is linked to a frequent purveyor of hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. While Blair identifies The Daily World Update as satire, other blogs often pick up Blair’s stories without the satire asterisk.
Fake accounts imitating the suspect on Facebook also depicted him wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.

"""Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes"" Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore appeared to hold out hope that military ballots would reverse his loss to Democrat Doug Jones -- and the theory was circulated as fake news.
""Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes,"" said the headline on the website defense-usa.xyz on Dec. 15, three days after Moore, a Republican, lost to Jones. We found no contact information on this website to probe the story further.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The special U.S. Senate election in Alabama was the subject of many fake news stories . This one, too, is fake.
According to the story, the ""Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity"" had sent emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count, which showed that Moore led by 5,014 votes after 97 percent of the vote had been counted.
Jones would have to pay $213 million for a recount, the story stated.
""The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount,"" stated the article. ""They can never just admit when they lost.""
In reality, there is no such entity as the ""Alabama Secretary of State’s Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity."" And the number of ballots cast do not bear out what the story alleged.
The official Alabama Secretary of State’s website showed that Jones received 671,151 votes while Moore received 650,436.
Moore appeared to hope that military and provisional ballots would turn the tide for him after the election. In a Dec. 15 email to supporters, Moore wrote that those votes were yet to be counted and that the election was ""too close to call"" and ""the battle is NOT OVER!""
On Dec. 20, Secretary of State John Merrill provided information showing that there were 366 military and overseas ballots returned. Merrill also reported that there was a total of 4,967 provisional ballots received and of those, 2,888 had been verified. That means that even if all of the overseas and provisional ballots were cast for Moore -- an unlikely scenario -- that would not add up to enough to change the outcome of the race since Jones had a lead of more than 20,000 votes.
The state is expected to certify the election results on Dec. 28. A spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office said that the final results are not significantly different from the unofficial numbers from election night but will include slight increases for both candidates due to the late-counted military and provisional ballots.
The viral post saying Moore pulled ahead of Jones thanks to overseas and provisional ballots is not accurate.",0,defense-usa
"""No member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power — a record unmatched by other fuels."" Not only is nuclear power reliable and efficient, it's also extremely safe, Sen. Lamar Alexander wrote in an op-ed column in the newspaper The Hill.
""No member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power — a record unmatched by other fuels,"" wrote Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, along with Theodore Rockwell, a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and a vice president of Radiation, Science and Health Inc.
Considering the history of incidents like Three Mile Island and the deadly Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, we decided to take a closer look at the history of commercial nuclear power plants, and see if, in fact, no one has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power in the United States.
In order to help narrow our search, we decided not to count a death from a workplace hazard, for example slipping and falling. We're specifically looking at the workers in plants who are killed from the process of creating nuclear power.
Alexander's staff told us the senator got his facts from the American Nuclear Society Web site, which states in a ""Myths and Facts"" section that ""No member of the public has ever been injured or killed in the entire 50-year history of commercial nuclear power in the U.S.""
We confirmed that with David Decker, congressional analyst for the government's Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal agency in charge of nuclear plants.
""I believe that the senator's statement was that there have been no deaths due to nuclear-related accidents at commercial nuclear power plants. From our perspective, this would be true,"" Decker said.
There have, however, been deaths at nuclear plants. Some people have died in workplace accidents in non-nuclear areas of the plants. And three fatalities occurred at a research reactor rather than a commercial plant (Alexander specified commercial plants).
Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Oversight Project at Beyond Nuclear, a group that works to eliminate nuclear use in the United States, cited an accident that killed three men in 1961.
They were members of the military working at an experimental nuclear plant in Idaho Falls, Idaho. They died in an accident related to the improper removal of control rods and a chain reaction of the uranium, according to a 1961 Milwaukee Journal article. The explosion released so much radiation that rescuers could only enter the area to recover the bodies for one minute at a time. The bodies were so radioactive that they were buried in lead caskets. (One is at Arlington National Cemetery.)
In a 1986 incident, four workers were killed at the Surry power plant in Virginia from the rupture of a pipe that sprayed workers with scalding water and steam. But the accident happened in a non-nuclear portion of the plant.
Despite these deaths, nuclear power does stack up as one of the safest forms of energy. It's difficult to get a good comparison with other power-source fatalities because the numbers don't necessarily separate between common workplace hazards and those specifically related to the power source. But for comparison, 13 people have been killed in hydroelectric power generation since 2003, and fossil-fuel electric power generation has killed 23 since then, said Andrew Marsh, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
So while people in the United States have been killed in non-commercial plants and in non-nuclear areas of a commercial plant, Alexander is right that no has been killed ""by commercial nuclear power."" And those statistics and the most complete numbers we can find for other energy sources confirm his claim that it is a record unmatched by other fuels.",1,Lamar Alexander
"""Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible."" A fake news story that claimed discount store chain Target would no longer sell the Bible doesn’t stand up to a more careful reading.
The website NewsLeak.co, which is registered to an address in the Eurasian capital of  Tbilisi, Georgia , ran an undated story around Feb. 16, 2017 , with the headline, ""Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible."" The story was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to rid its news feeds of fake news.
The story said the store had been under fire for its policy of allowing transgendered customers to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identified. That part is accurate .
But the story veers into false territory by saying Target CEO Bryan Hornell claimed the chain ""will no longer cater to religious extremists"" by selling the Bible. Hornell allegedly said in a letter that Targets would start phasing out anything related to religion — including Christmas decorations — in its stores .
There are many examples of this story all over the Internet , but none of them are true.
They’re all based on a ( currently deleted ) May 16, 2016, story from NationalReport.net, a site that generates made-up articles. ""All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news,"" its disclaimer reads .
That disclaimer isn’t on the stories themselves, and don’t look to appear on earnest reposts of the article on other sites.
Beyond that, there are clues that this isn’t a real story, starting with the fact that the chairman and CEO of Target is Brian Cornell , not Bryan Hornell.
As for being able to buy the good book, a search of the Target.com website turns up 791 results in a search for ""Holy Bible,"" so it’s readily available.
But just to make sure, we contacted Target’s public relations department, which assured us that yes, you can still buy the Bible in stores. And no, there were no plans to change that.
Target did eventually start offering private bathrooms to try to settle the boycott over transgendered bathrooms, but it never said it would stop selling the Bible.",0,Bloggers
"Says ""CNN host Fareed Zakaria calls for jihad rape of white women."" CNN’s Fareed Zakaria presents himself as an urbane observer of the global scene and not the sort of person to call for violence against women. But the website teoinfo.com sought to cast Zakaria in a much different -- and false -- light.
The website ran an article June 30 with the headline: CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women . Facebook readers flagged the story as being potentially fake, so we decided to investigate.
For fake news watchers, the opening paragraph of the story was a stroll down memory lane.
It said, ""Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in the Washington Post.""
Not only is that bizarre, it is a word-for-word copy and paste from an article over a year ago on the satirical website The People’s Cube. The self-described site for ""political humor"" once touted that it ranked No. 13 on a list of humor blogs. Among its recent headlines, it announced, "" Russia adds St. Patrick’s Day to list of excuses to get drunk ,"" as part of the country’s ""Day Without Sobriety"" campaign.
The website adopts a faux-Soviet style, purportedly the brainchild of ""a former Soviet agitprop artist."" When the article first appeared Jan. 2, 2016 , Zakaria complained that he was the victim of internet trolls. In response, the People’s Cube (it features a Rubik's cube with red on all sides) published an open letter on Jan. 18, 2016.
""This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth."" (The author’s avatar is a cheeto with a Che Guevara face, which makes sense if you say Chedoh the ""right"" way.)
According to the Teoinfo/People’s Cube article, Zakaria wrote, ""The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes,"" and went on to say ""thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves.""
The rumor-busting website Snopes declared it false in January 2016.
Despite the article’s satirical roots, warning labels or disclaimers were lost as it moved from site to site. Reclaim Australia Rally, a group that asks ""all patriotic Australians to stand united against Islamisation and home grown terror threats,"" shared the Teoinfo post on its Facebook page on July 2.

"""Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet."" Bill Gates is not attempting to depopulate the planet, contrary to a false claim on a website called Mysterious Times.
""Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet,"" said an April 30 post on mysterious-times.com, filed under its "" Conspiracy "" category.
The post’s supposed evidence includes efforts by Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to research, develop and deliver vaccines to help reduce child mortality.
It claimed Gates ""has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that ‘by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.’""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
""Make no mistake, when Gates talks about ‘making people healthier,’ what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory rollout of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents,"" the post said.
It also claimed that vaccinations promoted in India by the Gates Foundation ""were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls"" and that it conducted experimental vaccine trials. But PunditFact in December 2016 debunked a post on an anti-vaccine blog claiming Gates used ""30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer"" and that vaccination efforts led to deaths. That Pants on Fire post was a mash-up of outdated, disproven rumors.
Mysterious Times doesn’t offer many details about its website, but the About section of its Facebook page says: ""Aliens UFOs, Conspiracy and Weird Stuff.""
Gates does not seek to ""depopulate"" the planet, but believes saving children’s lives can help reduce population growth.
When children survive, families decide to have fewer children and that ""can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call ‘the demographic dividend,’ "" Gates said in the 2018 edition of the annual letter he co-writes with his wife, Melinda.
""When more children live, you get one generation that’s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically—and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people),"" Bill Gates said in the 2018 letter. ""That’s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education.""",0,Bloggers

The brief post said that Pelosi ""was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda"" and quoted the unmistakably fake Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, the alleged head of psychiatry, as saying Pelosi may not recover.
There is absolutely no proof this incident happened, of course, and a Pelosi spokesman had no comment. The image used at the top of the story is taken from NBC footage recorded after a shooting at the Capitol on March 28, 2016 .
But FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it — it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet.
That site was run by a man named Christopher Blair , who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He said his aim was to trick conservatives with absurd and fictional news stories that exposed how gullible they were.
A Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair , and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him. The site was registered on Aug. 18, 2016. Its posts are archived back to March 21, 2017 .
We tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site’s owner but didn’t get any response. The Pelosi post is credited to an author called ""Truth Dealer,"" who is crosslisted as Alan Whitemor .

"In the past three years, state legislatures have ""enacted more of these restrictions (on abortion) than in the previous 10 years combined."" Forty-one years ago this week, the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade, the landmark case that expanded women’s abortion rights. Fast forward to today, and access to abortion is still a hotly debated issue.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., defended abortion rights in a statement on her website for the case’s Jan. 22 anniversary.
""In 2013, our nation saw yet another record-breaking year of state legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women’s access to abortion services,"" she said. ""In fact, in the past three years, the United States has enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years combined.""
We wanted to zero in on the numbers of state abortion restrictions to see whether the number of restrictions skyrocketed over the last three years.
Murray’s office didn’t return our requests for comment, but we found data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. The group first outlined the differences in abortion restrictions by year in a report released Jan. 2, 2014.
Counting different provisions in the same bill independently, the group tallied 205 new abortion restrictions during the period 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 during the 10 years through 2010. Now, out of the 205 restrictions, there are 25 not currently in effect, either because a court struck them down or a court case is pending.
Guttmacher tracked these all 205 restrictions in 10 categories, four of which accounted for nearly half of the restrictions from the last three years: abortion bans, regulations on abortion providers, abortion medication, and private insurance coverage for abortion. (Using the Guttmacher data, the Washington Post made their own handy breakdown of abortion restrictions by state.)
For perspective, in 2000, Guttmacher considered the two most restrictive states to be Utah and Mississippi, both of which had restrictions on the books in five of the institute's 10 categories. By 2013, 22 states had five or more restrictions. Louisiana had restrictions in all 10 categories.
Methodological differences mean there’s room for debate over the exact number of restrictions, even among abortion-rights groups.
While Guttmacher reported 205 abortion restrictions over the last three years, the Center for Reproductive Rights counted approximately 130, said Amanda Allen, the center’s state legislative counsel. That’s because the Center for Reproductive Rights counted each bill just once, regardless of how many different provisions it may have included. The center hasn't been tracking the legislation since 2000, so they don't have a comparable number to pit against Guttmacher's 189 from that decade.
While both groups that compiled the numbers are pro-abortion-rights, their figures aren’t being contested by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. A spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List told PolitiFact that the Guttmacher study ""certainly appears to be accurate.""",1,Patty Murray

""Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise,"" the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016).
The article speculated on Cher’s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim.
""However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger,"" the post said.
Several celebrities did say they would leave the United States, including to Canada , if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to another planet , Jupiter.
In reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: ""IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER ðŸ˜–""
We reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher’s website lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her Twitter feed features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a search of the word ""Canada"" in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north.

"" Oscar Pistorious commits suicide in Prison ,"" topped the article on a website that flies under the masthead of City Herald. The additional ""o"" indicated the piece was dodgy, but the blunders didn’t stop there.
The article said Pistorius hanged himself in his prison cell, allegedly by tying a bedsheet to a window. It noted that prison officials announced the death on Saturday, but then added that he died at 5:30 in the morning on Sunday.
Comments posted on the article’s webpage showed that odd time sequence didn’t slip by careful readers.

""Rekord has spoken the brother, Carl Pistorius who said that the family knows nothing of the sort,"" the paper reported July 17 .
Similarly, the official website for Oscar Pistorius has nothing about his death.
Pistorius is serving a six-year sentence for shooting his girlfriend in 2013, sparking a courtroom drama that drew worldwide attention. Pistorius, a Paralympic gold medalist, claimed he fired on Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder in the couple’s apartment.

"""Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart."" A fake news story circulating for several months on Facebook claimed that employees at a Walmart in Decatur, Ala., were operating a meth lab in the store, leading to one of the biggest police drug busts in decades.
""Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart,"" stated a headline on the website ufconly.com on Dec. 10.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This article is bogus.
The same story appeared in March 2017 on the website Empire News , a website with a disclaimer that it is for entertainment purposes only.
The story said that police received an anonymous tip about a horrible burning smell from the back of the Walmart. An officer discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.
The story stated that an ""unofficial spokesperson did say that they were ‘disappointed’ that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.""
One sign that this story is fake news: It provides a lengthy quote from ""Chief Robert Garner,"" even though in Decatur the police chief’s name is Nate Allen . He told PolitiFact that there was no such bust.
""This is fake news, and no, we don’t have a Chief Robert Garner,"" Allen said in an email.
Tara Aston, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told PolitiFact in an email that the company was unaware of any meth lab being discovered at an Alabama store.
While we found no news reports about busts of meth labs inside an Alabama Walmart, we did find some news reports about busts involving mobile meth labs in Walmart parking lots. In August 2016, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y.
The "" about"" section of the Ufconly website doesn’t describe the website’s content and instead stated that ""Ufconly is a small village in the mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa."" We found no such place.
There is no evidence that police discovered a meth lab inside a Walmart in Decatur, Ala.",0,Ufconly
"Hillary Clinton ""agreed with (John McCain) on voting for the war in Iraq."" Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic contrast to John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner.
In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues.
Among Obama's points: ""It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq.""
Obama is referring to the 2002 vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, widely considered to have given President Bush the authority for the invasion. Clinton voted for the measure, as did McCain. Obama was not in the U.S. Senate at that time, though he did give a speech opposing the war while an Illinois state senator.
Obama is right: Clinton and McCain were on the same side in voting for the use of force in Iraq.",1,Barack Obama
"""Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons"" After New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stepped down amid allegations that he abused women, a story without any evidence circulated on Facebook that he covered up a sex cult.
""Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons,"" said a May 9 headline by the NY Evening News, a website that has sections on conspiracies and UFOs. The story attributed the information to Your News Wire , which frequently posts fake news.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story smashes together an actual federal criminal case against organizers of a sex cult to falsely allege that it involves Schneiderman selling children to the Clintons.
Schneiderman resigned May 7 following a report by The  New Yorker  that four women accused him of physical assault. He denied the allegations.
The NY Evening News story said, ""Schneiderman used his position as Attorney General to cover-up the crimes of NXIVM – a cult recently exposed as selling child sex slaves to the Clintons.""
The criminal case about the sex cult NXIVM (pronounced Nex-e-um) is real, although the NY Evening News story makes up details. We previously rated a claim that defendant Allison Mack, an actress on the TV show Smallville, sold sex slaves to the Clintons as Pants on Fire .
Mack and co-defendant Keith Raniere face real federal charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Both have pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. The victims were then exploited, including sexually.
We searched news accounts for connections between Schneiderman’s office and the case.
In March, Schneiderman’s office filed a court case asking a judge to order Brandon B. Porter, a medical doctor who conducted controversial research on behalf of NXIVM, to turn over records related to studies. The case also asked Clare F. Bronfman, heiress to Seagram and NXIVM operations director, to turn over records. But Schneiderman’s office suspended the state investigation after the March 25 arrest of Raniere on federal charges.
A 2017 story by the  Albany Times-Union  said that law enforcement had fielded complaints about NXIVM for years and that Schneiderman’s office had begun to examine dealings.
""The new interest comes after multiple law enforcement agencies, including Schneiderman's office, had for years brushed aside the concerns from Raniere's critics and others about the murky inner workings of NXIVM, which one expert has characterized as an 'extreme cult,' "" the Times-Union wrote.
We read federal court records and news articles about the case and found no evidence that Schneiderman helped ""NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons."" This mash-up of headlines in the news has no basis in fact.",0,NY Evening News
"Says White House adviser Steve Bannon said, ""Nobody can blame you for beating your wife if it’s out of love."" Like a virus, an old fake news story that claims White House adviser Steve Bannon is an advocate of domestic abuse has made the leap from one site full of contrived articles to another.
A Nov. 14, 2016, post on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) starts with a headline that reads, ""Stephen Bannon: ‘Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love’."" It was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of its crusade to winnow fake news from users’ social media feeds.
The story has been popular on Facebook, which notes the USPOLN.com story link has been shared more than 58,000 times in the past four months.
The story, which is not real, makes up quotes about Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who became White House chief strategist for President Donald Trump. The post includes a reference to real charges Bannon faced in 1996 , when his then-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of domestic abuse.
Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. Those charges were dropped in August 1996 when Piccard did not appear in court. The couple divorced in 1997.
The post cites a Politico interview (which is fake), quoting Bannon as saying that marriage is great because ""you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship."" The quote isn’t worded the same way as the headline.
""And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love,"" Bannon is quoted as saying. ""As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties.""
Again, Bannon did not say these things. They’re made up.
USPOLN.com, which we’ve written about before, identifies itself as ""a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo . The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email.
But the story actually comes from yet another joke site, in an Aug. 26, 2016, post on Politicops.com. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.""
The same story also appears on other sites in the Newslo family , like Politicalo.com and Politicot.com. The articles were posted the day after stories recounting Bannon’s 1996 ran in outlets like Politico and the  New York Times .
Newslo.com stories take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know.

"""Update: van full of illegals caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations."" Democrats used another dirty trick in an attempt to defeat Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore by having undocumented immigrants vote. At least that’s what an article circulating on Facebook claims.
""Update: van full of illegals caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations,"" states a headline on nofakenews.online Dec. 12.
Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a special election to replace Jeff Sessions on Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper.
Facebook users flagged the nofakenews.online post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The article is deliberately false and comes from a website that claims to be satire .
The article states that law enforcement stopped a vehicle containing 13 Hispanic men who had voted at Santa Recto Middle School. (We found no such actual school in Alabama.)
The same men were spotted at multiple cities in Alabama and the State Election Integrity Board arrested 10 of them. All of the men but one were undocumented immigrants, the article says.
""Investigators determined that the men were responsible for 'dozens of fake votes' around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak,"" states the article.
However, there is no State Election Integrity Board in Alabama, John C. Bennett, a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told PolitiFact.
""That does not exist, nor does anyone in the elections’ office have any arrest authority at all so that is super not true,"" Bennett said.
The Secretary of State received no complaints through its online complaint reporting system alleging that undocumented immigrants had voted, Bennett said.
While an Alabama election integrity board is fiction, something similar does exist on a national level: President Donald Trump formed the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity which aims to look for noncitizens on voter rolls . There have been some instances of noncitizens voting in some states, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide.
Nofakenews.com is affiliated with another fake news website America’s Last Line of Defense , among the biggest sources of fake news online. The author of these fake news websites is Christopher Blair who previously told PolitiFact that he designed his parody site to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. However, we’re not sure given the misleading claims of Trump and others of widespread voter fraud that this would meet any reasonable definition of satire.

"""Congress can tell [the Supreme Court] which cases they ought to hear. We have that authority."" With Washington bracing for President Barack Obama to announce his  next Supreme Court nominee, Sen. Arlen Specter, a leading Democrat on  his chamber's Judiciary Committee, has been sharing his views on the  upcoming debate.
During an interview on MSNBC's The Daily  Rundown, Specter told hosts Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie that he  thinks the court has been avoiding tough cases, such as the  constitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program. Specter said  he's even considering conditioning his vote for the nominee based on  whether he or she will take up such cases.
""The Supreme Court has  a very light backlog,"" he said. ""They leave a lot of splits among the  circuits, a lot of uncertainty. And I think they ought to work a lot  harder. . . . Congress can tell them which cases they ought to hear. We  have that authority. And I think Congress ought to exercise it.""
The  last time we checked, there were strict barriers between the three  branches of government, so we were curious about Specter's comment.
Specter's  comment is a bit cryptic; it reads as if he's saying that Congress can  tell the court that it must hear a specific case. His office did  not respond to our request for comment, but the experts we spoke with  said that he's referring to Article III of the Constitution, which gives  Congress the authority to establish appellate jurisdiction.
""In  all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have  appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions,  and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,"" the Article  states.
In plain English, all that means is that Congress can  tell the Court what genre of cases it must hear. For instance, it must  hear appeals on voting issues. Here's what section 5 the Voting Rights  Act of 1965 said about states that seek to establish voting  qualifications or prerequisites:
""Any action under  this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges  in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the  United States Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.""
So,  appeals on decisions made by the special three-judge court regarding  changes in voting qualifications must be heard by the Supreme Court.
Appeals  to the campaign finance rules set out in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform  Act of 2002 -- commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act named for the  two senators who wrote it -- face a similar trajectory: Complaints are  first heard by a three-judge court, and are ultimately decided by appeal  directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. The law also  requires the Supreme Court to hear these cases in an expedited fashion.
In  fact, for much of the last century, many cases fell within the Supreme  Court's mandatory jurisdiction, according to the legal scholars we spoke  with. But in 1988, Congress passed a bill that abolished requirements  that the Supreme Court hear most appeals cases (although it did preserve  mandatory jurisdiction over some types of appeals cases, including  voting rights cases). The idea was to save the Court precious time that  it was otherwise wasting on appeals that had little significance.
So,  is Specter correct?
""It is up to Congress to identify which  cases should go to the Court via appeal,"" Mark Tushnet, a professor at  Harvard Law School, wrote to us in an e-mail. ""So, basically, Senator  Specter's right.""
""Congress can't look around and  say, 'Here's one particular case you have to decide on the merits,'""  Tushnet added. ""They do have to act in general terms.""
Specter  claimed that Congress can tell the Supreme Court which cases it must  hear. According to the Constitution, Congress has the authority to do  just that: it can write legislation that gives the court appellate  jurisdiction over certain cases, as it did when it passed the Voting  Rights Act. However, our experts said Congress cannot tell the Court  that is must hear a specific case.",1,Arlen Specter
"""For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting."" At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States.
""For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting,"" Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event.
Is that correct? We took a closer look.
We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, ""Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros.""
In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio’s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics.
""Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time,"" they wrote.
They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. ""The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing,"" the authors wrote.
Here’s the kicker from the report: ""Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,"" the authors wrote.
Here’s a graph showing the trend line:
Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it’s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn’t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio’s claim is accurate.
""It’s true,"" Litan told PolitiFact, adding, ""We haven’t reversed this yet.""
As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, ""it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.""",1,Marco Rubio
"""Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn’t sorry; then retweets message blaming ‘white boys’ entitlement’ as cause of all school shootings"" Online rumors suggest Parkland shooting survivor and gun control activist Emma Gonzalez bullied the shooter and blamed white male entitlement as the cause of all school shootings.
""Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn’t sorry; then retweets message blaming ‘white boys’ entitlement’ as cause of all school shootings,"" read the headline on Project Republic , a website that claims to provide ""relevant, thought-provoking, and factual news coverage.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The article falsely claims that Gonzalez is on video admitting to bullying and ostracizing the Parkland shooter and saying she was justified in doing so. The website includes a video clip of a speech Gonzalez gave at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says:
""Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should not have ostracized him, you didn’t know this kid. Okay? We did.""
In reality, Gonzalez was responding to a tweet from President Donald Trump that implied people should have been more active in reporting the shooter’s disturbing behavior before people died. The full video clip showed Gonzalez talking about the shooter being mentally disturbed, but she never made any claims about bullying him.
Here is Gonzalez’s comment in full context:
""There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. ‘So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again.’ We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. Okay, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.""
We found no other evidence to suggest that Gonzalez bullied Cruz.
The article then refers to a tweet Gonzalez retweeted on March 27. The tweet from user @edennnnnn said:
""If bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters. Bullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. And white boys are the most entitled demographic by far.""
Project Republic described Gonzalez’s retweet as sentiment to blaming ""white boys’ entitlement"" as the cause of all school shootings. But the tweet isn’t that specific in blaming all school shootings on entitlement.
Project Republic has no evidence to show that Gonzalez bullied Cruz; she didn’t admit; and the retweet doesn’t say what Project Republic said.",0,Project Republic
"Says former president Jimmy Carter said, ""Medical marijuana cured my cancer."" The Internet is getting a sustained buzz from a fake news story about former President Jimmy Carter saying marijuana cured his cancer, but the years-old hoax can only burn readers.
""Jimmy Carter: ‘Medical marijuana cured my cancer,’"" reads the headline on a post dated Dec. 8, 2015 , from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where ""cannabis enthusiasts"" can discuss information related to marijuana.
The post says Carter had become a cannabis connoisseur since being diagnosed, and credited a medical marijuana purveyor in Oakland, Calif., for helping find a proper strain of the drug.
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media network’s efforts to thin out fake news stories. While the story goes back to 2015, it was shared on Facebook more than 1,000 times in the past seven months. Versions of the same story have appeared in links from other websites , as well.
In 2015, Carter was really diagnosed with skin cancer that had spread to his brain, but in December of that year announced the cancer’s growth had been arrested and reversed . Instead of medical marijuana, Carter announced he had been trying a new drug called Keytruda that appeared to help control and reverse the metastatic melanoma .
The fake story, meanwhile, appears to have originated from a Dec. 7, 2015, post on a site called SatiraTribune.com. There’s no disclaimer on the site, but their Facebook page notes that SatiraTribune publishes ""satirical and futuristic news.""
The story is full of cliches about smoking marijuana, including Carter being forgetful and having the munchies for peanuts. It also says Carter would be supporting legalization efforts in several states.
(Four more states voted to allow recreational marijuana in 2016, while three others approved medical marijuana. That brings the total number of states with some form of legal marijuana to 28, plus the District of Columbia.)
Carter’s own record on marijuana is a little hazier than the story makes it out to be. He suggested to Congress in 1977 that possession of up to one ounce of marijuana should be decriminalized, in an effort to keep people out of prisons for smoking the drug. When a CNN anchor asked him in 2012 whether he supported legalization, he said, ""I’m in favor of it. I think it’s OK.""
He recently clarified his position in 2013: ""I do not favor legalization,"" he said at a meeting of state legislators and regulators . ""We must do everything we can to discourage marijuana use, as we do now with tobacco and excessive drinking.""
But perhaps the biggest giveaway is a faked quote from Carter that reads, ""I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.""
That’s actually the opening line from The Toyes’ 1983 weed anthem "" Smoke Two Joints ,"" although many people instead refer to Sublime’s 1992 cover , or even Macy Gray’s 2012 interpretation . We don’t know which version Carter would prefer.
At any rate, this is a fake story that sparked a wave of readers being fooled.",0,Bloggers
"""Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out."" A misleading story on Facebook said that an FBI raid led to White House staffers losing their jobs.
""Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out,"" stated a headline by the New Century Times, a left-leaning website, on Dec. 30.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While staffers were removed from the White House, that happened nearly a year ago and by calling it a ""raid"" over dramatizes the actual news. The same story appeared on another website in February.
The story by New Century Times said that an intelligence agency decided to fight back and sent Trump a message by escorting six staffers out of the White House for failing background investigations.
By calling the event an ""FBI raid"" it conjures up an image of armed personnel storming the White House to take out suspicious staffers. But that’s not the way it sounded in news reports.
The website attributed much of the information to Western Journalism, which describes itself as a source of conservative and libertarian news. In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico.
Western Journalism reported Feb. 16 that the six staffers were escorted from the White House for problems with their SF86 application , a questionnaire for national security positions. The questionnaire , more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant’s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant’s mental health and use of illicit drugs.
The Western Journalism article followed an article by  Politico , which reported based on unnamed sources that some of the aides were ""walked out of the building by security.""
One of the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign director, Politico reported.

She was slated to get another job in Treasury.",0,New Century Times
"Says ""Barcelona terrorist"" is cousins with former President Barack Obama. A fake news story falsely claimed that one of the suspected terrorists arrested after an attack in Barcelona is actually former President Barack Obama’s cousin.
""Barcelona terrorist has a cousin in the U.S. named Barack,"" read the headline on an Aug. 19, 2017, post on NewsConservative.com . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The story said Driss Oukabir, a 28-year-old Moroccan-born man arrested after terrorists killed 13 and injured more than 100 in Barcelona on Aug. 17, had toured the White House in 2009. The trip was sponsored by his first cousin, whom the story named as Obama.
""Oukibir (sic) is the 7th child of the 5th wife of the brother of Barack Obama Sr., Obama’s father from Kenya,"" the story read. ""Being first cousins, he was able to gain an audience and actually sit in the Oval Office. Eight years later he drove a vehicle into a crowd, killing at least a dozen people.""
In reality, Driss Oukabir is the brother of 18-year-old Moussa Oukabir, who is suspected of being the driver of a van that purposely ran into people in Barcelona. As many as three vans, including the one used in the terror attack, were allegedly rented with Driss Oukabir’s ID.
Driss Oukabir turned himself into authorities after media outlets began circulating his photo in connection with the attack. He told police in the Spanish city of Ripoll, where he lived, that his identification had been stolen and that he did not participate in any terrorist activities.
That's where the truth ends. The story of any relation to Obama, however, is pure bunk, and comes from an infamous fake news site.
The post first appeared Aug. 17 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org , a parody site that attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories. It’s run by a self-described liberal troll named Christopher Blair .

By waving their microchipped hand on sensors, employees can get access into the company’s building, sign on to their computers and pay for snacks.
Anti News Network also includes a legitimate quote from a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who said the concept of microchips will likely become more common in the future.
The post also said that ""the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland."" (The Independent reported about that in 2015.)
But there’s no mention in the story about this being a settled matter of policy across the United States. Instead, the story raises concerns about microchipping and calls on Americans to be vigilant.

"Tornado carries mobile home 130 miles, family inside unharmed. It’s not true that a tornado lifted a mobile home and carried it over 130 miles until it landed in a rural Kansas area. And since that never happened, it’s also fake news that there were five family members inside that house who came out of the ordeal without major injuries.
A website called Daily Native American, dailynative.us, posted the fabricated story on Aug. 6, 2017, but the claims have circulated for years. Satirical website worldnewsdailyreport.com posted the same story back in 2015.
""A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area.

""41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado.""
The story claims the tornado carried the house for more than four hours ""sometimes at altitude of more than 1,000 feet,"" across northern Colorado, southern Kansas and then dropped it on a car outside of Wichita, ""129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin.""
We asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration what they thought of the dailynative.us post.
""That's not possible,"" said Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.
Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes and travel an average 3.5 miles.
Stories of papers, checks and other feather-light objects traveling 100 miles do sometimes check out . But heavy objects cannot cover the same ground.
Brooks said even in the ""most violent events,"" wind could not usher a Tulsa mobile home northwest over Colorado before landing near Wichita in southern Kansas. ""That’s a rare direction for even paper to get thrown over significant distances,"" he said.
Dailynative.us does not feature an ""About Us"" page detailing who’s behind it or what is it’s purpose.

"Shepard Smith was fired from Fox News. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith made headlines when he accused the administration of President Donald Trump of employing lies and deception to conceal the details of a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials, a Russian attorney and several others.
In what the  Washington Post  dubbed a ""Walter Cronkite moment"" — a nod to the newsman of yore revered as ""the most trusted man in America"" for his penchant for speaking uncomfortable truths — Smith launched into a TV tirade after a week of shifting accounts about the Trump Tower meeting left the Fox News anchor exasperated.
""Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know?"" he said to colleague Chris Wallace on July 14. ""My grandmother used to say ... ‘Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.’ The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling.""
Now here’s where things get really weird.
Several days after Smith’s on-air editorializing went viral, a website called America’s Last Line of Defense posted a story claiming Smith had been fired by Fox News for criticizing Trump.
The story then takes a wild turn, claiming Smith reacted to his firing like a violent madman in the throes of a Godzilla-like meltdown during which Smith threw things across the Fox studio, kicked barrells and punched Fox News host Sean Hannity in the nose, drawing blood.
There are two major problems with this story, however.
First, as the screengrab below shows, the day after Smith’s supposed firing and meltdown, his hourlong Fox News show Shepard Smith Reporting aired according to its regularly scheduled time.
Second, and most importantly, America’s Last Line of Defense admits it’s a satirical site with a stated mission is to draw readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its extraordinary conspiracies for truth.
""While everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway,"" reads the disclaimer.
At least one website, American News -- which does not explicitly state its satirical intent (if it has one) -- appears to have taken the bait.
As the previous work of our friends at Snopes makes clear, this is not the first time Smith has been the center of a hoax claiming he was fired from Fox News for being too controversial.",0,Bloggers
"""There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting."" An online post that said House Speaker Paul Ryan witnessed the 2016 meeting between former President Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is a fake news story that is part of a larger contrived saga.
A headline on a July 11, 2017, post on Wazanews.tk read, ""There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting."" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The post is based on a real June 27, 2016, meeting Clinton and Lynch had on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, which drew fire because former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was under investigation for keeping a private email server.
Supposedly new information about the meeting came to light, the post said. A Baltimore Morning News reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton.
The story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s ""freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss.""
There’s no newspaper called the Baltimore Morning News, and there’s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake.
Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam , but the story appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com , which makes up its content.
OurLandOfTheFree.com said it ""makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality."" There is no contact information readily available on the site.
The site followed up this story about Ryan joining Clinton and Lynch with several more posts. One said a Justice Department pilot was going to spill the beans about the meeting on Fox News, but ended up being found dead (but not before leaving behind details of the discussion ).
Again, none of it is true.
This is another example of a series of fake stories attempting to fool readers with a bogus saga about an oft-cited political event.",0,Bloggers
"""Malia Obama Fired From Cushy Internship At Spanish Embassy"" It’s summer internship season and everyone loves a juicy story on a former first daughter’s internship cut short due to drug busts. At least fake news sites seem to.
Don’t be fooled, though. A story that Malia Obama was fired from an internship at the U.S. embassy to Spain is fake news.
A June 29, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us says that the eldest daughter of former President Barack Obama was caught smoking marijuana during her internship at the Spanish embassy and sent home.
""She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the U.S. Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons,"" the story said. ""Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist.""
Obama did intern at the embassy, in 2016, not this year. And there were no reports of her dismissal.
This summer, Obama traveled with her family to Bali and Jakarta and is continuing an internship at the Weinstein Company movie studio she began in the spring. She is still expected to go to Harvard in the fall — which the post also denied.
""She won’t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests,"" the post said.
The story said Malia Obama was caught by U.S. Marines, but that’s unrealistic. They are indeed stationed at embassies, but their primary role is that of protecting classified material in the interest of the United States’ national security — not watching over summer interns.
The post also refers to the wrong ambassador. There has never been a U.S. ambassador to Spain by the name of Bedard, and there is actually no U.S. ambassador in Spain at all right now. Trump called for the resignation of foreign ambassadors nominated by Obama at the start of his tenure, and hasn’t replaced previous Spanish ambassador to Spain, James Costos, since.
We don’t know whose carrier pigeons the story refers to, but there were no reports of pigeons during her internship last year, either.
This isn’t the first time a fake news story about the former president’s eldest daughter has made its rounds on blogs and Facebook this year. Previous reports we’ve debunked said that Malia was expelled from Harvard before she even started and that she was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting.
The latest story appeared on FreedomCrossroads.us, an unreliable site that as we have noted previously , has an About Us page that claims it ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth.""",0,FreedomCrossroads.us
"""White House chef quits because Trump has only eaten fast food for 6 months."" A story that said the White House executive chef has quit over President Donald Trump’s preference for drive-thru delicacies was actually served up by a St. Louis-based parody news site.
""White House chef quits because Trump has only eaten fast food for 6 months,"" read the headline on a July 6, 2017, article on HalfwayPost.com .
The post said that White House chef Lisa Mead hasn’t cooked a single meal since Trump took office, instead being forced to ""retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.""
Sources in the story described particular preparation methods Trump favored for his food, which people quoted in the story found difficult to stomach. The post described Trump eating only the skin and fat from Kentucky Fried Chicken and making Mead remove all the brown M&M’s from a McDonald’s McFlurry.
While Trump has been known to favor Col. Sanders at times , this story is ersatz news dressed up as a true story.
As an appetizer, we should note that the White House executive chef is Cristeta Comerford, not anyone named Lisa Mead. The First Lady’s office confirmed Comerford still runs the kitchen, a job she has held since 2005 . (There is a mention of the factual recent resignation of Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub Jr.)
But the real meat of this claim is that HalfwayPost.com identifies itself as being full of contrived stories.
The page header denotes the site as ""a St. Louis gazette of satirical, halfway real news."" It’s "" About the Halfway Post "" page said the staff is ""prone to satirical giggles, so if a headline seems too outlandish to be true it’s probably because we made it up.""
We attempted to contact the site through their online contact form, but did not receive a reply.
Trump’s culinary preferences have been a topic in the media before.
He’s shown a fondness for taco bowls and had promised during his presidential campaign to feed Chinese President Xi Jinping "" a double-size Big Mac "" if he were to visit the White House. Trump opted instead to offer a more traditional steak and fish during Xi’s trip to the United States in April , but that was at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.

"Says former Rep. Michele Bachmann said that ""White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery."" Some clickbait is harder to kill than a vampire.
Recently, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as potentially fabricated a post about a claim purportedly by former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.
Prior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she’s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users.
The article noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, ""Bachmann: ‘White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.’ ""
Oddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the ""quotes"" provided discuss similar themes.
The article quotes Bachmann as saying, ""I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama’s presidency. Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.""
Before we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, as we have noted previously, contains a disclaimer in the ""about us"" tab that reads, ""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
In other words, not a word of this ""story"" should be believed.
However, this isn’t just fake news. It’s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he’s been out of office for six months now.)
We found that an essentially identical article appeared as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what’s real and what’s fake.
If you click on the button, the part about Bachmann’s comments on slavery falls into the ""fake"" category.
Moral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait.
The website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, ""White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.""

"Spicer: ""Trump has the legal right to cancel SCOTUS because they serve at his pleasure"" A June 21 fake news story on USPOLN.com reported that White house press secretary Sean Spicer declared that the president holds the power to disband the U.S. Supreme Court.
""President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision,"" Spicer is quoted as saying in the story.
The story claims Spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing, in which he also announced Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a U.S. Navy ship wreckage and of a terrorist attack in London.
The press conference the post references indeed took place, on June 19. While it was not televised, a transcript was shared on the White House website. Spicer did offer the White House’s condolences to the victims and said Mueller’s fate was in Trump’s hands, but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the Supreme Court.
In fact, the Supreme Court was not mentioned during the briefing.
The story manipulated Spicer’s quote that ""everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the President,"" referring to the fact that Mueller’s superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, ultimately answers to the president. The Supreme Court, however, does not.
The checks and balances put in place by the U.S. Constitution are designed to ensure equilibrium of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches — that means one branch can’t just shut down another.
The Constitution prohibits the president from firing a justice, much less all nine of them, or disbanding the institution they represent. It also hands power over to the courts to decide on the legality of an executive action.
The president may nominate Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges, although these must be vetted by the Senate. Neil Gorsuch is the only Supreme Court justice Trump has appointed so far.
The website that published the story did not respond to a request for comment, but it does contain a disclaimer published in the ""about us"" tab.
""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist,"" the disclaimer reads. ""These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""

"Says the manager of a Checkers in Miami Gardens, Fla., killed 10 employees. An online post that said the manager of a fast food restaurant killed 10 employees was created by a fake news generator apparently devised as a prank.
An undated post on Channel24News.com under the headline, ""Manager killed 10 employees at checkers on 183st and 27ave,"" is only two sentences long. The page’s source code said it was published on June 22, 2017.
""10:30 pm last night police received a call about gun fire in Miami Gardens. Manager killed 10 employees because they was stealing money and tons of supplies,"" it read. It was illustrated with the photo of a Checkers restaurant at 2645 NW 183rd St in Miami Gardens, Fla., between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. As of this writing, the post was shared almost 2,700 times.
The post is fake, because every post from Channel24News.com is fake. It’s a website designed to allow users to create their own stories, whether they are real or not (presumably not).
You should be able to note that right away, thanks to the Yao Ming meme cartoon at the page header, accompanied by the words, ""You Got Owned!""
A note on the righthand side of the website reads, ""You've Been Pranked! Now Create A Story & Trick Your Friends!"" Clicking on the button allows a user to write a headline and body text, and upload a photograph to illustrate it.

The site nominally advises people to be smart about what they create, noting in its footer, ""We do NOT support FAKE NEWS!!! This is a Prank website that is intended for Fun. Bullying, Violent Threats or posts that Violate Public Order are NOT permitted on this Website.""
Of course, a ""prank"" about a shooting at a fast food restaurant is a bit on the violent side, but as of this writing the Checkers story had not been removed.
The site is registered to a Korry Scherer in Milwaukee, Wis . We attempted to reach Scherer at the contact information provided (there’s none on the site) but didn’t hear back.
We didn’t find a record of a mass shooting at a Miami Gardens Checkers, although a man was shot and killed at another location in the town in 2015.

"Photo shows a shark swimming on a freeway in Houston. A viral photo being spread online in the wake of Hurricane Harvey of a shark swimming down a Houston street is actually a hoax that has been passed around for years.
""Believe it or not, this is a shark on the freeway in Houston, Texas. #HurricaneHarvy,"" read a tweet from @Jeggit on Aug. 28, 2017 . The photo appeared to show a shark swimming in the street, as shown from the driver’s seat of a vehicle.
As of this writing, the image had been liked more than 36,000 times and retweeted more than 28,000 times.
But it’s a fake image, which appeared to have been first circulated at least as far back as 2011. The photo turned up after Hurricane Irene struck Puerto Rico . It linked to an Aug. 25, 2011, photo on imgur.com showing the big fish swimming alongside what looks like an SUV.
Then it came back in 2012, with social media users claiming it was taken in New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy.
In 2015, this very same shark had already been spotted in Houston after severe floods.
Then it somehow swam to North Myrtle Beach, S.C. , after Hurricane Joaquin later in 2015.
So where did this really come from? The PhotoShopped image appeared to have taken the shark from a photo that ran in Africa Geographic in 2005 .

"Says Adam Sandler said ""Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across."" A laundry list of fake news sites have posted a story claiming Adam Sandler praised Mormons in a podcast, but there’s no evidence the actor ever made the statements.
The post, which we first saw on WRPM33.com on Aug. 23, 2017 , ran under the headline, ""What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons."" Facebook users flagged this post and several others on different websites as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news.
It’s nothing bad: The post actually says he found them to be exceptionally nice people. It’s just that we can’t find any evidence that Sandler actually said any of it.
The post said Sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and Mormons in particular. Sandler, who grew up in a Jewish family, spoke up to defend the faith.
""I don’t know, Tom. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you’re just having some fun here but — from my experience — Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across,"" the story attributed to Sandler.
He said more in the post, but they aren’t real quotes. Apart from there being a parody out there of his Hanukkah Song adapted for Mormons, we really couldn’t find him making much of any comment about Mormons at all.
But that’s because WRPM33.com and scads of other sites are posting a made-up story. ""Most of the articles on wrpm33.com are works of fantasy or satire and are not true,"" the site’s disclaimer said . The sites use domain names that sound like official media outlets, but don’t contain any apparent contact information.
These are the same kinds of websites responsible for other stories we’ve looked at that claim celebrities have said or done things they haven’t. One popular story said that a celebrity made nice comments about the residents of a town after car trouble . Another post claimed that a celebrity enjoyed a town so much, they are moving there .
In both cases, the name of the town and celebrity can change, with the bulk of the story staying the same. There’s even another subset of links telling readers that a Star Wars movie will be filming near their city .
The object is clearly to get residents of the town named to click on the link, to earn advertising revenue for the (unidentified) owners of the site.
We’ve already seen another version of this story that attributed the same quotes to Matthew McConaughey . More are sure to come.

In 1997, he was the lone ""nay"" vote against a bill called the Volunteer Protection Act, which exempted Good Samaritans from being sued. In 2000, he was the only senator who voted against a resolution ""encouraging local schools to insist on zero-tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use.""

Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb the spread of fake news.
The fake post said that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, flew to Lviv, Ukraine, on Oct. 27, which was the same day a grand jury approved criminal charges in the Special Counsel’s Office investigation.
The announcement of who was actually being indicted didn’t come until Oct. 30, giving fake news purveyors a couple of days to peddle false stories.
The story originated on Oct. 28 at FreedomJunkshun.com , which had written a series of posts implying Hillary Clinton was a potential target of Mueller’s probe. The site included a photograph of the Clintons at an airport, but that image was from the 2013 renaming of the airport in Little Rock, Ark. , after the political power couple.
The story notes that Ukraine has no extradition treaties with the United States, which is true . And Hillary Clinton has been to Lviv, but that was as first lady 20 years ago .
In reality, Hillary Clinton was in Washington on Oct. 28 , not Ukraine, for a speech at the Human Rights Campaign’s national dinner. She was then in the Chicago suburbs on Oct. 30 to sign copies of her new book, What Happened.

Since we first saw the post, there have been only three hurricanes in the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee.
Jose , which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. Maria has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And Lee remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores.
The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms.
Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season.
Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be the most active hurricane season since 2010.

Its About Us page carried a disclaimer that read, ""We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.""

The hook to the story is the real news that Rice had asked the National Security Agency to reveal the names of several senior Trump officials in intelligence reports about the presidential campaign and transition.
Rice told U.S. House of Representatives investigators she did so to determine why Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of of United Arab Emirates, had visited New York in December 2016, CNN reported . The prince met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former strategist Steve Bannon at Trump Tower.
United Arab Emirates officials did not tell President Barack Obama’s administration the prince was visiting, which broke with diplomatic practice. The country later tried to set up back-channel communications between the Trump White House and Russia.
Trump in April had accused Rice of possibly committing a crime by seeking the names of the Trump officials involved, but there’s no evidence that’s the case.

"Says Donald Trump is ""canceling funding for Obama’s free house and library."" A viral story on Facebook says that President Donald Trump decided not to pay for Barack Obama’s presidential library, but no such thing happened.
Trump is ""cancelling funding for Obama’s free house and library,"" the Jan. 17 headline on the Patriot Report said.
The story provides no evidence and contradicts actual information about how the Obama library will be funded. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The Patriot Report said that after Trump learned that Obama ordered the U.S. Education Department to divert more than $8 million to build the library, Trump rescinded the money and diverted it to privately held charter schools. Michelle Obama was going to get a private residence on the top floor, but Trump supposedly cancelled that, too.
""Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home,"" the story said.
In the past, presidential libraries have been constructed with private or non-federal funds donated to nonprofit organizations. Some libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments.
The library is then transferred to the federal government and operated and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Some staff and programs at the libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the library.
In May 2017, the Obama Foundation and the records agency announced that the arrangement for Obama’s library would be different from existing presidential libraries.
The Obama Presidential Center in Chicago won’t be in the library network operated by NARA. The center will be privately operated and built by the Obama Foundation, which will raise money for the center. Rather than build a presidential library to hold paper records, the Obama Foundation is providing NARA with digital records. NARA will store and preserve the original materials in an existing NARA facility.
University of Louisville Professor Benjamin Hufbauer, an expert on presidential libraries, said the Obama library gains a couple of benefits by opting out of the typical presidential library system. First, the library won’t have to raise the congressionally-mandated 60 percent of the cost of construction endowment for future maintenance. Also, the library won’t have to build an archival facility for documents, films, video, electronic records.
Similar ridiculous stories about the cancellation of funding for Obama’s library have circulated on other websites for months. Factcheck.org found the same story on the Last Line of Defense in December 2016. While that website had a disclaimer that said ""we present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist,"" the Patriot Report had no such disclaimer.

In a Clinton campaign ad airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, an announcer says the New York senator has been a strong advocate for workers who responded to the 9/11 attacks. ""She stood by ground zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives and kept standing till this administration took action,"" the announcer says.
As you might expect for a senator from the state where the deadliest attack occurred, the record indicates she has been a consistent advocate for workers who responded to the World Trade Center and cleaned up the debris after the two buildings were destroyed.
Soon after the attacks, Clinton and fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer pushed legislation to aid New York City's recovery. She also has been a proponent of government programs to track the health of workers who were exposed to smoke and dust at the site. The doctors who monitored the workers' health credited Clinton with steering $12-million to a Centers for Disease Control program for that work.
Clinton has testified at hearings on the health status of 9/11 workers, and she has publicly criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for its early statement that the air at the World Trade Center site was safe.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees."" Christmas has arrived early for retirees thanks to President Donald Trump, at least according to an article making the rounds on Facebook.
""President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,"" read a Nov. 24, 2017, headline on the website Reaganwasright.com.
The story claimed that millions of retirees will get letters from the IRS ""informing them that President Trump has declared them the recipients of a Christmas stimulus to offset the horrible performance of this year’s Black Friday.""
If this story seems too good to be true, it is.
The story comes from a website associated with a self-described liberal troll who says he tries to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. We found the story about a senior stimulus after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The fake story says that to qualify for the stimulus, recipients must be over 65, retired, receive Social Security and have an income under $40,000 per year. ""The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable,"" stated the article.
The article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don’t receive the letter. (The number printed in the article and it is indeed the switchboard.)
Reaganwasright.com describes itself as a satirical website that uses ""humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.""
The about us page links to the Facebook page of America’s Last Line of Defense , which is run by Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to ""feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.""
They’re also a vehicle to make money. The point, of course, is to get someone on Facebook to click on the post thinking it is real. ""I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income,"" Blair told us previously.
In this case, the Reaganwasright Facebook post includes an innocuous headline, ""President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,"" and a caption that asks people to share the post 1,000 times to show appreciation for Trump. As of this writing, it had been shared 768 times.",0,Reaganwasright
"""First, he said he would leave residual forces in Iraq, and now he says he wouldn't."" Before he declared his candidacy for president, Bill Richardson said in an interview that the U.S. should leave residual troops in Iraq. Speaking to Chris Matthews of Hardball in October 2006, Richardson said America needs a plan for ""responsibly supporting and representing our security interests in the region, and not just leaving without some kind of residual force or some transition force.""
But by April 2007, when he was running for president, Richardson said he would leave no residual forces in the country. In fact, he's stated that position over and over in debates and on his web site as a way to distinguish himself from the Democratic frontrunners. So we'll take him at his word that he's opposed to residual forces.
But what is Richardson's definition of a residual force? Biden's attack cites a Richardson interview with George Stephanoupoulous on April 15, 2007. In that interview, Richardson said, ""I would station some in the region. I would put a majority of them in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda and the Taliban are really, right now, resurrecting. But I would not put them in Iraq. I believe I would leave Marine forces to protect our embassy and other vital American installations. But the point here is, leaving a residual force is going to invite more violence and make our troops targets.""
Based on that statement, it seems Richardson doesn't consider Marines guarding an embassy to  constitute a residual force.  But Richardson's web site www.getourtroopsout.com states that Richardson would leave ""zero"" troops in Iraq. His campaign didn't respond to a question on the embassy issue.
Based on the 2006 Hardball interview, though, Richardson seems to have genuinely changed position on residual forces. And that's the charge that Biden is making.",1,Joe Biden
"""Leonardo DiCaprio explains why he’s moving to Casselberry, Florida."" Leonardo DiCaprio may have signed up for Elon Musk’s trip to Mars, but he isn’t moving to Casselberry, Fla., anytime soon.
In an undated fake news post, kbr31.com announced that DiCaprio told an undisclosed magazine in an interview he would be moving to Casselberry because he is looking for a ""big change"" in his life.
""I’m just tired of the L.A. lifestyle and I feel like, at this point in my life, I’d rather just live in a place full of real, genuine people,"" the post quotes him as saying. ""I’ve been to Casselberry, Fla., a couple of times over the years and the people there are real… they’re genuine, and yeah every community has its problems but the people there are good, decent people and they care about their community. Those are the things I find most important in deciding where to live.""
Casselberry is a real city, located ten miles north of downtown Orlando. But it isn't the Oscar winner’s new hometown.
This isn’t the first time DiCaprio is quoted as saying this, though, nor is Casselberry the celebrity’s only alleged haven from the L.A. lifestyle. Fake news sites have announced DiCaprio’s moves to Gilroy, Calif. , Woodstock, Ill. , Temple, Ariz. , Warren, Mich. , Swedesboro, N.J. , and even to small towns overseas, including Naas in Ireland and Guilford in England.
The stories appear on a chain of websites that seem to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. The sites’ names sound like official media outlets, like ""WCRK 35"" or ""Q 102.""
The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. We previously debunked a fake news story that celebrities’ cars were breaking down in small towns.
Every version of these stories is almost identical, though, with a different town name.The other element that sometimes changes is the name of the celebrity leaving L.A. in search of ""good, decent people"" who care about their community.
If you believe these Internet rumors, you will find that Will Ferrell is moving to Yuba City, Calif. ; Ben Affleck to Delray Beach, Fla. ; Miley Cyrus to Sedalia, Mo .; Eminem to Rocklin, Calif. ; Scarlett Johansson to Clovis, Calif. ; Matt Damon to Missoula, Mont. ; and Bill Murray to Salisbury, Mass.
Needless to say, there is no evidence any of these celebs are packing their bags and heading to your suburb any time soon.

"""The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse."" Sen. Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices.
Sanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis.
""Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard,"" Sanders said . ""As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.""
That claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis?
Sanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers.
""According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs,"" it reads.
The report refers to Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006.
A 2014 Pew report more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That’s a loss of 43 percent.
Of course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed ""took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites."" Here’s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this:
Census Bureau data corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee."" Several websites put a fake headline on a real news story about a Texas sheriff’s deputy being shot and killed, falsely reporting that a trio of Muslim refugees pulled the trigger.
""Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee (sic),"" read an April 4, 2017, post on SouthernConservativeExtra.com. ""Do you support to deport them?"" the headline added.
The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The news story said that Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood was shot once outside a county courthouse building in Baytown near Houston. He was airlifted to a Houston hospital but died of his wound.
The post actually says nothing about refugees, Muslim or otherwise. The only sentence describing a suspect read, ""Investigators said late Monday they were looking for a suspect described as a white or Hispanic male, approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 6-feet-3 inches tall, with short hair and a medium to stocky build.""
There isn’t much more detail on the killer than that. There is no mention of a trio of shooters.
SouthernConservativeExtra.com describes itself as ""conservative news on the cutting edge, from a southern perspective."" It is registered to an address in Texas . We attempted to contact the site via email but did not receive a reply.
The story appears to be a truncated version of the same article and headline posted April 3 on TrueTrumpers.com, a known fake news site. The story and the same headline also has appeared on several other suspect websites .
It looks like all of them copied a real news article from April 3 by the Associated Press. The only difference is the clumsy addition of ""by 3 Muslim refugee"" and the question about deportation.
This may have been done solely to inflame readers who don’t bother to get past the headline and read the details.
In reality, the man who killed Greenwood turned out to be William Kenny, an area man who held a grudge against law enforcement. Authorities had conducted a manhunt for a week, but Kenny had killed himself the day after shooting Greenwood .
While the post is a real news article posted without attribution, the headline is altered to stoke prejudiced sentiments toward Muslims. It’s a gross misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding a law enforcement officer’s death.",0,Bloggers
"""Obama secretly flees US - leaves stunning evidence behind."" An online hoax claims that former president Barack Obama has fled the United States due to some ""criminal confirmations"" discovered by President Donald Trump.
""Obama secretly flees U.S. - leaves stunning evidence behind,"" read the headline on March 22 on Viral Truth Wire, a website promoting sensationalized headlines.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation.
The Viral Truth Wire story claimed Obama’s recent trip to New Zealand was because he wanted to go into hiding due to evidence that he has colluded with Russia and attempted to spy on Trump. The article noted the timing of the trip was also due to the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe.
But Obama’s trip to New Zealand was already confirmed in late February, long before McCabe’s firing. Obama visited the country to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and discuss topics such as climate change and social media’s impact on politics.
The article also claimed that Obama left a ""trail of proof"" through the presidential daily briefings inside the White House proving that he plotted with Russia to obstruct Trump amid the presidential decision.
The hero of the article is depicted as U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, who compiled a memo that accused top FBI officials of alleged wrongdoing. It concluded that Nunes was the one who found that Obama’s presidential daily briefings included illegal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) activity and ""spy games"" targeting Trump. We found no evidence that Nunes has ever made such allegations against Obama.
In March 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, an accusation that the heads of both the NSA and the FBI denied.
What actually happened is that the FBI and the Department of Justice put together an application to the FISA court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence.
Obama himself, however, would have no role in authorizing or requesting wiretaps.",0,Viral  Truth Wire
"""Ken Starr’s plane just disappeared on his way to D.C. to testify against Hillary (Clinton)."" A fake news story claimed that the lawyer who investigated former President Bill Clinton prior to his impeachment died in a plane crash while on his way to give testimony about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
""Ken Starr’s plane just disappeared on his way to D.C. to testify against Hillary,"" read the headline on a March 24, 2017, post on ConservativeFlashNews.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news.
While this post appears on several other websites , ConservativeFlashNews.com indicates that they ""cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information."" There is no immediately apparent way to contact the site.
The story, which is fake, said Starr was flying to Washington when his plane crashed in Wilkershire, Md. — a town that, as far as we can tell, does not exist. The post said five people were killed in the crash.
The post also said that Starr was going to testify before ""special investigative committee that has recently found itself investigating crimes from the 1990s,"" led by U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.
There is no such committee, but Gowdy’s name likely was invoked because he was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi . That committee submitted its final report in July 2016 .
Starr’s investigation into the Clintons, starting with former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster’s death and the Whitewater land deal, eventually unearthed details of Bill Clinton allegedly lying in a deposition about an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky . The allegations in the Starr Report led to Bill Clinton’s 1998 impeachment.
More recently, Starr served as president and chancellor of Baylor University, but left amid accusations that he mishandled a sexual assault scandal to protect players on the school’s football team.
As for the story that he died, its origins have roots in a well-known source of fabricated news. ConservativeFlashNews.com copied the story that appeared on the same date on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The post featured a photograph of a real fatal plane crash during a 2015 air show in England.
The site has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked . As is the case here, TheLastLineOfDefense.org’s posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate that this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""

"If you count United States airstrikes against ISIS, ""75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon."" As the United States struggles with how best to respond militarily to Islamic State advances in Iraq, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a bit of context about how airstrikes in the region are proceeding.
On the May 24, 2015, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, McCain -- a leading Republican voice on military matters -- was asked by host Bob Schieffer, ""You have called this strategy a disaster. But what can, what should we be doing about this?""
McCain responded that the first thing to do is to stop arguing that the United States is making significant progress against ISIS (also known as ISIL, the Islamic State or DAESH).
""We need to have a robust strategy,"" McCain said. ""We need more troops on the ground. We need forward air controllers. But just referring to airstrikes, do you know that 75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon? It’s because we don’t have somebody on the ground who can identify … a moving target. ... We found in Vietnam that if you don’t have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect.""
We wondered whether it’s correct that ""75 percent"" of combat airstrike missions ""return to base without having fired a weapon.""
When we checked with the senator’s staff, they said that McCain -- who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee -- was basing his claim on data he was given by the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, the part of the military that oversees activities the region where the airstrikes are being carried out. The data McCain’s staff had at the time of his appearance on Face the Nation showed that through the end of March, there had been 2,950 strikes out of 12,121 strike-sorties, or 24 percent. That leaves 75 percent of sorties that had no strikes. (Strike-sorties do not include support flights, such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings.)
We double-checked with the Pentagon, and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right.
As of May 27, 2015, the United States had flown approximately 15,600 strike-sorties resulting in approximately 4,198 strikes, said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That works out to 27 percent -- slightly higher than the data McCain had, but close enough for our purposes.
Pentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio.
""The fact that aircraft go on missions and don't strike anything is not out of the norm,"" said Air Force Capt. Andrew ""Ender"" Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs. Despite U.S. strikes being ""the most precise in the history of warfare,"" Caulk said, ""conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges. We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk. However, the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment. This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades.""
Caulk added that if the United States engaged ""the way some of these 'critics' want us to, we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk. The bottom line: We will not stoop to the level of our enemy and put civilians more in harm's way than absolutely necessary.""",1,John McCain
"""ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids."" It is true that Target issued a recall for certain Easter egg toys, as claimed by a blog, however, the recall was for toys sold last year.
""ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids,"" said the headline for a story posted Feb. 8 on news24fresh.info.
The story claims Target ""has issued a massive recall for water-absorbing egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday after discovering the object can expand inside a child’s body, causing life-threatening conditions if ingested.""
Even though the story correctly identifies the toys and associated complications if ingested, it fails to mention that the toys were sold February 2017 through March 2017 , with an April 13, 2017, recall date. The toys were recalled ahead of Easter Sunday 2017. Not Easter 2018.
Facebook users flagged news24fresh.info’s story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. News24fresh.info’s website does not list any information identifying its mission statement, who runs it or who’s behind it.
However, the website does accurately note that the recall involves Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys (with model number 234-25-1200 on the back of the packaging) and Hatch Your Own Dino (with model number 234-09-0016 on a label inserted in the packaging).
The website also has the right description of the potential health problems and complications that can happen if a child ingests the toy; that surgery may be required to retrieve it from the body; and that it may not show up on an X-ray.
The approximate amount of toys sold — 560,000 — its estimated $1 price tag and Target’s offering of a full refund due to the recall is also accurate, matching announcements posted by Target and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
Target also told PolitiFact that the recalls in the news24fresh.info post were all from last year.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission told PolitiFact that generally there’s no end date to recalls, unless there’s an update about a company no longer being in business.
Consumers can still follow up on Target’s 2017 recall for the described Easter egg toys, the commission said.
Target did issue a recall for Easter egg toys. But it did so last year. While recalls generally don’t expire, it seems clear to us that by reposting this story, news24fresh.info is trying to trick people into thinking the recall is new.",1,Bloggers
"Over the past five years, the American automobile industry has ""created about 500,000 new jobs."" During a recent visit to an automobile assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap when he discussed the comeback of the American automobile industry.
""Over the past five years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs,"" Obama said . ""Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, you’re reinventing it -- one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. That’s the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Mich.""
That’s a lot of statistics to chew over, but we decided to look at Obama’s first claim -- that ""over the past five years, (the automobile) industry created about 500,000 new jobs.
We looked at this question back in 2012, when United Auto Workers president Bob King said at the Democratic National Convention that since June 2009, the auto industry ""has added a quarter of a million jobs."" We rated that claim True .
So has the increase in auto-related jobs really doubled since two and a half years ago? Actually, it has.
To determine job creation in the auto sector, we need to combine the figures for two separate categories of jobs. One is "" motor vehicles and parts manufacturing ,"" and the other is "" motor vehicle and parts dealers .""
Between December 2009 and December 2014, the number of jobs in the manufacturing category rose by 230,700 (from 653,300 to 884,000). Over the same period, the number of jobs in the dealer category rose by 272,200 (from 1,616,800 to 1,889,000).
When you put those two categories together, the total increase in jobs over the past five years is 502,900 -- almost exactly what Obama said.
It’s worth noting that this comeback hasn’t brought automotive-industry employment back to its pre-recession levels. The recent pre-recession peak for these two job categories -- in February 2005 -- was 3.03 million. So despite the gains over the past five years, employment in the automotive industry is still down 9 percent from where it was a decade ago.
We’ll also note that PolitiFact’s policy is to consider not just whether a statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question seems to be claiming credit or assigning blame, and if so, whether that credit or blame is deserved.
In this case, it’s unclear whether Obama is taking credit for the automotive-industry job growth, but even if he is, experts have told us that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans, in helping get the industry back on its feet. So we won’t be downgrading the accuracy of this comment on that basis.",1,Barack Obama

Likely concerned by the prospect, Facebook users flagged it as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to stamp out fake news.
The fake post said that Trump was going to take action despite criticism from congressional Republicans, because fake news was still being widely circulated on the site. Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn’t care.
""Inside, we both know what’s been going on. We know the game and we’re gonna play it,"" Trump is quoted in the story.

"""USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption"" An old story has reappeared on social media claiming that the U.S. government has approved the sale of horse meat from slaughterhouses for food.
""USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption,"" read the headline on Newstarget, a website providing information for ""educational and entertainment purposes.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
Here’s the real story: In 2006 , Congress effectively banned horsemeat by forbidding the U.S. Department of Agriculture to spend money on inspecting slaughterhouses. Meat plants can’t operate without USDA inspection.
The last three slaughterhouses in the United States (two in Texas and one in Illinois) closed in 2007, one year after the ban.
The ban was part of the annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011.
In 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law. The bill didn’t allocate any new money for inspections, but activists worried that it might eventually lead to sales of horse meat.
The Newstarget story’s origin is likely from an actual 2012 incident when a New Mexico meat plant received federal approval to slaughter horses for meat, which was met with opposition from many animal rights groups.
The USDA stated that it was required by law to issue a ""grant of inspection"" to Valley Meat Co. of New Mexico, because it had met all federal requirements.
While Valley Meat Co. planned to process horse meat for human consumption in Europe and other export markets, as well as sell it for animal feed at U.S. zoos, there is no evidence that they sold the meat for consumption in the United States.
More recently, a bipartisan ban on slaughtering horses for meat has been included in a spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in March of this year.
The renewed ban on will continue at least until Oct. 1 when the funding bill expires.",0,Newstarget
"""Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018."" The days of mom puffing away on a cigarette in the car while her children are in the back seat are over, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook.
""Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018,"" stated a Feb. 3 headline on Lovethispic.com, a blog that encourages users to share images.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat hoaxes online. We found that the story was misleading because no such federal law kicked in at the end of January.
The blog said that the law applies to any private vehicle and that violators would face up to a $100 fine. It included a photo of a woman smoking in the driver’s seat while children sat in the backseat.
The blog didn’t explain if it was a federal or state or local law -- as evident by comments posted by confused readers who asked what jurisdictions would fall under the new law. The broad statements in the blog could leave the false impression that it refers to a federal law.
The story linked to a Feb. 1 Yahoo Lifestyle story and lifted many paragraphs from that article.
The Yahoo story stated that on Jan. 30, the Alabama state House of Representatives passed a bill to ban smoking in vehicles with any riders under the age of 19. So that means the bill itself wasn’t enacted as a law by that date -- it still has additional legislative hurdles.
However if it becomes law, Alabama would be the ninth state to do so since 2006.
There is no federal law -- or proposed federal legislation -- prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children. Alabama is one of 12 states that are considering similar bills this session, said Liz Williams, project manager for Americans for Nonsmokers’ rights.
The blog included a few sentences describing of the type of vehicles that it applies to, which closely mirrored the wording of an announcement in July 2015 by the government of the United Kingdom, which banned smoking in cars with children effective Oct. 1, 2015.
The lovethispic blog appears to recycle a similar story from 2016 , Snopes found.
We emailed the lovethispic blog and did not hear a reply. The headline ""smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018"" is misleading because it could lead readers to believe that a national ban started in January. In reality, the Alabama House did pass such a ban on Jan. 30, but it’s not state law yet.",0,LoveThisPic.com

This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline.
Your News Wire largely drew from a story by The True Pundit about Page’s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from ""federal sources"" and ""well-placed FBI sources.""
The True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ""assets"" had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 ""missing"" emails.
In 2016, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.
Despite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, Trump said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone ""sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.""
Page, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump text messages while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI's Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert’s Mueller’s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12.
We don’t have access to Page’s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn’t answer reporters’ questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little. However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media , none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese.
Conservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn’t indicate that she blamed China, either.
The Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Page denied bias.
Several right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China. We sent an email to Your News Wire and did not get a reply.
PolitiFact evaluates information using on-the-record sources and information as of the time that a person or website makes a claim. At the time of this fact-check, we found no on-the-record credible information that Page blamed the hacking on the Chinese.",0,YourNewsWire.com
"""We have more coal reserves in the United States than they have oil reserves in Saudi Arabia."" In the Republican debate on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Rudy Giuliani was asked a question about global warming. He said he would address the problem in part by supporting alternative fuel sources such as coal.
""We need to expand the use of clean coal,"" he said. ""Carbon sequestration is expensive, but it's a process that works. We have more coal reserves in the United States than they have oil reserves in Saudi Arabia.""
Giuiliani's comparison is accurate.
According to the U.S. Energy Department, the United States has 267.3-billion short tons of coal reserves, or 26.8 percent of the world total. Saudi Arabia has about 20 percent of the world's oil reserves.",1,Rudy Giuliani
"""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together."" During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Hillary Clinton decried gun violence, especially as it impacts young African-Americans.
""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together,"" she said.
This is a claim Clinton has made before , and it’s accurate.
We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form , we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014:
There were 2,256 gun-related homicides in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct.
If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.
There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.
We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.
That said, we think using the definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order."" A hoax circulating on the Internet claims that President Donald Trump had enough with billionaire liberal George Soros and contacted Russia for a file on him.
""Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order,"" stated a Jan. 30 headline on the Conservative Daily Post .
There is no evidence that Trump took any such action against Soros. The same story has been picked up by multiple websites .
The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him ""a con artist and would-be dictator."" At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, ""I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world.""
Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville . Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator .
In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action.
That executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security.
Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in ""Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists,"" the National Post reported in 2015.
In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine .
Adrian Karatnycky , an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine.
""He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement,"" he said. ""His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine.""
We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it ""thrives on independent journalism and truth;"" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence. We found no proof that Trump declared Obama a ""national security threat.""",0,Conservative Daily Post
"""Six justices"" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been ""confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."" In a Medium post titled, "" It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job ,"" Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., urged senators to hold a vote on President Barack Obama ’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland .
Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Senate Republicans have so far held firm in saying they will not vote on the nomination until the public weighs in after Election Day 2016.
Democrats counter that this is out of step with Senate norms, and they have created a graphic to make that case. ""Let’s give President Obama’s #SCOTUSnominee a fair hearing and timely vote,"" the graphic says.
At the top of Honda’s March 16 Medium post is a graphic created by the House Democratic Caucus.
Under the title, ""6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912,"" the graphic shows photographs of all six justices who fit that description. Is it accurate?
Of the six examples cited in the graphic going back to 1912, five were both nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year. They are summarized in the following chart. (We’ve corrected the spelling of Clarke’s name, which is incorrect in the Democrats’ graphic).
The sixth case involves a future justice who was nominated prior to an election year but was confirmed during one. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who’s still on the court, was confirmed in February 1988, but President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated him in November 1987 to succeed the retiring Louis Powell.
It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved.
Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.)
Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated.
Finally, in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a ""recess appointment"" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957.",1,Mike Honda
"Says Shaquille O’Neal said Donald Trump ""is possibly the best president."" A story on the website Pro Conservative News snatched a compliment about President Donald Trump from the mouth of U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch and said it came from basketball star Shaquille O’Neal.
The Dec. 10 headline includes an awkwardly worded alleged quote by the basketball star: ""Shaquille O’Neal says: ‘Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...’
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that O’Neal made that statement.
The story started with a quote by Hatch that Trump had ""been one of the best presidents"" he ever served under.
That was followed by a supposed quote by O’Neal:
""I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under. And the reasoning is, he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the -- the big mouths around here.""
In reality, a video of Hatch showed that he was the one who made that statement after he was asked about Trump’s tweets in November. (Hatch, a Utah Republican, announced Jan. 2 that he will not seek re-election.)
We did find real examples of O’Neal talking about Trump optimistically. Before the 2016 election, O’Neal referred to Trump as his friend but suggested he tweak his language.
""I think if he could reword some of the things he says and put it in business form, it would really make sense,"" O’Neal said, according to a video posted in 2015. ""Donald is like a straight-up guy.""
In November 2016 after Trump won, O’Neal said on TNT that ""everyone was in shock"" about the outcome but that he hoped Trump would bring people together.
""It’s kind of hard to believe that a guy with no political experience is the president of the United States,"" O’Neal said, calling for the public to give Trump a chance to do his job.
We sent a message to Pro Conservative News on Facebook and did not get a reply.
The headline stated that O’Neal said Trump ""is possibly the best president."" This fake news story appeared to take a quote from Hatch and attribute it to O’Neal. It was Hatch who said of Trump ""he’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under.""",0,Pro Conservative News
"""On Oct. 7, the Access Hollywood tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails."" So many extraordinary things happened in the 2016 presidential campaign that it can be hard sometimes to remember the sequence of events.
When Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman described the events of Oct. 7, 2016, during a post-election interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, we had to rewind the clock.
""On Oct. 7, the Access Hollywood tape comes out. One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails,"" Podesta told Chuck Todd on Dec. 18, 2016. ""One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.""
The Access Hollywood tape Podesta referenced showed Donald Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview . ""I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,"" Trump tells interviewer Billy Bush. ""You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""
The tape was discovered and first published by the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold right around 4 p.m. ET on Oct. 7. Fahrenthold shared a link to his story on Twitter.
Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks revealed that it had received 50,000 of Podesta’s emails. It released 2,050 initially. It, too, shared the news via Twitter.
We authenticated the time of each tweet using the Twitter source code and this very helpful blog post. We obviously cannot assess if the two events were connected, as Podesta suggested, but on the timeline he’s right on.
Here's how Time described the events in an article published that day.
""The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.""

"The stimulus bill contains ""$20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers"" and ""$25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs."" In a speech on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2009, Republican Rep. Mike Pence sounded off about what's in the stimulus bill before Congress.
""In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track,"" Pence said. ""And, it was exactly that kind of wasteful government spending that resulted in unanimous Republican opposition last week.""
We wanted to check to see if the bill includes the money Pence mentioned. Some of our previous reports have shown that opponents of the bill have not been completely truthful about what's in the bill.
In this case, Pence is right.
The Senate report on the bill, as of this writing, includes $20 million ""for the removal of small- to medium-sized fish passage barriers,"" which means clearing barriers in rivers and streams to allow fish migration. It's part of an overall $190 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat restoration projects that ""accomplish ecological goals and provide employment opportunities in the local communities.""
The report also says the projects can be modified to ""achieve the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources.""
Similarly, the $25 million for recreation maintenance, ""especially for rehabilitation of off-road vehicle routes,"" is part of an overall $135 million for the Bureau of Land Management, which includes funding for trail maintenance, remediation for environmental and public safety hazards on public lands, and habitat restoration. This passage also allows for modification for ""the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources.""
A Democratic spokesman defended the funding when we asked about Pence's criticism.
""Preserving our national parks and preserving our wildlife don't seem to be unreasonable goals,"" said Rob Blumenthal, a Democratic spokesman for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. ""These are ready-to-go jobs that will employ American workers.""
The Fish and Wildlife Service said the work to remove fish barriers is ""shovel ready"" and includes projects like building bypasses around large dams and demolishing obsolete mill runs that date back to colonial times.
""There's going to be a lot of work for local contractors,"" said Fish and Wildlife spokesman Chris Tollefson. ""We're talking about restoring native fish runs all over the country.""
We'll let others decide if the projects are worthy or not. We should point out that almost any job the government pays someone to do is technically stimulating the economy by creating income and reducing unemployment, if only by the smallest amount. Also, the two projects combined account for not even 1 percent of the bill — more like .005 percent.
Nevertheless, $45 million for most people is serious money. When he made his remarks, Pence had his facts straight on what was in the legislation — $20 million for fish-barrier removal and $25 million for off-road trails. We rule his statement True.",1,Mike Pence
"""Chinese restaurant in Coral Springs, Fla., busted for selling dog meat to VIP customers."" Fake news websites continue to share an unappetizing hoax about a Chinese restaurant serving dog meat to customers, despite local police denying the claim.
""Chinese restaurant in Coral Springs, Fla., busted for selling dog meat to VIP customers,"" read a Dec. 21, 2016, headline on a post at MajorThoughts.com. It included a disturbing photo overprinted with ""Yamstar.com,"" purporting to show cooked canines being butchered.
Facebook flagged the article as being potentially fake as part of its efforts to root out fake news on the website. This unpalatable tale certainly qualifies.
The story, rife with odd punctuation and capitalization, claimed that an eatery called China Chow had been serving dogs slaughtered in the back of the restaurant as a special-order menu item for customers who asked for it.
The article said police shut the restaurant down after a two-month investigation following a customer complaint, according to a faux department spokesman.
For all the dog lovers out there, take heart that none of these things happened. A Coral Springs Police Department employee told PolitiFact that nothing about the story is true.
Community Involvement Coordinator Lynne Martzall said there was no two-month investigation by the department, and the police spokesman named in the story is not a real person.
Furthermore, there is no restaurant named China Chow in Coral Springs, and there is no Chinese restaurant at the intersection named in the fake story.
(We did notice that there is a fictional Yelp profile of China Chow , but it only links back to the same story, published the same day on GummyPost.com .)
After receiving complaints, the department had posted a message on its Facebook page in December to tell the public the story was totally contrived. Martzall said Facebook removed the post from the department’s page after police reported the story as fake.

"Says Donald Trump warned outgoing Ghana President against last-minute job appointments. Globetrotting fake news aimed to parlay Donald Trump’s name into advertising clicks recently. A website called USA Radio crafted some imaginary thoughts from the incoming American president about the departing president of Ghana.
Under the headline ""Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President,"" the faux article said, ""Talking to the New York Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections.""
It then continued with this purported quote:
""As an outgoing president, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming president. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately.""
Facebook users flagged this for vetting as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stymie fake news.
Needless to say, there is no New York Times article quoting Trump as saying this, nor did a search of the Nexis news database uncover any time when Trump spoke about Ghana. A search of the ICANN Whois registry failed to identify the website's operator.
Since the December elections in Ghana drew modest press coverage in the United States, a bit of background is in order.
Ghana emerged from a military-controlled government in 1992 and since that time has established itself as a stable democracy. Residents of the West African nation went to the polls in early December 2016. Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President Mahama by a million votes. Akufo-Addo took office Jan. 7, 2017, making this the third peaceful handoff from one ruling party to another.
Mahama’s administration was marred by charges of corruption, and frequent breakdowns of the electric grid that left homes and businesses in darkness. On top of that, Afrobarometer , an internationally backed public opinion project, found that more Ghanaians trusted Akufo-Addo's party to control inflation and boost jobs.
The invented quote from Trump referred to Mahama’s post-election appointments for several key anti-corruption jobs in the government. The slots had been vacant for over a year and the move sparked pushback from some newly elected lawmakers.

"""The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged."" A reader asked us to check a dramatic statistic on income inequality from President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill.
""The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged,"" Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech.
When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, a spokesman pointed us to a study published in late 2011 by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budget-analysis arm of Congress.
The study looked at income trends between 1979 and 2007 for various income levels, including the top 1 percent.
CBO found that over that period, the top 1 percent’s inflation-adjusted, after-tax income rose by a cumulative 275 percent. Over 28 years, that averages to almost a 10 percent increase each year.
That’s not quite quadrupling -- a 300 percent increase would have been a quadrupling -- but Obama did say ""nearly quadrupled,"" and we think that qualifies.
As for Obama’s claim that the ""typical family’s incomes barely budged,"" that seems on target, too.
For the 60 percent of the population in the middle of the income scale -- that is, excluding the top one-fifth and the bottom one-fifth of earners -- the cumulative growth in inflation-adjusted, after-tax household income was just under 40 percent. That may sound like a healthy increase, but it actually averages to just 1.4 percent per year.
While an income increase of 1.4 percent a year above inflation does mean the middle 60 percent advanced economically during the period studied, the increase was only about one-seventh as fast as it was for the top 1 percent. In this context, we think the description ""barely budged"" is reasonable.
We should point out that the CBO’s findings about the top 1 percent were a little different than the conclusions we drew in a previous fact-check . But there’s a good reason why.
We calculated that income for the top 1 percent grew between 1979 and 2008 by 169 percent, well below the 275 percent the CBO found. Our calculation was based on data compiled by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who are specialists in income inequality.
However, the Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains. Capital gains refers to income earned from investments such as stocks, and the lion's share of the nation’s capital gains go to the very wealthy. The CBO data, unlike the data from Piketty and Saez, included capital gains income, so that explains the discrepancy.",1,Barack Obama
"""Tens of billions of dollars (from taxpayer-funded bailouts) ... flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks."" Amid all the furor over retention bonus payments to AIG employees, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chair of the House Republican caucus, said another outrage in the AIG bailout saga isn't getting enough attention.
""And the other unreported story today is tens of billions of dollars that flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks,"" Pence said in an interview on MSNBC on March 17. ""You know, the American people are frustrated with this.""
To date, American taxpayers are $170 billion into AIG bailout as part of an effort to save the global insurance conglomerate from a collapse that many fear would have a catastrophic effect on the U.S. and global economies. But for months, AIG refused to say where that bailout money was going. Under mounting pressure from Congress, on March 15 AIG finally released the names of financial institutions that benefited from the rescue money.
Although U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got the lion's share of payouts, the list also included a number of big foreign banks: Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which each received nearly $12 billion; Barclays of Britain, $8.5 billion; and UBS of Switzerland, $5 billion. In all, corporations in France and Germany got nearly $36 billion; and all foreign companies got nearly $60 billion.
So Pence is right, tens of billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars certainly flowed to foreign corporations and banks.
But what did people expect? asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. AIG is a global company, indeed the largest insurance company in the world.
Remember, Foster said, ""the reason that AIG was taken over by the federal government was to prevent it from going into bankruptcy."" It had a number of contractual obligations to both U.S. and foreign firms that it could not meet.
""If (AIG executives) had made the decision that they were only going to pay U.S. companies, the foreign companies would have gone to court and put AIG in backruptcy,"" Foster said. ""And the whole point was to keep them out of bankruptcy.""
""It’s understandable that people would be mad that taxpayer dollars would go to a place that you might not want it to go, to foreign corporations,"" he said. ""(But) the only reason to give money to AIG was to close out its contracts. Some of those contracts are with foreign corporations.""
Pence isn't saying AIG should only have used taxpayer money to pay off obligations to U.S. companies. Pence doesn't think American taxpayers should have been paying for a bailout at all.
Pence opposed the first rescue plan last fall, despite the urgings of President Bush and many key Republican leaders. Although a number of Republicans supported the bailout — enough for it to pass handily — Pence noted this week that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against it.
""The American people have had it,"" Pence said in a news conference on March 17. ""They want this Congress to get back to fiscal discipline and restraint and the belief that the freedom to succeed includes the freedom to fail. We have got to bring this country back, this business community back to the notion of personal responsibility and accountability for one's actions.""
There are reasoned arguments on both sides of whether Congress ought to have committed billions of taxpayer dollars to bailing out the troubled AIG. But the fact is, one of the consequences of infusing AIG with taxpayer cash to help it pay off its financial obligations was that tens of billions of that money went to foreign companies. We rule Pence's statement True.",1,Mike Pence
"""Obama orders ban on Christmas cards to military."" President Barack Obama has not banned Americans from sending Christmas cards to soldiers stationed overseas, despite claims in a viral post manipulated to resemble a Fox News report.
The website tdtalliance.com , whose design crudely mimics Fox News’s website , posted an article Dec. 12 headlined, ""War on Christmas: Obama orders ban on Christmas cards to military."" The article said Obama issued the executive order out of concern that Christmas cards would offend Muslims in the nations where soldiers are deployed.
But tdtalliance.com is not affiliated with Fox News. And the article is 100 percent fiction.
First of all, a search of all of Obama’s executive orders shows that he never issued an order banning Christmas cards to the military.
In fact, the 2016 White House holiday website prompts visitors to send a USO e-card to members of the military. One of the pre-written message options is, ""We are grateful for all you do. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!""
The tdtalliance.com article quotes a Hyman Stratcher, litigation director at the Liberty Institute. The Liberty Institute is a real right-wing advocacy group based in Texas, but Stratcher is a made-up person. (The institute’s real head of litigation is named Hiram Sasser .)
The article also quotes Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition, and neither the person nor the organization are real.
Finally, the article includes an image that has been edited to look like an on-air Fox News report featuring anchor Martha MacCallum , captioned, ""Obama orders ban on all Christmas cards to overseas servicemen. Pentagon to censor all outgoing mail that appears to be Christmas themed.""
While Fox has published numerous stories about the so-called ""War on Christmas,"" they did not run this fabricated story about banning Christmas cards.
Side note: In researching this fact-check, we came across a 2013 Fox article that says a Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas refused to accept cards that say ""Merry Christmas."" However, that article is misleading because it does not explain that a VA chaplain reviews and distributes Christmas cards to veterans who want to receive cards with a religious message.
It’s also worth noting that Tdtalliance.com posted the same article in 2015. Our friends at Snopes debunked it back then, too.
This article claiming that Obama issued an executive order that bans sending Christmas cards to overseas soldiers is fake news, designed to deceive.",0,Tdtalliance.com
"""More women are graduating from college now than men."" The Senate race between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, is turning out to be one of the most closely watched and expensive in recent years. Given that his opponent is portraying him as anti-woman, McConnell’s recent comments on women’s issues to a group of Kentucky voters were bound to attract media attention.
McConnell was speaking at Fastline Publications, which produces catalogs for farm equipment. When an audience member asked him about ""the most important issues facing Kentucky women,"" McConnell said , ""We’ve come a long way"" and added that ""most of the barriers have been lowered.""
""I think virtually everything I have mentioned today applies to both genders equally,"" McConnell said. ""We’ve come a long way with pay equity. There are a ton of women CEO’s now running major companies, and more women are graduating from college now than men."" He also said he received 50 percent of the women’s vote the last time he was elected, and he cited Xerox as an example of a company with a woman CEO.
After the event, McConnell received criticism from some liberal commentators for his comments that workplace sexism and inequality between the sexes was a thing of the past.
Some of his claims are too subjective to fact-check. But we decided to look at his claim that ""more women are graduating from college now than men.""
According to a study by the Pew Research Center, women have outpaced men in pursuing postsecondary education in recent years, partly because of a growing acceptance of women in a wider variety of jobs, meaning that ""the benefits of a college education grew more for women than men.""
The Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization that produces information for academic and research purposes, published a study that validated McConnell’s comments. ""Simply put, young women are now more likely to enroll in, and graduate from, college than young men,"" Kevin Pollard wrote . The graph below, which was included in Pollard’s analysis, shows the percentage of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 29 with a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Throughout the 1970s, the chart shows, men graduated from college at higher rates than women did. However, that trend reversed in the early 1990s, when women began to outpace men. And since then, this pattern for bachelor’s degrees has held steady. In 2012 women earned 1,025,729 bachelor’s degrees, or 57 percent of all degrees conferred that year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal office.
Women also earned a majority of master’s degrees and doctoral degrees in the 2011-12 academic year. Women received 60 percent of all master’s degrees, compared with 40 percent for men. In doctoral studies the margin was narrower, with 51 percent of PhDs being awarded to women and 49 percent being given to men.
Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, provided PolitiFact with a wide variety of support for McConnell’s claim, including an op-ed written by President Barack Obama for the 40th anniversary of Title IX, a statute that banned discrimination in educational programs on the basis of sex.
""In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men,"" Obama said in the article. So Obama’s comments square with those made by McConnell last week -- though they draw different conclusions. Obama’s concludes that ""there are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make,"" while McConnell said ""most of the barriers have been lowered.""",1,Mitch McConnell
"The HIV virus has been ""detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus."" Fake news is bananas by nature, but one particularly slippery claim is actually about bananas said to be infected with HIV.
""HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus,"" reads the headline on a post we first saw on Feb. 6, 2017, from a website called CNNews3.com . Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stamp out fabricated news stories.
The fake story, which is undated, said eight children younger than 17 had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS in the month of March (it doesn’t say in which year). All eight allegedly ate bananas purchased at a Tulsa, Okla., Walmart store, with the boy in the headline developing symptoms within a week. The text falsely says Walmart stores are recalling bananas nationwide.
The post included a contrived photo (shown above) featuring a red-streaked banana. The screenshot is made to resemble a breaking news alert from CNN.
But the website is not the real CNN, and there is no epidemic of HIV-infected bananas. The story is instead a symptom of a long-running online infection of fake news stories about disease-ridden fruit.
CNNews3.com is filled with several obviously untrue posts about libidinous gorillas and dubious Big Mac ingredients made up to look like news reports, as well as other headlines that could be construed as real without any indication otherwise. The site’s administrators did not answer our attempts to contact them, but it’s obvious that CNNews3.com is attempting to masquerade as the cable news giant with a similar name.
For the record, HIV can’t survive outside the human body, so it’s not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections.
Here’s what is true: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that the virus cannot be spread by food . ""Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus,"" the CDC says.
This particular fake story is a variation on an Internet hoax that has been around for a few years . One version said the World Health Organization issued a warning about bananas being infected with HIV in India . Another said the South African government warned its citizens of a similar problem , then took down warnings to avoid a panic.
This particular strain of the story can plausibly be traced back to one Facebook user’s photos of red-streaked bananas in November 2015. User Anna Aquavia claimed that her friend’s sister bought bananas in Nebraska that had been injected with HIV-positive blood.
The photos are now gone, but you can see them at this Washington Post story . The Post credited the images to a Colorado woman named Amanda Andrys, who said Del Monte told her the red streaks were from a bacteria-induced disease called mokillo.
Mokillo is more colorfully known as finger-tip rot , and can be a problem for banana growers . The disease doesn’t harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment.
Once we peeled back the layers on this story, it was obviously a fake.",0,CNNews3.com
"""Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution."" Rumors have spread that a fake court ordered former President Barack Obama to pay $400 million in restitution fees back to the American people.
""Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution,"" reads the headline on Daily World Update, a blog site claiming to produce fictitious material and conservative satire.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The article cites the nonexistent West Texas Federal Appeals Court as ordering Obama to repay the $400 million. While there is a federal court serving the Western district of Texas, it is not an appeals court, and there is no official court that matches the name of the one mentioned in the story.
The judges named in the fake news article are also made up. They listed Gary Jones, Amanda Perry and Kris Weinshenker as the primary judges who handled the case. When searching for them, we found no results of anyone by these names who serve in legal or judicial practices.
The story attributed quotes to the fake judges accusing Obama of having done incomparable economic damage to the United States and evaluating the outcome of the restitution fees.
The story claims the $400 million fees come from money that was ""lost"" in an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners.
We suspect the reference comes from a $400 million payment made to Iran in 2016 for that amount which was part of a $1.7 billion settlement. PolitiFact fact-checked claims that this payment was a ""ransom"" deal when Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States on the same day that the payment was transferred by cash to Iran.
The initial $400 million has been owed to Iran since 1979 when Iran purchased American fighter jets which the U.S. didn’t deliver following the Islamic Revolution. The payment is actually part of a $1.7 billion payment, in which an additional $1.3 billion serves as interest.",0,Daily World  Update
"""Idaho mother sentenced to prison after multiple citations for breastfeeding in public."" A fabricated story that says an Idaho mother was imprisoned for breastfeeding her child continues to be persistently shared online, despite being completely made up.
""Idaho mother sentenced to prison after multiple citations for breastfeeding in public,"" reads the headline on a Sept. 3, 2016, post on TheSeattleTribune.com, which sometimes is shared with an AssociatedMediaCoverage.com url. Even though the story is months old, it continues to be shared widely on Facebook, which flagged it as part of its efforts to combat fake news.
The story — which again, is not true — says that 32-year-old Heather Watson of Baker County, Idaho, was sentenced to seven years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender for breastfeeding her 6-month-old daughter in public. The post said Watson had received six citations for indecent exposure before landing in prison.
There is no outward indication the story is fake, but several clues should tip off readers this is a work of fiction.
There are no other news reports of this incident, beyond blog posts from incensed mothers. There also is no record of a Heather Watson at the Idaho Department of Correction offender search . (We doubt the story is about the British tennis player of the same name .)
The main photo used on the story is from a 2014 post on a Flickr account , with a chyron added to make it look like a screen grab from TV news. The inset mug is of a woman arrested in Maricopa County, Ariz., in 2016 .
Another giveaway is the location mentioned in the story: There is no Baker County in Idaho . There’s further reference to a location called Wiser, Idaho, but the town is spelled Weiser , and it’s in Washington County.
There’s also a phone number given as a way to contact the judge in the case at the fictional Baker County Department of Justice. When called, the phone number identifies itself as a voicemail service for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan.
The story likely keys off Idaho’s distinction as being the only state without a law specifically defending breastfeeding in public (although there is a law excusing nursing mothers from jury duty ).
The post links to a MoveOn.org petition supporting a new law, and there is a graphic illustrating where in the United States it is legal to breastfeed in public, taken from a 2014 Huffington Post article .
Many Idahoans support a new law protecting mothers from being kicked out of businesses or charged with public indecency. The state reportedly has a higher rate of breastfeeding mothers than any other state.
In 2016, Miss Idaho America Christi Van Ravenhorst teamed up with a group called the Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition to push for a bill, and mothers staged a ""nurse-in"" on the steps of the state Capitol.
The headline on this post, meanwhile, continues to draw the ire of breastfeeding supporters with its fake details.",0,TheSeattleTribune.com
"""We are making the largest investment in education in our nation’s history."" As President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus bill, he said it marked a historic investment in education.
""Because we know America can't outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today, we're making the largest investment in education in our nation's history,"" Obama said at a bill signing ceremony at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science on Feb. 17, 2009.
That's quite a claim — the largest ever?
It's true that a substantial chunk of the stimulus is targeted to education. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in this press release that the bill ""provides more than $100 billion in education funding and college grants and tuition tax credits, as well as billions more for school modernization.""
This chart from the Wall Street Journal indicates $115 billion of the $787 billion goes to education in one way or another. That includes, among other things, $22 billion for school construction and repair, $41 billion for states to balance education budgets, $650 million for computer and science labs, $17 billion for Pell Grants, and $14 million for Education Department spending oversight (which we dare say seems like money well spent in light of what precedes it). That money will be spent over the next two years, a spokesman told us.
For Obama to even be in the ballpark of being the largest ever, we have to assume that he was comparing the funding to prior spending by the   federal  government exclusively. It's important to realize that the vast majority of money spent on education in this country is spent by states and localities. Of the money spent at the elementary and secondary level, over 91 percent comes from nonfederal sources, according to the Education Department. Even $115 billion won't change that balance substantially.
So we'll assume that Obama meant the largest single investment by the federal government.
As we look back on the history of federal education funding, we find no single effort comes close, even after adjusting for inflation.
The New Deal contained little in the way of education spending. After the Soviet Union succeeded in placing the   Sputnik 1  satellite in orbit, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to bolster math and science education — but that was a modest program by today's standards. Lyndon B. Johnson dramatically increased federal support for education with the Great Society programs, persuading Congress to pass the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965, the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1965 and Project Head Start. Those efforts marked a turning point in federal support for education, but experts in education budgeting told us they received just a few billion dollars — very little compared to today's education spending, even before the stimulus.
For example, the Elementary and Secondary School Act was funded with $1.3 billion initially, according to the book   Depression to Cold War  , which amounts to around $9 billion in current dollars. Head Start received less than $1 billion.
These programs have grown over time, so that the real competition to Obama's stimulus spending, several experts said, comes from the Education Department's annual budget from recent years. As this chart shows, it has risen steadily over the past 30 years, from $13.1 billion in 1980 (in 2007 dollars) to $23.2 billion in 1990 to $34.1 billion in 2000 to $73 billion in 2007.
Tom Skelly, director of budget service at the Education Department, said via e-mail that the stimulus money is ""in addition to our 2009 regular appropriation that will be over $59 billion. So in the department alone, we will have about $160 billion in discretionary appropriations.""
That's far higher than the department's budget has ever been. Other departments in the federal government also spend money on education through scholarship programs, school lunches and the like, amounting to total federal spending of about $170 billion a year. But there's no reason to believe those other programs won't continue this year as well, pushing total federal education spending to new heights.
""It is the largest federal investment in education,"" Skelly wrote of the stimulus money, standing behind Obama's claim.
It does appear that the stimulus money will push federal spending on education — both within the Education Department and across the federal government as a whole — higher than it has ever been.",1,Barack Obama
"Says ""President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!"" A headline on an article posted on several websites falsely declares that President Donald Trump has made English the language of the land.
""Breaking! President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!"" the headline reads.
It’s obvious in the story that follows, which discusses changes on the White House website, that something was lost in translation.
We first saw the headline on DonaldTrumpPOTUS45.com on Jan. 26, 2017 , but it has appeared on other sites in subsequent days . Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat fake news in user feeds.
First off, English may be the de facto language of the United States, but the country has no designated official language. A majority of states do have laws making English their official language, albeit to varying degrees.
Trump also did not elevate English in any official capacity, although he has certainly made it clear he would prefer citizens (including fluent Spanish speaker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ) speak it.
""Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English,"" Trump said at a 2015 news conference . ""I think that, while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English.""
This is a prime example of a certain type of fake news story that spins news of a real event, then slaps a provocative and largely unrelated headline on it in an attempt to draw eyeballs.
In this case, the body of the story clearly advocates for adopting English as an official language, and says Trump should do so. But the only news event alluded to is about the official White House website losing its Spanish translation after Trump was inaugurated.
The post cites an article from the Los Angeles Times, which points out the translation option had been removed from WhiteHouse.gov on Jan. 20 . As of Feb. 9, the Spanish translation of the White House website was still gone.
The story making the rounds on the Internet, meanwhile, says Trump purposely directed his administration to remove the translation.
Even if that were true — and there’s no solid evidence that’s the case — it’s far from making English the nation’s official language. That would require legislation through Congress, which has been proposed in the past but never became law.
This incendiary headline woefully misrepresents the actual event to which it is tied.",0,Bloggers
"A ""fairly limited number of people, 25 million to 30 million,"" will be allowed to access a national health insurance exchange. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., appeared on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  to discuss health care reform and the concerns of moderate Democrats that it not add to the deficit.
McCaskill said she supported a public option for health insurance and believed that it would end up as part of the final plan.
The public option would be one plan among many private plans available on a health insurance exchange, she said.
""Keep in mind, not everybody can even go to this exchange and buy insurance with any kind of subsidy. This is going to be a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer.""
We were interested in McCaskill's statement because we've been following the legislation to see who would be allowed onto the exchange.
To go over a few health care reform basics: The Democratic plans would leave in place the current system of private insurance, which covers a majority of Americans. The plans would also increase regulation for insurance companies, require everyone to buy health insurance and provide more subsidies for low-income people.
People who are uninsured or work for a small business would be able to buy coverage on the exchange, which would offer a variety of plans. One aspect still up in the air is the public option, a plan on the exchange that would be run by the government. People could choose whether to enroll in the public option.
McCaskill said that only a limited number of people would be eligible to shop on the exchange, and that is the case with the proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed the committee bill and found that between 23 million and 27 million would buy insurance from the exchange by 2019. The CBO said that most of the people using the exchange would be people who buy insurance on their own in the individual market, and employees who work for small businesses. The CBO also looked at the House bill, a slightly different plan, and found that 30 million would use the exchange in 2019. (We should note that the Senate Finance Committee proposal did not include a public option, but it's expected that the full Senate will consider a public option of some type.)
Not everybody likes the limitation on who can shop on the exchange. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., for example, has been promoting an amendment that would open the exchange to people who get insurance from a large employer.
""Under the nation's current employer-based system, most people have little if any choice about where they get their insurance,"" Wyden wrote in an op-ed in the  New York Times.  ""They just have to accept the plan that comes with their job. That insurance company, in turn, is provided a captive group of customers, so it has no incentive to earn their loyalty.""
We should also note that President Barack Obama was fond of saying on the campaign trail that people could buy insurance on a new exchange ""if you don't have insurance, or don't like your insurance.""
He mentioned it as recently as June in remarks to the American Medical Association: ""Now, if you don't like your health coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance under what we've proposed to take part in what we're calling a health insurance exchange,"" Obama said to the AMA on June 15, 2009.
But that wouldn't be the case under the terms of the Senate Finance proposal, which was unveiled in September. Keep in mind that health care legislation has yet to be finalized, so we'll be keeping an eye on this provision.
Getting back to McCaskill's remark, she said that it would be ""a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer."" The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the Senate bill and pegged it at 23 million to 27 million by 2019, slightly less than the 30 million the CBO estimated under the House bill. Roughly speaking, that's less than 10 percent of the U.S. population. McCaskill is off by just a little bit on the Senate version and on the money for the House bill.",1,Claire McCaskill
"""BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio"" An alarming headline stated there was a sudden massive death wave in Ohio, but the facts show there was no one-day wipeout.
""BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio,"" said the May 13 headline on True American, a website with a lot of clickbait headlines. The story is a ripoff of the same misleading stories that appeared in June 2017 on multiple websites.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The headline could lead viewers to believe there was a sudden one-day death toll in Ohio, but the story actually refers to ongoing deaths from opioids in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located.
""The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in,"" the story stated.
But later in the story, it said that the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner confirmed that 60 people died in February ""from the same alarming cause."" The story quoted a news report by FOX - 8 WJW (Cleveland, Ohio) about the overdose deaths.
While the True American story has a May 2018 dateline, the TV report was from March 2017 and refers to February 2017 data released by the medical examiner. The TV station reported that ""at least 60 died from heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two, bringing this year's total to 109."" The report said that the number could rise as toxicology results were received in additional cases, but the 60 deaths outpaced the previous one-month record of 57 drug fatalities in September 2016.
The data came from i nformation released by the medical examiner to the media.
Christopher Harris, a spokesman for the medical examiner, told PolitiFact that the final number for February 2017 for opioid-related deaths was 65. For all of 2017, there were 727 total drug deaths; 553 opioid related.
In 2018 so far, there have been at least 137 suspected opioid related deaths:

The headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers.
""Busted: Obama is holding secret meetings to overtake the White House,"" said a June 11, 2018, headline from Redstate Watcher, a conservative website that seeks ""to forward the Trump agenda,"" according to the about section on its Facebook page. The same story appeared on several other conservative blog sites.
Obama trying to take over the White House? It's not like that, based on what's been reported.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""Obama is continuing to break former president protocol by trying to infiltrate current administration,"" the story said, citing a report from the Washington Examiner detailing Obama’s private, one-on-one meetings with prospective Democratic presidential candidates.
The story said Obama was eager to play a role in advising leading Democrats and shaping the party’s future. The story said he has insisted that 2020 hopefuls continue framing discussions around the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because it ""sticks with voters in the long run.""
We decided to take a look at the story and see how its claim checked out. We found that its contents can be traced back to a June 11, 2018, report from Politico. (The Washington Examiner story cited Politico as its source).
But the few discrepancies between the original Politico report and the post from Redstate Watcher cast a misleading light on the latter’s narrative.
For one, the Politico report said of the Russia investigations: ""Many of the conversations have circled around Obama holding forth about how much Democrats should be heading into the midterms talking about the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election versus focusing on kitchen table issues … Think about what’s going to stick in the long term.""
The Politico story also said nothing about Obama breaking any formal or informal protocol for past presidents or attempting to ""infiltrate"" President Donald Trump’s administration. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports saying that.
Redstate Watcher responded to a Facebook message by noting that the story featured ""a clickbait title"" and criticizing readers and fact-checkers who ""pick and choose which words you feel like taking literally and which words you take figuratively.""
Obama did arrange multiple private meetings with potential Democratic presidential candidates. But the former president was never ""busted"" for working in secret to ""infiltrate"" and ""overtake"" the Trump White House.",0,Bloggers

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is similar to an earlier article by Just News USA.
We found only speculative news reports about whether the Obamas would be invited and no official reports about the guest list. We found no credible news articles which stated that the Queen struck the Obamas from the list.
The fake story said that when Michelle Obama heard that Harry was marrying a black woman (Markle is biracial) she tried to ""sneak a spot on the guest list.""
""Barack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year,"" the story said.
Ever since the couple announced their engagement in November, there have been multiple speculative news reports about who will and won’t be invited to the wedding.
Some news reports based on unnamed sources said that the couple want the Obamas at their May 19 wedding. While the royal family has been friendly with the Obamas, we found no official reports.
The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement in November, and neither mention an invite list.
On Dec. 27, while guest-editing a BBC morning radio program , Harry joked that the guest list was still a ways off.
""I don't know about that -- we haven't even put the invite or the guest list together yet. Who knows if (Obama's) going to be invited or not,"" Harry said. ""I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.""
News reports have speculated about whether Trump will be invited to the royal wedding although there is precedent for sitting U.S. presidents to not attend.
While those reports are speculative, Markle was critical of Trump before her engagement. In May 2016 while on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, Markle said Trump was ""divisive"" and ""misogynistic.""

There have been no reports that Hart was in any car accident, let alone was injured. He has been posting on social media accounts since then , which the fake post actually used in its writeup of the bogus crash.
The second half of the NYDailyNews-TV.com post went on about how Hart had confessed online the day prior about how he had made a ""bad error in judgment"" that had affected his family and made him a target of extortion.

""Man pardoned by Obama 3 months ago arrested for murder,"" read the headline on a Feb. 28, 2017, story on UndergroundNewsReport.com. Facebook flagged the story as being potentially false as part of its efforts to fight fake news in users’ feeds. The story has been shared on Facebook more than 23,000 times since being posted less than a week ago. The tale has wound up on other websites since then.
The post claims a Gainesville, Fla., man named James G. Winters was arrested for killing girlfriend Joanna Walker and leaving her body in a car trunk in Orlando. Winters, it says, was pardoned by Obama just 94 days ago, freeing him from a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges.
These details are fake, although as in many fake news stories, there are some real roots to the premise.
Obama granted 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons , the most of any president since Harry Truman. Many of these criminals were nonviolent drug offenders serving exceptionally long sentences under strict federal guidelines from decades ago.
Obama had made easing these punishments a campaign promise, and had sought to aid hundreds of people who slipped through the cracks under sentencing revisions created through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Part of Obama’s actions included granting pardons and sentence commutations. (We wrote an entire story about it, which you can read here .)
One story circulated by Obama detractors was of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who in 2016 was charged with killing a woman and her two children in Columbus, Ohio. Callahan had been freed under changes in the 2010 law, which Obama supported and signed. Callahan’s case is pending.
But Winters hadn’t been freed by Obama, either by pardon or commutation. There is no James Winters on the list of 1,927 prisoners affected by executive action. The photo on the story is of Avery Draughty, a California man convicted of killing his neighbor in 2016.
A closer look at the story UndergroundNewsReport.com shows that the site purposely writes outlandish stories to trick readers. The site contains a disclaimer that says all articles ""are fiction, and presumably fake news.""
There also is a link at the end of the story that redirects readers to an explanation that the website’s owner had created it to see if he could fool readers, specifically supporters of President Donald Trump. The article said the writer circulated his fake stories on ""Trump fan groups"" to see if they would take the bait.
""To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally,"" the author wrote. ""It seemed that there wasn’t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience.""
When we contacted him via email, the writer identified himself as James McDaniel, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen living in Costa Rica. (The site is privately registered in Scottsdale, Ariz.)
""I admit I kind of stumbled into this on accident just playing around and didn't really expect to get any attention at first,"" McDaniel wrote. ""People proved to be far more gullible than I previously thought.""

"""Application for March for Our Lives permit was made months before Parkland shooting"" An Internet hoax has spread suggesting that the student-led demonstration March for Our Lives was planned months in advance to the actual event.
""Application for ‘March for Our Lives’ permit was made months before Parkland school shooting,"" read the headline on Fellowship of the Minds, a website that pushes conspiracy theories and religious ideas.
The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School happened on Feb. 14. Since then, student survivors have made multiple media appearances and organized events promoting increased gun control. The national demonstration March For Our Lives occurred on March 24 in Washington.
An application for a permit organized by Los Angeles-based television producer and co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation, Deena Katz, was submitted on Feb. 20 .
The article cites a correspondence with D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Scott C. Earhardt as to why the march may have been planned in advance. After an apparent source of Light on Conspiracies author Ole Dammegard contacted the police department regarding the permit, they received a response from Earhardt with the following message:
""In reference to your inquiry concerning the March for Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event.""
However, when we contacted Officer Scott C. Earhardt, he said that he had mistakenly mixed up the annual D.C.-based March for Life rally that happened in January with the more recent March for Our Lives demonstration in the email.
Earhardt told PolitiFact that the story is not factual and that the permit for March for Our Lives was issued on March 13.
The misunderstanding between the two parties is likely to have increased confusion about the actual dates of when the permit was issued.
The screenshot of the email pictured in the article was credited to James Fetzer , a philosophy of science professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth who has promoted various conspiracy theories, including denying the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing and the Holocaust.
March for Our Lives was organized by the Parkland student survivors who began the Never Again movement to promote gun control. They partnered with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",0,Fellowship of the Minds
"""There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible."" During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Ted Cruz compared two volumes -- one beloved by many, the other loathed by almost everybody.
""There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible -- and -- and not a one of them is as good,"" Cruz said.
Our New Jersey affiliate checked a similar claim on length in 2013, so we’ll apply their research to Cruz’s claim here.
How long is the tax code?
A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at ""about 4 million.""
We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million.
That was two years ago, but we think it’s a safe bet that the length of the tax code has only increased since then, not decreased.
How long is the Bible?
Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary, told PolitiFact New Jersey that a fair approximation of the Bible’s length is 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined.
""The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,"" Olson said.
Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, agreed that estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words were credible.
Put it all together and the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible. So Cruz is correct.",1,Ted Cruz
"""USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes!"" A headline would have readers believe that a ship discovered at the bottom of Lake Ontario by the Coast Guard is a German submarine, but this is fake news that has circulated for years.
""USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes,"" said a May 22 headline on Cvikas . A similar story has appeared on various websites since 2016.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
The story said that amateur scuba divers first spotted the boat in January and contacted authorities. Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it.
But we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered.
The story included a photo of a rusted submarine. Snopes found in 2016 that the photo was an unrelated image of a rusting, decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era.
The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name.
The Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past.
""Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn’t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement.
ABC 7 Eyewitness News in Chicago reported in 2013 about the history of a sunken German submarine in Lake Michigan.
The German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919.
""The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, 'we won' tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk,"" Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news.
In June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military.
But in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.",0,Bloggers
"The federal government ""can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget."" During a Feb. 14, 2011, interview with Fox Business News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told anchor Andrew Napolitano that balancing the budget cannot be done without touching sacrosanct areas such as the military.
""The problem is that things are out of control, and unless you accept that you can have federal government doing less things, like unless you accept the philosophic principle that education should be handled by the states and localities, they don't know where to cut,"" Paul said. ""Or unless you accept the principle that military spending will have to be cut. They don't have enough money to cut. They can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget.""
He is making a dramatic point that even if Congress were to eliminate every non-military program except for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which are considered mandatory rather than discretionary), it still wouldn’t be enough to balance the budget.
We should emphasize the sweeping nature of ""discretionary"" spending -- that is, spending that has to be funded by Congress every year. It includes all defense and homeland security spending plus virtually every major government program other than Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. It includes everything from the National Institutes of Health to the air traffic control system to Pell Grants for college students. For this year, it includes $507 billion for non-security and $908 billion for security spending.
There are two other main elements of the federal budget: mandatory programs and interest on the debt. Mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are funded by formulas that cannot be pared back without specific action by Congress to rewrite those formulas. Interest payments are also considered mandatory.
We reviewed the latest budget figures and found that Paul is correct. If you subtract out every last penny of non-security discretionary spending and simply add together security spending, mandatory programs and interest, the government is still projected to face expenditures of $3.309 trillion for fiscal year 2011. That’s a full $1.14 trillion more than the $2.17 trillion in taxes and other income the government is expecting to collect for 2011.
So the government would have a trillion-dollar-plus deficit in 2011 even without spending anything on non-security discretionary spending.
Now, Paul did say ""non-military"" rather than ""non-security,"" which is a slightly different measurement, since the Department of Homeland Security and a few other security-related programs outside the Defense Department are categorized under the ""security"" heading. But the dollar amounts involved are not enough to make a difference in evaluating his statement.",1,Rand Paul
"""We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care."" The Catholic church and the White House have been  clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.
As we’ve noted before , the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required.
""Religious employers"" are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals don’t qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs.
In an interview with David Gregory on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills.
At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration it’s been battling.
""We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care,"" Dolan said. ""We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?""
We wondered whether the bishops’ support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century.
Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care.
During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan , published the Bishops’ Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice . Dolan was referring to a  section on social insurance , his spokesman said.
""The state,"" the guide read, ""should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age.""
That wasn’t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton’s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993.
""The flap is over the (contraception) issue,"" said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. ""That’s where it comes to appear that they’re against universal health care.""
Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years.",1,Timothy Dolan
"""NFL fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem."" A fake news story that said players for Pittsburgh’s NFL team were being fined seven figures for remaining in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner is the work of a self-described liberal troll looking to fool conservatives.
A story posted Sept. 24, 2017, on TheLastLineOfDefense.org ran with the headline, ""Breaking: NFL fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m each for skipping national anthem."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The post noted that ""everyone fell in line"" with President Donald Trump’s Twitter demand that NFL players "" stop disrespecting our Flag & Country "" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America.
The website ran an excerpt from a real ABC News story about the Steelers largely electing to not leave the locker room during the song during their Sept. 24 game against the Chicago Bears. More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism.
Then the post said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell ""announced shortly after the game began that every player who ‘protested’ the National Anthem and showed ‘immense disrespect to our nation’ would be fined a cool million dollars.""
That isn’t the case, because the article is fake.
The same story was reported in posts on many other websites , many without attribution to TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That’s important to note, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only fabricated stories.
A footer note on the bottom of the page said ""everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction."" The site’s "" about us "" page included a disclaimer that read, ""We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.""
TheLastLineOfDefense.org is the source of dozens upon dozens of fake news stories. The website is the brainchild of a man named Christopher Blair, who has told PolitiFact he writes absurd claims strictly to trick conservative readers into believing wild stories .
In this case, the website attempted to trick readers into thinking the NFL was punishing the Steelers for refusing to come onto the field for the Star-Spangled Banner.
Former Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva, who served for three tours in Afghanistan, was the only Steelers player to leave the locker room to stand for the anthem. The Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks, who played each other in Nashville, also refused to come to the sidelines for the song.
It’s not clear who wrote the Goodell story, as the author is only identified as "" Freedom ."" The author replied to an email we sent but would not provide their real name.
In reality, Goodell didn’t fine any team or player, and told Sports Illustrated he supported the teams and players .

"""Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings."" An Internet post claiming that high-ranking Chinese officials had called the American moon landing a ""complete hoax"" is a fake news story that has been in circulation for years:
A new scandal has happened after high ranking officials from the Chinese space program called the American moon landing ""a complete hoax"", the Beijing Daily Express reports.
The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldn’t find any proof of American landings on the Moon.
The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that there’s no trace of these moon landings.
The post attributes the quote to the Beijing Daily Express, a publication we found no record of. It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these ""showed no trace"" of the Apollo moon landing.
While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China’s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn’t be evidence one way or another.
""It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites,"" Jones said. ""Yutu, with designed minimum lifetime of three (Earth) months and a range of up to 10 kilometers, lasted 31 months on the Moon, but was stationary for the vast majority of this.""
The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, though, which can be seen in this database . This is the same spacecraft that the Chinese space agency used to determine Yutu’s landing site.
In addition to photographs, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that have fueled decades of scientific research, and are available upon request from NASA.
""So far, no one has seen those samples and declared them to be fake,"" director of space policy at Planetary Society Casey Dreier said.
The story also claims the Chinese space program launched a petition demanding the United States declassify NASA information regarding the U.S. moon landing, signed by 200 of its highest-ranking officials.
But the petition is nowhere to be found and alleged signee and ""world renowned nuclear engineer"" Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin is actually renowned in fake news circles as a Russian conspiracy theorist denying all moon landings. The only information available about him online, though, has been produced by Mukhin himself, leading Wikipedia to cast serious doubt on his profile.
The story can be traced back to a 2014 post on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake news that assumes ""all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.""",0,AntiNews.in
"""Trump wants to deport American Indians to India."" A fake news story contended that President Donald Trump conflated Native Americans with people actually from India, and wanted to deport them to the South Asian subcontinent.
""Trump wants to deport American Indians to India,"" read the headline on an April 25, 2017, post on ILoveNativeAmericans.us. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ feeds.
ILoveNativeAmericans.us ostensibly is a site filled with stories about or of interest to Native Americans. But there’s evidence it’s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that ""this is real, it was on TV.""
We received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in Kosovo .
The story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, ""I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.""
Also included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it’s quite easy to fake a tweet from any account , and Trump is a popular target. There’s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans.
Moreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which first posted the article on Feb. 13 .
The-Postillon.com calls itself ""honest news"" on its banner, but its FAQ section notes that ""everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up."" Unlike many parody sites, the FAQ also lists several staffers, and gives readers explicit permission to repost edited articles with attribution. The site is registered in Roubaix, France .
The story has made it onto other suspect aggregators similar to I LoveNativeAmericans.us. One version appeared on WeLoveNative.com on Feb. 28 , while it showed up (and was then removed ) on NativeAmericans.news on March 4 . Both websites also are registered to addresses in Kosovo .
There has been some concern that Trump’s immigration efforts may affect Indians in the United States — some 300,000 illegal immigrants are Indians , according to the Times of India. Possible changes in the H-1B temporary visa program also are likely to affect Indians here.
But Trump didn’t make these statements, and there’s no executive order deporting Native Americans to another country.",0,Bloggers
"""Most Americans support"" the legalization of marijuana. In a Medium post touting his Libertarian presidential candidacy, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson addressed a variety of policies in his platform, including fiscally conservative policies, criminal justice reform and caution before committing troops overseas.
He also returned to what has become one of his signature issues: the legalization of marijuana.
""In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana,"" he wrote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran for president in 2016, ""came to that viewpoint — a position that most Americans support — 16 years later.""
We wondered: Is Johnson correct that ""most Americans support"" the ""legalization of marijuana""?
We took a look at the recent polling and found that Johnson is basically on target.
It wasn’t always the case: As recently as 2005, public opinion was roughly 2-to-1 against marijuana legalization. But we found 14 polls since the beginning of 2014 that show consistent support for legalization. (The poll questions used the broad term ""legalization"" without providing specifics about how the drug would be sold or whether there would be restrictions on how it could be used.)
Here’s a full list of those 14 polls since the start of 2014, drawn from the public opinion archive PollingReport.com :
In 12 of these 14 polls, an outright majority of respondents -- 50 percent or more -- supported legalization. As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent.
Overall, if you average the 14 polls, legalization led by a 53 percent-44 percent margin.
Joe Hunter, the communications director for Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, said the ""most reliable data, when available, is derived from asking the same question over time, with the same methodology. Of the major polling organizations, Gallup is the one who has done that.""
During the time frame we looked at, Gallup asked the question twice, once finding an 18-point edge for legalization and the other time finding a four-point margin. The most recent Gallup poll before that, taken in 2013, found a 19-point lead for legalization.",1,Gary Johnson
"Minnesota imposed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law. You can still find parts of the world where blaspheming Islam is punishable by fines or even death. Minnesota, however, is not among these places.
Nevertheless, fake news sites like Political Mayhem claim Minnesota recently passed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law dressed up to look like a municipal hate crime hotline.
""It is not the way we roll in America, until now,"" reads one noxious fake news item. ""Minnesota has just established"" an anti-blasphemy law.
We decided to hose off this dumpster fire.
A hate crime hotline is not an anti-blasphemy law
Defining blasphemy is easy enough: in legal terms it’s ""any oral or written reproach maliciously cast upon God, His name, attributes, or religion.""
But it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to believe a hate crime hotline set up June 19 by the city of Minneapolis is actually an Islamic anti-blasphemy law.
First, opening a hotline is not how you make law.
Second, this hotline is not meant for suspected crimes against Muslims only.
As a statement describing the new service makes clear, reports concerning ""any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone’s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity"" are encouraged.
Third, even if this hotline were law (it’s not), anti-blasphemy laws are unenforceable in the United States because blasphemy is considered protected speech under the Constitution.
To suss out the raison d’etre of this fake news article, look no further than its inflammatory headline, which reads, ""State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down ‘Infidels.’ ""
This calculated effort to stoke Islamophobia among credulous readers at a moment when reports show anti-Muslim hate crimes have risen across the country is dangerous.",0,Bloggers

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The headline is a hoax and intended to draw in readers.
The story that followed never said that Ingraham was fired. Instead it said she ""fired off on Democrats.""
The story posted Ingraham’s April 20 tweet related to the recent Democratic National Committee lawsuit filed against President Donald Trump’s campaign, Russia and WikiLeaks alleging election interference. The DNC filed the lawsuit in federal court in New York April 20.
""My personal advice to Democrats is this: Keep doing what you're doing because the American people are a lot smarter than you give them credit for,"" Ingraham tweeted.
The conservative website sides with Ingraham.
""Democrats continue to show the American people that they have no identity and no sustaining message for their platform,"" the website said. ""2018 may not be ‘in the bag’ as they have predicted.""
In March, Ingraham took a week off as advertisers pulled out of her show following her comments about Parkland survivor David Hogg. The controversy began when she posted an article about Hogg being rejected by four colleges and said he was whining about it. She later apologized .
Fox News said at the time that her break was a pre-planned vacation. On her show, The Ingraham Angle, she said that she was spending Easter break with her children.

"""Over the past three years, ‘deep poverty’ has reached its highest level on record."" Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives recently released a study that critiqued the current mix of federal anti-poverty programs and suggested a new way forward.
The report, titled "" The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later ,"" was released by the House Budget Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan was Mitt Romney’s running mate in the 2012 election and is considered a possible presidential contender in 2016.
The report, released March 3, 2014, argues in part that there are too many overlapping and ineffective programs designed to help poor Americans.
At one point, the authors overseen by Ryan tried to give a sense of how far-reaching the problem of poverty remains, despite the investment of countless taxpayer dollars over the course of several decades.
""Over the past three years, ‘deep poverty’ has reached its highest level on record,"" the report said. A footnote noted that a household living in ""deep poverty"" is defined as one that ""makes less than 50 percent of the poverty line."" (The report isn't the first to use the term ""deep poverty"" -- other researchers have as well.)
We wondered whether this was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the official source of federal statistics on poverty.
We found a table -- "" Percent of People by Ratio of Income to Poverty Level "" -- that breaks down those who earned various percentages of the poverty line. The smallest of those ratios was half the poverty line -- the ""deep poverty"" statistic the report cited.
The federal poverty level is actually a matrix of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold. For one person in 2014, the poverty level is $11,670, and 50 percent of that works out to $5,835. For a family of four, the poverty level is $23,850, and 50 percent of that is $11,925.
The most recent data available is for 2012. That year, the Census Bureau found that 6.6 percent of Americans earned 50 percent or less of the poverty line.
It was also 6.6 percent for 2011, and it was 6.7 percent for 2010.
The table includes data going back to 1975, and the percentages were never as high as they got beginning in 2010. The highest percentage before 2010 was 6.3 percent in 2009; prior to that, it was 6.2 percent in 1993. That percentage was likely higher prior to the mid-1960s, since the poverty rate as a whole between 1959 and 1965 was between 17.3 percent and 22.4 percent, well above today's 15 percent. But before 1975, the statistic was not calculated, so we can’t know the answer for 50 percent of the poverty line for sure.
Not surprisingly, the percentage tends to rise after recessions, which explains the recent spike as well as the one in the early-1990s as well as another in the early 1980s. Prior to the most recent recession, the rate of Americans at 50 percent of poverty was 5.2 percent in both 2006 and 2007.",1,Paul Ryan
"Says ""Monica Lewinsky Found Dead"" in a burglary. Rumors of Monica Lewinsky’s death have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, she’s alive and well, and blithely shooting down Internet hoaxes claiming she was tragically killed in a burglary.
The fake news item, which alleges Lewinsky was embroiled in an ongoing affair with former President Bill Clinton until her dying day, contains a photo which purports to show the former White House intern’s lifeless body being wheeled from the murder scene on a stretcher.
The item is circulating on at least two satirical websites whose stated mission is to lure unwitting readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its inflammatory hoaxes for truth.
""We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative,"" reads a disclaimer on Freedom Crossroads, one of the spoof sites. ""Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate.

"""Five percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country. Forty percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all."" Fred Thompson, in arguing that the tax cuts of the Bush administration should be renewed, said that 5 percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country, and that 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all.
Both figures are true.
The top 5 percent of all payers do pay more than half the income tax. They pay about 59.2 percent of all individual income tax, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan institute run jointly by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
Thompson also said that 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax. This claim is supported by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group that promotes transparency in the tax code and economic growth.
There's a small caveat to the 40 percent number — it includes nonfilers, typically taxpayers who don't have to file returns because their incomes are too low. It's logical to assume that most nonfilers don't pay income taxes, but it's possible that some did if they had income taxes withheld by an employer. This is probably a very small number, because people with low incomes have an economic incentive to file a return and get a refund.
The U.S. income tax system is progressive, which means that rates increase as income increases. Given that structure, it makes sense that people with higher incomes pay more taxes, and people with low incomes might pay no tax at all.",1,Fred Thompson
"Says Keanu Reeves gave a speech that began, ""I cannot be part of a world where men dress their wives as prostitutes by showing everything that should be cherished ..."" A lengthy quote attributed to Keanu Reeves doesn’t appear to have come from the actor at all, but rather a fan page for him on Facebook.
The rambling quote admonishes essentially anyone who mistreats, objectifies, ignores, takes advantage of or otherwise abuses someone else:
""I cannot be part of a world where men dress their wives as prostitutes by showing everything that should be cherished,"" the diatribe began. ""Where there is no concept of honor and dignity, and one can only rely on those when they say ‘I promise.’ Where women do not want children, and men don’t want a family. Where the suckers believe themselves to be successful behind the wheel of their fathers’ cars, and a father who has a little bit of power is trying to prove to you that you’re a nobody.""
And on and on; In other words, be excellent to each other . You can read it all for yourself, but we first saw the quote in an April 26, 2017, post on BestThings.us . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fabricated news.
The same quote has appeared on several other websites , going back to 2016 , always attributed to Reeves . It even appeared on an English-language Pakistani newspaper’s website.
We also found the quote attributed to him in a Russian-language video that appears to show him saying it (we used the translated captions) — but it actually shows him talking about a Paul Gauguin exhibit in Switzerland. Another video example used a computerized voice to recite the quote.
It’s also appeared on Facebook. And we mean, it’s appeared all over Facebook , again credited to Reeves.
But while that seems like a deep message from the guy who played John Wick , we can’t find any record of Reeves saying it.
As best we can tell, the quote’s association with Reeves came from a Facebook fan page called ""Keanu Reeves - the actor."" The page posted the quote, wherever they got it from, on Feb. 21, 2016. The page’s About section said Reeves was allowed to post on the page or moderate as he saw fit. There was no contact information.
But Reeves’ publicist, Cheryl Maisel of talent agency PMK-BNC , said the actor had no affiliation with the page.
""Keanu does not participate in any form of social media,"" she said via email. ""This Facebook page is fake.""
Maisel told us she had the entire fan page removed from Facebook.
It wouldn’t be the first time a famous person was misquoted on the Internet , of course. And Reeves knows a little something about being on the Internet .
But he wasn’t The One who made this protracted speech.",0,Bloggers
"""In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,"" but it’s still only ""19 percent."" Hillary Clinton is running to become the first female president in American history. But even as she makes her potentially historic run, the number of women in Congress remains far from parity with men, said Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine.
""In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the Federal legislature, 19 percent,"" said Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia. ""That's the best job we've ever done. Hold on for this, folks: Nineteen percent ranks the United States 75th in the world, below the global average. Iraq is 26 percent. Afghanistan, 28 percent. Number one? Rwanda, 64 percent.""
We wondered if Kaine is correct that ""in Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,"" but it’s still only ""19 percent.""
First, let’s look at the 19 percent number.
According to the World Bank , which cites data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 19 percent figure is right on for 2015. The U.S. figure has remained at 19 percent in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union data , which is current through June 2016.
Specifically, in 2016, there are 104 women serving in both chambers of Congress, comprising 19.4 percent of the 535 combined members. (In all, 76 are Democrats and 28 are Republicans.)  Chamber by chamber, 20 women serve in the Senate, accounting for 20 percent of all members in the chamber, and 84 women serve in the House, accounting for 19.3 percent.
Is 19 percent the highest in United States history?
As it turns out, Kaine is correct on that point, too, as the following chart from the Congressional Research Service shows.
""It's pretty straightforward,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. ""It's a record high, but it's quite low.""
If anything, Kaine underplayed the United States’ deficit compared to the rest of the world. The U.S. rank has bounced around a bit over the past year, but it places 96th in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings, among 191 countries for which there is data. That’s even worse than the 75th-place finish Kaine cited.
By comparison, the other countries Kaine mentioned did better, though hardly close to male-female parity. Iraq had 27 percent female legislators (58th in the most recent rankings), Afghanistan had 29 percent (ranking 50th) and Rwanda was indeed No. 1 in the world with 64 percent.",1,Tim Kaine
"""Democrat Maxine Waters has shown up to only 10 percent of congressional meetings for 35 years."" A blog post that accused U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D.-Calif., of being an absentee congresswoman for decades relied on a fake statistic from a thread on Reddit.
""Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS,"" read the headline on a June 7, 2017, post on TeddyStick.com . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The website, which doesn’t list contact information and has hidden its registration data , attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job.
The writer, who is credited on the post as Sam Di Gangi, wrote:
""Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that 'Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.' ""
The source is simply a Reddit thread from June 7, 2017 , which contains no evidence at all. It’s just a series of comments posted on Reddit’s ""the_donald"" forum. We contacted a Waters spokesman, who chose not to comment.
Waters is a long-serving legislator, but she hasn’t been in Congress for 35 years. She first started representing a California district in 1991, so she’s been in Washington for 26 years. She became a state legislator in 1977 and served until joining the U.S. House of Representatives, which amounts to 40 years of lawmaking experience.
Beyond that, it’s wrong to say Waters missed 90 percent of her ""congressional meetings,"" even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn’t specified.
It’s possible the post referred to her voting record, but that would be way off. As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That’s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate.
The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn’t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the Washington Examiner did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014.
Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats. U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., came in first, missing 96 percent of hearings in the Examiner’s analysis.
We spot-checked Waters’ 2015-16 record as ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, which also gives her ex officio status on a half-dozen subcommittees, meaning Waters could attend meetings for those subcommittees if she chose. By our count, Waters missed 37 percent of the hearings listed on the Government Publishing Office’s website.
There’s no evidence Waters attended a paltry 10 percent of meetings, however you count them. TeddyStick.com used a dubious source that appeared to have just made up the stat.",0,TeddyStick.com
"""Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals."" Ousted Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had already taken a drubbing over sexual harassment allegations, but fake news purveyors then started circulating a false story that he’d been beaten unconscious, too.
""Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals,"" read a headline on a May 4, 2017, story at DailyUSAUpdate.com. We found the story posted on other websites , as well.
The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ news feeds.
The post — which again, is fake — said O’Reilly was buying bagels in New York when three men and two women began complaining about his treatment of women.
O’Reilly was forced off Fox News Channel on April 19 and lost his show, The O’Reilly Factor, after multiple reports of sexual harassment . The New York Times had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims.
The confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O’Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until ""until he was unconscious and bleeding.""
The attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O’Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered ""a cardiac event,"" the story said.
Except none of the details about an attack are true. There is no apparent way to contact DailyUSAUpdate.com administrators, who have hidden the site’s registration information .
There were no reports from legitimate media sources that this event occurred, in any case. Surely such an attack would have been widely covered.
The hoax came about a week after other reports that Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident and Sarah Palin had been run off the road and was in a coma .
The fake O’Reilly story originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.

"""Rosa Parks’ daughter praises (President Donald) Trump’s response to Charlottesville."" A fake news story that said civil rights icon Rosa Parks’ daughter lauded President Donald Trump’s comments on clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was easily identifiable as fake news, because Parks didn’t have any children.
The headline on an Aug. 20, 2017, post on ForFreedomWorld.com read, ""Breaking: Rosa Parks’ daughter praises Trump’s response to Charlottesville."" The story was posted a week after Aug. 12 clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters over efforts to take down Confederate monuments.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to combat fake news.
The fake story is obviously designed to shock readers that the child of a civil rights hero like Parks could embrace controversial comments by Trump, who had called the violence in Charlottesville a result of ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""
The post quoted someone named Muriel Parks-Rosenberg speaking at an event at the Kennedy Center.
""President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,"" she is quoted as saying. ""He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.""
""My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,"" she allegedly told the crowd. ""Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back. To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon.""
Parks is credited as helping spark the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955.
Parks died in 2005 at age 92 . But she didn’t have a daughter who spoke in support of Trump, because Parks never had any children. The photo with the story is actually of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner .
The story was originally posted on Aug. 19 on OurLandOfTheFree.com , a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked , attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.
OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site’s creators ""make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not."" Its About Us page noted, ""All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not.""

"""Today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago."" The newly installed House speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., recently took to Medium to set the stage for a forum in Columbia, S.C., on Republican efforts to fight poverty. The forum, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, drew six 2016 Republican presidential candidates – former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired physician Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
In his Medium column, Ryan wrote that a new direction was needed on government anti-poverty efforts.
""We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now,"" he wrote. ""And I don’t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. I’m not saying we haven’t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty – that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves.""
Here, we’ll check Ryan’s statement that ""today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.""
When we asked Ryan’s staff for their evidence, they pointed us to an academic paper by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez and Nicholas Turner, "" Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility "" from January 2014. Chetty and Hendren are at Harvard, Kline and Saez are at the University of California-Berkeley, and Turner was with the U.S. Treasury Department.
The paper, based on extensive analysis of income and educational-attainment data, found that ""intergenerational mobility"" has ""remained extremely stable"" since the generation of Americans born in 1971.
""We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s,"" the authors wrote.
When we asked one of the co-authors, Saez, whether Ryan’s summary left out anything important, he said no.
""Yes, this is broadly correct,"" Saez told PolitiFact. Saez said the paper shows the odds of staying in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution when your parents were in the bottom one-fifth have stayed stable for the past four to five decades.
The paper and Saez in the interview both noted one caveat – that the consequences of the pattern Ryan is citing have worse effects today because inequality has grown over the same period.
""Because inequality has risen,"" the paper notes, ""the consequences of the ‘birth lottery’ – the parents to whom a child is born – are larger today than in the past.""
However, this caveat doesn’t undermine Ryan’s point. If anything, it accentuates it. (We're also not penalizing Ryan for rounding up the study's length to 50 years.)
Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, said the paper Ryan chose is a credible one within the profession. ""These are the authors I would turn to"" when looking at intergenerational mobility.",1,Paul Ryan
"Fleeing Syria, ""a million children are now refugees."" Most of the debate over a military strike on Syria involves broad strategic questions about stability in the region and defining clear goals for dropping bombs and launching missiles. But one strong supporter of the use of force brought in another factor -- refugees.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long argued for greater military engagement in Syria on moral grounds, among other reasons.
""It's shameful, while a million children are now refugees, "" McCain said on CBS’  Face the Nation .
We didn’t think McCain had the number of refugees wrong. We were simply struck that it was so high.
In the past 24 hours, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , UNHCR, announced that the number of refugees had crossed the 2 million mark. For a country with a population of 22.5 million, that means close to 10 percent of its people are in camps or with families outside its borders.
António Guterres, the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees, called it ""a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history.""
The UNHCR reports that more than half of the registered refugees are children. So McCain’s figure is accurate.
If anything, it undercounts the scope of the turmoil. Peter Garrett with the British Red Cross said this only tallies people who have registered with the UNHCR.
""We know there are people who will not have registered for support, for many reasons. They may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status,"" Garrett told CNN .
The surrounding countries are strained to deal with the outflow. Lebanon has taken in more refugees than any other country, about 720,000. Jordan is not far behind with over half a million, followed by Turkey.
In addition, the UNHCR reports said an estimated 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside their country. This would mean the conflict has forced nearly one out of every four persons from their homes.
With almost all refugees dependent on international organizations for food, blankets and medical people care, the UNHCR is calling for $2.9 billion in aid to meet their needs. Over 1 million new people left Syria in the first five months of 2013. The UNHCR said if current trends continue, the refugee count will top 3 million by the end of this year.",1,John McCain
"""Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!"" A fake news story saying former White House counsel Vince Foster’s body shows evidence that he didn’t die of a suicide is only part of a wide range of false Internet posts that won’t let rest the idea he was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
A March 24, 2017, story posted on Liberty-Courier.com carried the headline, ""Breaking: Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!"" The site, which is registered to an address in Utah , uses a name that evokes a newspaper, but is filled with fake news stories and has no immediately apparent contact information.
The Foster story was flagged by Facebook users, who reported it as potentially being fake as part of the website’s efforts to push fabricated stories out of its news feeds.
Foster, who was deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton and a former Arkansas law colleague of Hillary Clinton, committed suicide in 1993 at age 48, after suffering from depression. He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark.
Conspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide , despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The post, meanwhile, is fake, and has ended up on other fake news websites.
It says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster’s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide.
Foster’s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk — although there is a Naval Medical Center across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth.
The post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but actually is a handout photo from the Sacramento County (Calif.) Coroner’s Office.
The story first appeared on March 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked . Their posts often end up being repurposed by many other websites that don’t credit its origin, as is the case here.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this story or any other post is fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
TheLastLineOfDefense.org has developed a regular cottage industry of writing about Foster’s death. The site has previously written posts that said Gowdy had Foster’s body exhumed , then that it went missing from the morgue in Norfolk, or that WikiLeaks has proof of a conspiracy surrounding Foster’s death.
The assertion that Foster’s body has been dug up, autopsied again and his death ruled a homicide is completely made up.",0,Bloggers
"""Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book"" Social media users continue to be fooled by a fake news story touting a book allegedly written by a Secret Service agent claiming President Barack Obama is both Muslim and gay, but the entire claim should be cataloged under fiction.
""Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book,"" the headline on a story from the site NewsExaminer.net reads . The post is dated only ""six months ago,"" but there’s evidence the fake story goes back to 2015.
Social media users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the Facebook’s efforts to battle fake news. This one certainly qualifies.
The story says a former agent named Paul Horner had written the book, titled The Black House: A 12-year former Secret Service agent explains why Obama and the First Lady are ruining this country.
The book was ""quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts,"" according to the post. The article says that Horner confirmed the lascivious details of the book to an NBC senior political analyst named Tom Downey.
Everything about the story — the book, the author, the interview and certainly the details contained therein — is fake.
NewsExaminer.net describes itself as ""the place to find what's shaping your world. We curate the most important and engaging news so you don't have to."" The site is filled with fake news articles, but there’s no apparent disclaimer that the writing is supposed to be satirical.
The same story circulated on fake news site NBC.com.co on Oct. 2, 2015, and was resurrected at ABCNews.com.co on Nov. 16, 2016. Neither site is affiliated with the networks they attempt to represent. The stories cite the Associated Press as the source of a photo of the book used in the posts.
Paul Horner is an oft-used name in satirical and joke articles , but is also the name of ""a serial hoaxer and lead writer for National Report,"" a fake news site, as described by the Washington Post .
There is no NBC analyst named Tom Downey, and there also is no such book on Amazon, although there are other books with similar titles .
The absurd nature of the allegations should be a tip-off that the story is fake, although many of the commenters do not seem to understand the content is fabricated.
In the make-believe interview, Horner tells Downey that Obama constantly berated Christians, forced the pretend agent to listen to Diana Ross and had staff harass a Facebook page about a masturbating dolphin.

"Says Marco Rubio ""knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion."" Sen. Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen. Marco Rubio’s attacks at the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina were ""flat-out false.""
One attack pinpointed Cruz’s record on military spending.
""The only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget for (Sen.) Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense,"" Rubio said.
Cruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim.
""The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion,"" Cruz said. ""What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true.""
Rubio has criticized Cruz’s record on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections.
But on his specific point about voting for Rubio’s amendment, Cruz is right. (We're not fact-checking whether Rubio ""knows full well"" about Cruz's vote.)
Trying to counteract defense spending cuts over the past few years, Rubio put forth an amendment to increase military spending in March 2015 . If passed, the amendment would have raised projected defense spending outlays through 2022 in Congress’ proposed budget.
Cruz voted for the amendment. The measure failed 32-68.
Cruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but it’s a little unclear exactly how much Rubio’s amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defense’s 2012 fiscal year request , which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. , who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion.
The very same day , the Senate voted on a Paul amendment that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio both voted against the amendment, and it failed 4-96.",1,Ted Cruz

Trump’s youngest son is indeed on vacation with his family at their Bedminster resort, but we found no proof of his purported illness.
The post claimed Trump had sent a Snapchat photo to his friends captioned, ""Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday.""
We traced the image attached to the article to an 841-day old photo on an Instagram search engine called Mulpix. It’s not Barron Trump’s hand.
""He also tweeted his friends, saying that he was currently ‘in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital,’ "" the post said.
But we didn’t find any tweets mentioning a wheelchair or a hospital in the various unofficial Barron Trump Twitter pages.
The post also cited a nonexistent Fox News report that he was receiving treatment at an unnamed hospital.
In reality, the post is stealing some real-life events from surrounding a British television show host.
The host of the show Grand Tour, Jeremy Clarkson, was admitted to a Spanish hospital for pneumonia on Aug. 6, the same day as this fake news story was posted.
A spokesperson for the show said in a statement that Clarkson ""was admitted to hospital on Friday morning during a family holiday in Spain.""
Clarkson posted a photo on Instagram of his arm which he captioned, ""Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday.""
He also said he was in ""in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital"" in a tweet.

"""Donald Trump dead from a fatal heart attack!"" A fake news website is posting a real image of President-elect Donald Trump and using it to draw a bogus conclusion.
""Donald Trump dead from a fatal heart attack!"" screamed a Dec. 19, 2016, headline from a site called TheNewYorkEvening.com. The post came with a startling and real image of Trump sprawled out on the ground. The post and photo were flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news.
Obviously Trump is not dead. Reading a newspaper, turning on a TV or radio or going anywhere else on the Internet will prove that.
Bu where is that photo coming from? And is it real?
It is. It comes from Trump's 2007 appearance at WrestleMania 23.
Trump, who knows World Wrestling Entertainment kingpin Vince McMahon, had agreed to the Battle of the Billionaires . In that storyline, Trump and McMahon both chose a proxy wrestler to compete in the annual pay-per-view event, with the loser having his head shaved in front of the roaring crowd.
This screen grab of an image on fake news sites implied that it was taken after Donald Trump's imaginary heart attack, but it's actually Trump suffering from a Stone Cold Stunner during Wrestlemania 23.
At the match, Trump clotheslined McMahon prior to Trump’s wrestler winning the match. Trump then shaved McMahon’s head in the ring.
Notably absent from many online clips is what happened next : Guest referee Steve Austin delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to Trump, leaving Trump writhing on the mat. That’s the image being used in the fake news still.
Trump was involved with the WWE for several years after the match. One storyline in 2009 involved Trump buying the WWE’s Raw from McMahon, then selling it back to him for twice the price. Even though the sale was fake, it still caused WWE stock to drop 7 percent at one point.
Trump was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. Three years later, the president-elect tapped McMahon’s wife Linda McMahon, who donated $6 million to a Trump super PAC, to head the Small Business Administration .

G20 finance representatives have been meeting regularly since 1999. Heads of state and government for the 19 countries and top representatives for the European Union began meeting annually since 2008 in response to the financial crisis.
Obama attended the summits when he was president , but his spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that he was absent from this year’s event, ""nor was he in Germany.""
Obama was not even traveling abroad during that time, said Kevin Lewis, Obama’s spokesman. ""The last time that he was in Germany was about a month ago,"" Lewis said July 11.
The G20’s website lists Trump’s name and photo as the U.S. leader, not Obama. Trump is included in official photos of the event, not Obama. And had Obama actually appeared at the event, it would have made international news and being widely reported.

"""George H.W. Bush has died at 94."" No, former President George H. W. Bush is not dead.
On July 1, the hoax news site New York Timely Reports posted that he had.
""Former President George H. W. Bush has died at the age of 94, a spokesman said in a statement Sunday afternoon,"" the article said . ""According to Bush’s spokesman McGrath, the former president died ‘peacefully in his afternoon nap.’""
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
How do we know this claim is false?
Well, the last time a former president died was Dec. 26, 2006. That was the day Gerald Ford passed to his reward. Within 24 hours, there were 221 news articles.
For George H. W. Bush on July 1, 2018? Zero.
The president’s spokesman Jim McGrath posted nothing on his Twitter account . If he was releasing a statement to the press as the article said, then for sure he would have done the same on Twitter. His most recent tweet was from June 26 with a letter from Bush supporting Houston’s bid to host the 2020 Democratic convention. The day before, he retweeted a story about Bush getting a new dog named Sully. Former president Bill Clinton was there to welcome the dog, as well.
Bush has his own Twitter account. He congratulated the Republican gubernatorial primary winner in Colorado on June 27 .
He also tweeted about the dog.
For the record, the surviving former presidents include Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

"Says President Barack Obama ""tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers."" Former President Barack Obama somehow fleeced American taxpayers for millions of dollars and hid the money in offshore bank accounts using an alias, a fake news story claimed.
""Obama tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers,"" read the headline on an April 4, 2017, post on FederalistTribune.com. Facebook users flagged the story for possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
Out of the gate, we’ll note the story is fake.
It said that the United States Treasury paid $411 million for ""Royalty Payments for Obamacare"" to a limited liability corporation owned by someone named Barry Soetero.
The money was for the author of Obamacare for ""expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill."" The story said Obama was the bill’s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama's stepfather, Lolo Soetoro.)
FederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland.
Among other claims in the disjointed post is a citation for an April 4 missive on FreedomsFinalStand.com, which said Obama had denied using the Soetoro alias many times. FreedomsFinalStand.com said that these contrived royalty payments were stopped after Obamacare was renamed the Affordable Care Act.
That’s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama.
But let’s go back even farther: It appears this post first breached the Internet as a March 11 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site we know was designed to troll conservatives with faux news made up to stoke ire on political issues. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
The site’s articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, usually without an indication that they are fake.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, either. But its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
It’s difficult to say whether the other sites are in on the joke or not. FederalistTribune.com’s Contact Us link doesn’t seem to perform any action, and FreedomsFinalStand.com doesn’t appear to have contact information at all. Both sites are privately registered , with no personal contact information.
At any rate, the tale of Obama using an alias to bilk millions from the U.S. Treasury for naming his signature health care law was made up.",0,Bloggers
"""Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin."" A racially charged fake news story about a black man killing white women and putting their corpses on ice has been spread around the Internet for the past year.
It’s bogus.
""Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin,"" read the headline on a July 20, 2016, post on ViralDevil.com. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being false, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds.
The story said 39-year-old Rasheed Thompson was arrested in Chicago after neighbors reported suspicious activity. Police supposedly found the bodies while searching Thompson’s home.
The post is made up, and it has changed a bit since first appearing early in 2016.
The earliest version we found was posted on the fake news site Now8News.com, going back to at least Feb. 18, 2016. It was set in Los Angeles, and involved a man identified only as ""Mathis,"" who hid 12 white women’s bodies in a freezer marked ""Black Lives Matter.""
That was followed up the same month by EmpireHerald.com, which wrote the version about Chicago’s Thompson killing 19 women. The original link is gone , but the Internet Archive Wayback Machine has a record of the story .
EmpireHerald.com, a site filled with fake stories, carries no disclaimers about how its content is fabricated. It first started promoting the story the same day as the News8Now.com post.
This version of the story ended up on several other websites throughout the year . None of the websites identified the story as fake.
Some of the photographs often used to illustrate the story are of freezers really used to hide bodies, but aren’t of the fictional Thompson or his victims.
One image showed a chest freezer used by a Japanese man who strangled his wife and hid the body for a decade . Another showed police removing a freezer in which a California man’s body had been hidden after he was killed .

"""Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly … $800 billion last year alone."" Yanking back international trade is a cornerstone of Donald Trump’s bid for the presidency. He believes other countries benefit from our trade practices, while the United States suffers.
The trade deficit is how much more goods and services the United States imports than it exports, Trump says it’s too high.
""Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly — think of this, think of this — our trade deficit is $800 billion last year alone,"" Trump said in July 21 remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""We’re gonna fix that.""
Trump’s phrasing is a little off, but he’s got the idea right.
The country’s overall trade deficit in 2015 was about $500 billion, according to Census data , but that figure includes both goods and services.
Trump mentioned the trade deficit in goods, which includes all manufactured products, oil and agriculture products. The trade deficit in 2015 for just goods was $763 billion. Not quite $800 billion, but reasonably close.
The reason the overall trade deficit is smaller than just the goods trade deficit is because the United States exports more services than it imports.
This isn’t the highest the goods trade deficit has ever been. It ranged from $782 billion in 2005 to $832 billion in 2008.
It’s possible, however, that current figures actually understate the size of the goods trade deficit because oil prices have been abnormally low, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank supported in part by unions.
""It’s a large deficit,"" Scott said. ""And it needs to be reduced.""",1,Donald Trump
"Says the University of Florida ""requests to cancel rivalry game"" against Florida State University. The University of Florida football team is having a very bad, no fun football season. That’s true.

""UF requests to cancel rivalry game against FSU,"" read the headline on a post we first saw Nov. 7, 2017, on React365.com . Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news.

The fake story said: ""When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, ‘Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body.’ ""
The University of Florida Athletic Association didn’t make any such statement, and the Gators aren’t giving up on their Nov. 25 game at the Swamp. The story is completely made up.

"""UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256"" It’s not true that Democrat Doug Jones got more than 5,000 votes in a town of less than 3,000 people in the Alabama Senate race.
Unofficial results from the Dec. 12 special election show that overall, Jones beat his Republican contender Roy Moore by 1.5 percentage points, or about 20,000 more votes.
Moore’s election loss in deep-red Alabama prompted false stories of voter fraud , including a post from a website called Ladies of Liberty, headlined ""UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256.""
Ladies of Liberty describes itself as ""a whimsical playland of conservative satire."" It’s About page says that everything on the website is fiction.
""It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined,"" said the website’s About page.
Yet, we’ve seen website’s claim, though not always attributed to Ladies of Liberty, spread around on Facebook , with some users thinking it’s true.
Here’s what the post claims:
""The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that ‘more than a third’ of Jones’ votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious — and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham.
According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn’t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama.""
The quick facts:
The name of the purported board is a variation of the ""State Election Integrity Board"" named in other fake news items , which a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State previously told PolitiFact does no exist.
Bordalama? Doesn’t exist either. No mention of it in the U.S. Census’ list of places in Alabama.
As of 2 p.m. Dec. 15, Moore had not conceded the race, arguing that military and provisional ballots had not been counted yet and that the Alabama secretary of state still hadn’t certified the race. ( In a CNN interview , the Alabama secretary of state expressed skepticism that election outcome would be different.)

"""Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever."" A fake news story spread by a liberal troll website said the U.S. Supreme Court issued a bench warrant for the arrest in a fictional case against the Treasury Department.
""Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever,"" read the headline on a Nov. 6, 2017, post on FreeInfoMedia.com . We saw the same article on the same day posted to FreedomJunkshun.com , the fake news site where it originated.
Facebook users reported both posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. We also saw the same story on other sites .
The fake story said that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas had issued the warrant to compel a man named Donald M. Allard to testify ""on a case involving the Treasury Department’s mishandling of funds during the Obama administration.""
A bench warrant is a written order by a judge authorizing the police to find someone and bring them to court. The story said Allard, described as ""a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama,"" had previously been found in contempt in two fictional courts.
The Supreme Court wanted him to answer whether he was ""ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress,"" the story said.
There is no warrant, of course, just as there is no such case before the Supreme Court. The story is completely bogus.
FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.
The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair - affiliated sites and carries a disclaimer that reads , ""All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.""
Just to be sure the assertions in the story were fake, we asked a couple of legal experts whether there was any sort of case like the one described, or if the court had issued any bench warrants.
Tom Goldstein, who runs SCOTUSblog.com with his wife Amy Howe, told us that ""every possible aspect of that is fiction.""
Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was unaware of any bench warrant ever being issued by the Supreme Court.
""Bench warrants are issued to cause the arrest of someone who violated a court rule or showed contempt for the court, so in theory the Supreme Court could indeed issue one. But I’ve never heard of it,"" Shapiro said. ""Even in the handful of recent protest cases, the Supreme Court marshals or Capitol Police simply arrest the people on their pre-existent authority to do so.""
As a final note, we have to point out the tomfoolery surrounding the name of the supposed witness, Donald M. Allard. The letters of the name elide into Donald Mallard, which appears to be an allusion to Donald Duck.

"Says Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, ripped up a copy of the U.S. Constitution Images on the Internet of Parkland school shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez ripping up the U.S. Constitution gained lots of traction on social media, but the pictures were manipulated.
Gonzalez 18, has been the target of many conspiracy theories since the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.
The latest example came as hundreds of thousands of people rallied at March for Our Lives events March 24 in Washington and other cities around the country. Facebook groups such as Gun Owners of Merica and Twitter accounts circulated images and GIFs of Gonzalez tearing down the middle of the U.S. Constitution.
Twitter users, including Don Moynihan, a professor of government at University of Wisconsin-Madison, quickly pointed out that the images and GIFs were doctored.
The original image was taken from a video by  Teen Vogue  that appeared alongside an op-ed written by Gonzalez entitled ""Why This Generation Needs Gun Control.""
In the real video, Gonzalez is ripping up a gun-range target poster.
One of the accounts sharing the fake images — "" Linda the NRA Supporter "" — was suspended sometime after the posts.
But multiple other Twitter accounts (including Adam Baldwin from the tweet above) have shared the posts in the name of political satire.

"NASA Has Just Confirmed Earth Has A New Moon There’s more than one moon orbiting Earth?
That’s what smartmindmag.com claimed on an undated post headlined ""NASA Has Just Confirmed Earth Has A New Moon.""
""According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along,"" the website claimed . ""The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.""
Not quite.
The post heavily borrows from a June 2016 NASA report but takes liberties to stretch the truth.
NASA in 2016 announced the discovery of a small asteroid which as it orbits the sun, ""appears to circle around Earth as well."" But NASA did not say that the asteroid, labeled 2016 HO3, was a new moon orbiting Earth.
""It is too distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet, but it is the best and most stable example to date of a near-Earth companion, or ‘quasi-satellite’,"" the NASA report said.
A satellite is an object that moves around a larger object, and both the Earth and the moon are considered ""natural"" satellites, NASA explains . 2016 HO3’s characteristics only elevate it to ""quasi-satellite.""
The smartmindmag.com post included legitimate quotes that appear on NASA’s 2016 post, but jumped to a conclusion that NASA did not establish.
Both the NASA report and smartmindmag.com quote Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., as saying: ""Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth.""
Other more prominent news outlets ran similar headlines in 2016 about Earth having two moons, based on NASA’s report. Business Insider: SURPRISE: Earth has two moons .
But other websites covered the story more accurately. Slate’s headline hinted that details matter: Another Moon for Earth? Well, Not Really, but It Depends on Your Point of View. Gizmodo also explained the nuances in a story headlined: Earth's New 'Quasi' Moon Will Stick Around for Centuries .

"""Our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession."" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has been highly critical of the Obama administration for spending too much on the economic stimulus. Recently, Sanford cited a statistic compiled by the Bloomberg news service that ""our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession.""
It's a figure Sanford used in a commentary for   Human Events  , a conservative publication, and again in a letter to the editor of the   State Journal-Register  in Springfield, Ill.
It is taken from a March 31, 2009, Bloomberg story that begins, ""The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent, lent or committed $12.8 trillion, an amount that approaches the value of everything produced in the country last year, to stem the longest recession since the 1930s.""
At the bottom of the story is a chart breaking down how the number was derived. The lion's share — $7.7 trillion — comes from money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve for such things as credit discounts, debt purchases and bailouts of several financial institutions. Another $2 trillion relates to the FDIC, including liquidity guarantees and the purchase of risky bank assets.
And lastly is the money the federal government is spending through the two stimulus packages (the $168 billion stimulus under President George W. Bush and the $787 billion stimulus under President Barack Obama), as well as the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, used to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis.
Economists caution that the government is not necessarily ""out"" all of that money.
In the case of TARP money, for example, ""the estimates are that we will get most of the money back,"" said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities. And in the case of collateral extended to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, ""that's basically pledging to back up the operations of those organizations. We're pledging this money as collateral for that organization.""
It doesn't mean the money will ever be spent. And in the case of things like auto company bailouts, for example, the federal government got company stock and it's too early to know how much the government will get back on that. But presumably some. ""At the end of the day, a large portion of that won't end up getting spent,"" Horney said.
We had initially set out to fact-check Sanford for comment he made in a May 13, 2009, Fox Business Network interview when he said, ""This stimulus package, this federal effort ... at some point you know we spent about 20 percent of world GDP on this thing. You look at about $13 trillion last year and it's almost like you know Soviet-era grain quotas are saying you will produce this amount of grain in Kazakhstan, never mind the realities of what is going on, on the ground.""
He's right that $13 trillion represents about 20 percent of the world GDP, but he left out the all-important qualifiers for the $13 trillion number, that it is money ""spent, lent or committed,"" instead characterizing all of it as money the federal government ""spent.""
Economists hopped all over him for that one.
""If you are talking about an FDIC line of credit, there's a huge difference between that and spending X amount of dollars,"" Horney said. ""Calling it spending is just wrong.""
The comment even drew rebuke from the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
""Saying $13 trillion has been spent is definitely misleading,"" said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. ""It's not fair to combine all that with the word 'spent.'""
The actual amount spent by the federal government to slow the recession is closer to $2 trillion, he said.
Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer acknowledged that Sanford left out the ""spent, lent or committed"" qualifiers in the Fox interview. In TV interviews, he said via e-mail, ""questions come fast and furious and it's easy to leave out some words."" But, he said, it'd be unfair to judge Sanford on that lone response when he had twice cited the statistic correctly, in writing. We agree, although we'll be watching carefully to make sure Sanford includes the proper caveats.
Economists may disagree with this $13 trillion figure. There are many ways to calculate the amount the United States has pledged to stem the recession. But we think the Bloomberg calculation is one legitimate way. And we think it was certainly fair for Sanford to cite it, so long as he includes those all-important qualifiers. And on two occasions at least, he did.",1,Mark Sanford
"""Breaking: Shep Smith to be canned because he can’t control his hate for Donald Trump."" A hoax continues to circulate on Facebook that Fox News anchor Shepard Smith will be fired because he has been critical of President Donald Trump.
""Breaking: Shep Smith to be canned because he can’t control his hate for Donald Trump,"" said a headline by Newsflash . The website, which lacks original reporting, has a hodgepodge of articles about politics and celebrities.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
Fake stories stating that Smith will be or has been fired have circulated since 2017 on multiple websites. Snopes , which debunked the claim in 2017, found it first published on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that calls itself satire. We rated that version of the claim Pants on Fire almost a year ago.
The latest iteration of the story has been debunked by the Associated Press and Factcheck.org . We did our own reporting and came to the same conclusion that Smith’s job remains safe.
One easy giveaway: Smith was just rehired.
Smith, one of Fox’s original hires in 1996, is now the anchor of Shepard Smith Reporting (weekdays 3-4PM/ET). In March 2018, Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch announced that Smith, the chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news, signed a multiyear agreement.
In February, network spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the AP that the story that Smith has been let go was ""completely false.""
Smith has drawn the ire of some Trump fans because he has criticized the president on air.
Newsflash included an accurate quote by Smith in which he said Trump made a false statement that the media frequently under-reports radical Islamic terror attacks.
""In short, the president’s assertion is false,"" Smith said in February 2017. ""The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth.""
Smith told  Time  in an article published in March that he’s not bothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox’s opinion slate: ""We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want, if it’s their opinion. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I’m busy.""

"If the government shuts down, ""all military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available."" U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and other House Republicans oppose Obamacare and recently approved a measure to fund the government only if President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act,  is defunded.
But while addressing the House on Friday, the longest-serving Republican in Congress called the House plan a ""painful and inefficient way to govern,"" and cautioned his peers against a government shutdown.
Young included impact on the military in his list of examples of what would happen should the shutdown come to pass.
""All military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available,"" he said.
We wanted to see how soldiers’ wallets would be impacted if the government shuts down.
First, let’s review shutdown logistics. If the president and Congress can’t agree on funding for the new fiscal year, federal agencies can’t operate, except in emergencies.
The last shutdowns were in 1995 and 1996. In November 1995, the shutdown lasted five days, which was not long enough to affect military pay. From mid December 1995 to early January 1996, a 21-day shutdown occurred, which would have affected paychecks, if not for defense appropriations enacted on Dec. 1 that made funding available.
This time around, however, no such budget appropriations have been passed, or at least not yet. Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, said there is still enough time for the government to pass them.
Back in January, Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., introduced legislation that would allow both troops and civilians to get paid in the event of a shutdown, but the bill never made it out of committee.
Urban said the Defense Department was making plans based on its past experience with government shutdowns. In April 2011, before Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown, the department announced that the military would continue to work but would be paid retroactively. That would likely be the same plan this time around.
If the government shutdown does occur on Sept. 30, military members would receive their Oct. 1 paychecks on time, but Oct. 15 paychecks would be delayed.
We should note that civilians who work for the Defense Department wouldn’t fare as well, based on the 2011 report. Many would go on unpaid furlough during a shutdown.
""It would put a good bit of stress on an already stressed workforce,"" Urban said.",1,C.W. Bill Young
"""Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way."" In a TV ad, Barack Obama is praised by Kirk Dillard, a Republican state senator in Illinois. ""Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way,"" Dillard says.
We find the claim to be true. Yes, Obama worked with Republican members on some of the thorniest facing the Illinois General Assemby--even when it meant making his Democratic colleagues mad.
The legislature had not overhauled state ethics and finance laws for 25 years. Obama worked with a bipartisan group of four legislators, including Dillard, convened by former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.
""Obama worked very well with the other members of the group,"" said Mike Lawrence, executive director of what is now known as the Paul Simon Public Policy Center. Lawrence said that Obama favored more sweeping reforms than Republicans and others did, but was willing to compromise. The work resulted in the Gift Ban Act of 1988.
Obama worked with other Republicans on such issues as health insurance for kids and the state's death penalty--not an issue normally associated with bipartisan work between a liberal Democrat and Republicans.
Viewers may have watched the ad and decided Dillard was supporting Obama for president. But Dillard made the ad, despite saying that as a loyal Republican, he has endorsed Sen. John McCain for his party's presidential nomination--a fact that he did not mention in the ad.",1,Barack Obama

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Conservative Patriot’s story recaps President Donald Trump’s displeasure with Sessions’s recusal from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians.
The story includes comments on Fox News’ Hannity from legal and political analyst Gregg Jarrett, who said Sessions ""betrayed the president"" because he didn’t tell him that he would recuse himself from the investigation.
In the same interview, Sara Carter, a Fox news contributor, said Sessions ""was being advised badly"" at the time, and Jarrett interjected to say, ""by Obama’s holdovers.""
In March 2017, Sessions said he consulted ""senior officials"" about his role in the investigation and that ""my staff recommend recusal."" In a press release , Sessions said he ""met with the relevant senior career Department officials"" and after meetings, decided to recuse himself from investigations related to the campaigns for presidency.
Still, that does not prove ""colluding with Obama.""
Here’s what Sessions then said in a press conference about the recusal:
""I have been here just three weeks today. A lot has been happening in this three-week period. I wish I'd had more of my staff on board, but we're still waiting for confirmation for them.
""Much has been done. Much needs to be done. But I did and have done as I promised. I have met with senior officials shortly after arriving here. We evaluated the rules of ethics and recusal. I have considered the issues at stake. …
""I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign.""

"""Congress shoveled $700 billion into the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $325 billion of which has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets."" The Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, was envisioned as a giant pot of money the federal government could use to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. The idea was to buy the bad assets so banks would be in better shape to do more lending.
That was the original vision of Henry Paulson, the Bush administration's treasury secretary and one of the architects of the plan. He won quick approval from Congress in early October 2008.
But Paulson changed his strategy. Instead of using the early TARP money to buy the toxic assets, he decided to use it to invest in banks. That, Paulson said, would get them to resume lending.
Since then, critics have questioned whether the TARP money has been wisely spent. They have criticized TARP investments in banks that did not appear to be in serious trouble, and said it was unwise to spend $25 billion on the auto industry.
In his column on March 24, 2009, conservative writer George Will took aim at a variety of recent acts by Congress and the Obama administration. He described members of Congress as ""braying yahoos"" and said the Obama administration had invited private sector investors to become business partners ""with the capricious and increasingly anticonstitutional government. This latest plan to unfreeze the financial system came almost half a year after Congress shoveled $700 billion into the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $325 billion of which has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets.""
We had a vague recollection that TARP spending had been broadened at some point, but we wondered if Will was correct that such a large amount had been spent without buying the assets that were the original focus of the program. (Indeed, the program was named after them, creating a metaphorical acronym that suggested it was a temporary protection from storms.)
A quick history:
In early October, with fears that the economy was on the brink of collapse, Congress approved the $700 billion Paulson wanted, and President George W. Bush signed the measure into law. As we noted above, the early vision was to buy toxic assets.
But just 10 days later, Paulson and the Bush administration changed the game plan. Instead of buying toxic assets, they said they would buy stock in American banks to put them on sound footing so they could resume lending.
""Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy,"" Paulson said on Oct. 14. ""We regret having to take these actions. Today's actions are not what we ever wanted to do – but today's actions are what we must do to restore confidence to our financial system.""
Criticism grew. Some said Paulson had gotten too much leeway to spend the money. Congress began harrumphing and holding hearings, and oversight groups known as SIGTARP (the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program) and COP (the Congressional Oversight Panel) began to scrutinize the spending.
(A quick aside: The financial crisis has spawned some of coolest acronyms this side of the Pentagon, making it possible for Treasury officials to utter sentences like, ""COP and SIGTARP have examined the TARP but haven't yet focused on the P-PIP."")
The $325 billion cited by Will comes from the March 11 testimony by Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant secretary for financial stability who directs the TARP, before the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Asked about the status of the program and how much more would be needed, Kashkari said, ""We've deployed about 325 billion cash dollars out the door.""
And at that point, none of the money had been spent on buying toxic assets, according to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional research group, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group tracking spending on TARP and other stimulus programs on its site Stimulus Watch.
We should note that since that testimony, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has unveiled his proposal for buying the toxic assets, which would be partly paid for by a portion of the TARP money.",1,George Will
"Says Denzel Washington supports Donald Trump and speaks out against Barack Obama. A fake news story claiming actor Denzel Washington supports President-elect Donald Trump is making its rounds on social media.

"""I never had a filibuster-proof Senate."" In an interview with former President Bill Clinton on ABC's This Week on April  18, 2010, host Jake Tapper marveled at the fact that Clinton's first Supreme  Court nominee Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- now one of the most liberal members of the  court -- was confirmed in the Senate 96 to 3. In fact, Tapper noted, Sen. Orrin  Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, credited Clinton with bringing him into the consultation process when Ginsburg was chosen.
""What advice would  you give President Obama?"" Tapper asked. ""Because Republicans are saying he's  not including them in this.""
Clinton began by explaining that he faced a  different political environment.
""Well, I think for one thing, I had to do a  little more of that (reaching out to Republicans) because I never had a  filibuster-proof Senate,"" Clinton said. ""And now there are 41 of them, although  I think that a lot of those who come from more progressive states, the two Maine  senators, the new senator from Massachusetts, a lot of them may think they  already gave it the store on the health care deal or whatever they're doing on  financial reform. I think it will be very difficult to just outright block a  Supreme Court nominee that's otherwise qualified.""
With the close votes on health  care reform, we have all become a little more familiar with how important  political ratios can be to the legislative process. And so we decided to do a  little research into Clinton's claim that he never had a filibuster-proof  Senate.
A filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block  a vote on issue. It takes a three-fifths majority (60 out of 100 senators) to  invoke cloture and overcome a filibuster. That's why Scott Brown's election to  the Senate in Massachusetts was such an important victory for Republicans. It  gave Republicans 41 votes, enough to at least threaten a filibuster.
When  Clinton came into office in 1993, Democrats held the majority in the Senate. But  the ratio was not filibuster-proof. Senate records show Republicans held 43 seats when Clinton came  into office, and they added another seat in June of that year with the election  of Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
That was the Senate breakdown when Clinton  nominated Ginsburg on June 14, 1993, when she was confirmed by a 96-3  vote. And it was the same ratio (56 Democrats to 44 Republicans) when Clinton  nominated Stephen Breyer the following year (he was confirmed  87-9).
That would be as close as Clinton would ever come to a  filibuster-proof Senate.
In fact, Republicans won a majority of seats in  the Senate in the 1994 elections and retained control of both houses throughout  the remainder of Clinton's presidency.
The party split resurfaced later in the interview when Tapper asked  Clinton a nearly identical question to one Tapper posed a week earlier to  Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who championed the health  care reform bill in 1993 and 1994. Both were asked if they felt that because  they had ""stormed the castle"" on health care back in 1993, they had paved the  way for for Obama to succeed.
Hillary Clinton said she did not feel that  way , only that she was delighted it passed and that it was ""a long time coming.""
Bill Clinton said he ""absolutely"" did feel that way.
Clinton said  his health plan ultimately failed because, ""We couldn't pass it without five or  six Republicans. I had an obstacle President Obama didn't have. They had an  absolute, clear filibuster number. That is, they had 45 Republican senators.  They could have lost four and still defeated me.""
We note that Democrats  at the time were also more fractured on which health care plan to support. But  Clinton is right that Republicans opposed his health care bill and clearly held  enough seats to attempt a filibuster in the Senate. It never got to  that.
Still, that is one issue where Clinton had difficulty because he lacked a filibuster-proof majority (whereas Obama did have that advantage, at least for his first year).",1,Bill Clinton
"Says Russian President Vladimir Putin said Pope Francis ""is not a man of God."" Internet posts claim Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Pope Francis ""is not a man of God,"" but we could find no proof of Putin saying such a thing.
An Aug. 5, 2017, post on USAConservativeReport.com said that Putin condemned Pope Francis in a speech at the Naval Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Kronstadt, near St. Petersburg.
""Pope Francis is using his platform to push a dangerous far-left political ideology on vulnerable people around the world, people who trust him because of his position,"" Putin is quoted. ""If you look at what he (the Pope) says it’s clear that he is not a man of God. At least not the Christian God. Not the God of the Bible.
""He dreams of a world government and a global communist system of repression,"" Putin added. ""As we have seen before in communist states, this system is not compatible with Christianity.""
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news.
There are no dates given for Putin’s supposed comments, nor is there any indication to whom he was speaking. The post includes a YouTube video apparently generated by a computer that repeats the information.
Comments found in the USAConservativeReport.com post appeared on other outlets, none of which provided an original source for the comments. USAConservativeReport.com has no contact information, and our attempts to reach other outlets that shared similar stories, MacedoniaOnline.eu and YourNewsWire.com , went unanswered.
After a thorough search online and through Nexis archives, we didn’t find any record of Putin saying the Pope was ""not a man of God.""
Putin did make an official visit to the Naval Cathedra l on July 30, which is Navy Day in Russia, an annual celebration of nautical military might. Putin also spoke to about 5,000 sailors . But he did not discuss the pope.
The speech was available on YouTube, with a translation that jibed with Western reports:
The Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church have a strained relationship, with Russian believers accusing the Vatican of deliberately working to convert worshippers. The Catholic Church has denied doing so.
Putin and Pope Francis have met on two occasions, when the Russian president visited Vatican City in 2013 and 2015 . While the pair discussed Christian persecution on both visits, topics also included Russian involvement in Syria and Ukraine.
Putin isn’t Catholic, but there’s no record we can find of him berating the pontiff in such a way.",0,Bloggers
"""For the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."" President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing.
""Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger,"" he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. ""Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.""
PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama’s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers.
A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama’s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995.
We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report , the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day.
So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point?
Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports.
""Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,""Medlock said.
The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply.
Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University.
Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing.
We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines.
But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades.
Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards.",1,Barack Obama
"""Obama released 10 Russian agents from U.S. custody in 2010 during Hillary’s uranium deal."" A headline points the finger at former President Barack Obama for releasing Russian agents.
""Obama released 10 Russian agents from U.S. custody in 2010 during Hillary’s uranium deal,"" stated the Nov. 26 headline in Puppet String News.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While Puppet String News is a fake news website , in this case the headline stems from real news.
The Puppet String story linked to an October 2010  New York Times  story which stated that Russian sleeper agents, arrested in the United States in the summer of 2010 and deported to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange , later received top government honors from President Dmitri Medvedev .
In exchange for the Russian prisoners, Medvedev signed pardons for four men Russia considered spies who had been held for many years.
""The agreement we reached today provides a successful resolution for the United States and its interests,"" Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at the time.
The Puppet String News story included information from the New York Times story recapping the prisoner swap, which involved the arrest of the agents in the suburbs of New York, Boston and Northern Virginia in the summer of 2010. The agents had been directed to gather information in the U.S. on nuclear weapons, American policy toward Iran and other topics.
The agents were ""widely lampooned in the West as bumbling caricatures of a bygone era"" for using outdated methods, but in Russia they were praised by top leaders, the New York Times wrote.
There was nothing in the New York Times story that mentioned Hillary Clinton or uranium.
The Puppet String News article then added it’s own speculation -- without any evidence -- that the swap involved Russia providing millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for Obama releasing the Russian agents.
""As this sounds like the case with these 10 Russian agents being deported back to Russia in 2010 at the same time of the Uranium One deal,"" Puppet String News wrote.
PolitiFact has previously explained the complex tale which pertains to a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, the Clinton Foundation, and a decision by several federal agencies to allow greater Russian influence in the United States’ uranium market.
Some have alleged that, as secretary of state, Clinton approved the sale of U.S. uranium assets to Russia’s nuclear energy agency in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal may appear fishy to some, there has been no proof of quid pro quo . And it’s not accurate to say that Clinton approved the sale herself.
Most of the Clinton Foundation donations in question occurred before and during Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, before she could have known she would become secretary of state.
The decision in 2010 to greenlight the Uranium One deal was approved by a panel comprising multiple governmental agencies, so it’s misleading to conclude the State Department, then headed by Clinton, acted unilaterally.
We sent a message to Puppet String News via Facebook and did not get a reply.
By all indications, the prisoner release is no more connected to the Uranium One deal than any number of other events that occurred in 2010.",0,PuppetStringNews.com
"Says Donald Trump ""used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower."" Seeking to portray Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration, Hillary Clinton claimed during the third presidential debate that the billionaire candidate used undocumented workers to build his New York City skyscraper.
In a jab at Trump, Clinton said her immigration plan would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and protect them from employers like Trump taking advantage of them.
""And Donald knows a lot about this,"" she said. ""He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ‘You complain, I'll get you deported.’ ""
This line of attack is similar to one used by one of Trump’s primary rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who in February accused him of hiring ""illegal"" Polish workers on a construction project decades ago. We rated Rubio’s claim Half True because he attributed more blame to Trump and mentioned a separate issue of a legal settlement. There’s also more evidence now to support Clinton’s simpler statement.
Between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish a Manhattan building to make way for the eventual Trump Tower. That contractor in turn hired local union workers as well as 200 undocumented Polish workers to meet the tight deadlines.
Media reports indicated that the Polish employees were paid off the books, working 12-hour shifts every day for only $4 to $5 an hour without overtime pay.
Time magazine reported that Trump allegedly sought out the workers after seeing them on another construction job, and then threatened through his lawyer to contact immigration services during a dispute over unpaid wages.
In 1983, union members hired to work on the project sued Trump, a union boss and the contractor for using the undocumented Polish workers to undercut their pensions and welfare funds. The future Republican presidential candidate appeared in court in 1990 and denied knowing that the workers weren’t in the country legally, but a Manhattan judge ended up ruling against Trump and ordered him to pay the workers more than $325,000.
Trump appealed the case, which dragged on for another decade, before quietly settling out of court in 1999.
The Republican candidate’s alleged use of undocumented workers has continued even into the current presidential campaign.
Several construction workers interviewed by the Washington Post in July 2015 said they were hired to help renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington despite residing in the country illegally. A Trump spokeswoman at the time said his business and contractors followed all applicable immigration laws.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Russian mansions Obama seized were meant to be illegal gifts to Sasha and Malia"" Two Russian diplomats’ mansions in New York and Maryland that were seized in December as punishment for Russia’s meddling in the election made headlines again last week when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov demanded the properties be returned.
""We think that the diplomatic property must be returned without any conditions and talks,"" Peskov told CNN Monday.
The properties have sat empty since the sanctions were imposed, but a fake news story has come up with a creative repurposing for them.
A post that appeared on Newsfeedhunter.com on July 12, 2017, said that Obama seized the mansions as gifts for his daughters, Sasha and Malia.
""It looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards,"" the post said.
The intelligence community has already confirmed that Russia meddled in the election, but even so, there’s no way Obama could have gifted the mansions to his family.
The Russian properties will be held by U.S. government until the issue with Russia is resolved, according to Harley Balzer, a government and international affairs professor at Georgetown University.
It would then take years to transfer ownership to anyone.
""Almost 40 years after the United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran (which we have certainly not done with Russia) the Iranian embassy on Massachusetts Avenue has still not been turned over to the Obama girls for parties,"" said Steve Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Captions on photos of the two houses say the girls won’t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn’t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov’s demand.
""Those properties to which you refer are part of a larger dialogue with the Russian Federation,"" Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
""There are a whole host of issues we're discussing with the Russian Federation, but my commitment is that we will consult with you on this issue before any final implementation of an agreement that we don't have yet with the Russian Federation,"" Sullivan said.

""Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week found dead with ‘gunshot to the head,’ "" stated a Jan. 14 headline on US Political News .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the story offers no evidence to tie the former Haitian official, Klaus Eberwein, to criticisms of the Clinton Foundation and largely repeats information from a fake news story last year .
In July, the  Miami Herald reported that Eberwein , a former Haitian government official, was found dead in a South Florida motel room. Eberwein, who had worked as an Uber driver in South Florida, had fallen on hard times.
Eberwein served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social (FAES), from May 2012 until February 2015 when he was replaced. The Herald reported that Eberwein had faced allegations of fraud and corruption on how FAES administered funds.
Eberwein shot himself in the head the day he was supposed to appear before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds, the money Haiti receives from Venezuela’s discounted oil program.
The Herald story made no mention of the Clinton Foundation or the Clintons. But a couple of days later, YourNewsWire, a website that posts fake news, made a series of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements tying Eberwein to criticism of the Clinton Foundation.
Your News Wire wrote that Eberwein was ""widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.""
""The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,"" YourNewsWire quoted Eberwein as saying at a Clinton Foundation protest.
But the website offered no evidence that Eberwein planned to testify against the Clinton Foundation or made any such statements.
US Political News used many portions of the YourNewsWire article and then added some additional information, including a clip of actual statements by another former Haitian official about the Clintons.
US Political News included a video of the former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, at a 2016 Donald Trump campaign event in Little Haiti in South Florida. Sansaricq criticized the record of the Clintons in Haiti.
The Clintons have a long and complicated history with Haiti, but there is no evidence that Eberwein was ""getting ready to ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption."" He was getting ready to testify about something unrelated: money Haiti received from a Venezuela oil program.
Finally, the timeline of the fake story makes no sense: Eberwein committed suicide in July 2017 while the January 2018 headline says he was getting ready to testify ""next week.""",0,US Political News

The link at HoustonChronicle-tv.com redirects to a story on NewsPhd.com , which in turn credits the story to ""Houston Chronicles TV."" The Internet Archive showed that the story originally was posted at HoustonChronicle-tv.com but has apparently since been changed.
The post said the champion boxer was giving $200 million to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, which displaced thousands with high winds and flooding. As of this writing, the death toll has reached 24 , according to CNN.
""My thoughts and prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Houston,"" Mayweather is quoted. ""My initiative is donating $200m to the entire Houston community to assist and house victims of the devastating flood that has rendered people homeless. The fund is intended to provide shelter, food, clothing and medicines.""
Facebook users also flagged the same assertion on a couple of other websites .
There is no credible report that Mayweather, pictured below, has made a contribution that large.
Mayweather’s name likely became a target for fake news writers after he won a guaranteed $100 million for his Aug. 26 boxing match against MMA fighter Conor McGregor (his share of money from the fight could climb as high as $300 million).
HoustonChronicle-tv.com is not the website for a TV news station, or the Houston area’s real newspaper, the Houston Chronicle . It’s a fake news site that we’ve listed on our Fake News Almanac as mimicking a legitimate media outlet.
While Mayweather does have a foundation that aids and promotes community groups , there has been no news that the foundation or the boxer have given money out specifically for hurricane relief.
Another sign the story is fake is that the same unsubstantiated details have been attributed to other boxers. This same story has already been reused, almost word-for-word, to say that boxer Manny Pacquiao gave $50 million to the city for hurricane relief.

She did this by citing her own residence for the past eight years as an example of how far her country had come.
""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves,"" she said. ""And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.

We have previously checked whether the building at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the U.S. Capitol, was built by slaves. We rated it True .
Here, we’ll take a look at whether the first lady was correct that the White House ""was built by slaves.""
The White House Historical Association -- a private preservation and educational group for the presidential residence complex -- has a web page devoted to the question, ""Did slaves build the White House?""
It reads in part: ""Construction on the president's house began in 1792 in Washington, D.C., a new capital situated in a sparsely settled region far from a major population center. The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states -- Virginia and Maryland -- ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings.
""The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American(s) — enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.""
A stonemason, Collen Williamson, ""trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Va.,"" the group wrote. ""Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the president's house. The slaves joined a workforce that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.""
These payroll records show that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them. Slave carpenters Ben, Daniel, and Peter were noted as being owned by James Hoban. (National Archives and Records Administration/White House Historical Association)
Journalist Jesse J. Holland also discussed the role of slaves in building the White House in his 2016 book, The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House.
""With the invention of steam shovels still several years away, these slaves dug for the clay on site with hand shovels, working day and night to get the raw material to the skilled brick makers and at the same time, opening up ground on the site for the space that would become the White House’s foundation and cellar,"" Holland wrote.

According to the inaccurate report, Trump’s attack on Waters was a ""barely veiled threat"" based on a misunderstanding of Waters’ comments about the public’s treatment of officials in the Trump administration. The tweet came in response to video footage that showed Waters, at a rally outside a federal office building in Los Angeles, encouraging Trump opponents to boo or harass Trump administrators in public spaces.
""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!,"" Trump wrote.
The false story said Trump’s tweet coincided with a California man’s guilty plea in relation to a murder threat delivered to Waters. The plea — entered by Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, of San Pedro, California — proved that ""the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences,"" the story said.
The story erred in getting details and timing of real incidents wrong.
A man by the name of Anthony Scott Lloyd did, in fact, plead guilty to threatening a United States official. Lloyd phoned Waters’ office on Oct. 22, 2017, and left a voicemail riddled with derogatory language, including racial epithets and expletives. The message used the words ""dead"" and ""kill"" a total of four times, according to a press release from the Department of Justice.
""If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you,"" Lloyd said, according to court documents. ""If you do it again, you’re dead."" (We obtained a digital copy of the plea agreement, which included a full transcript of the voicemail, from Thom Mrozek, spokesperson for the United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California.)
But Lloyd plead guilty on April 16, 2018, and Trump tweeted at Waters more than two months later on June 25, 2018. So it is not true that the two events occurred on the same day, as the false headline suggested.
The headline is likely not the result of confusion, either, because no reports related to Lloyd’s case were released on the day of Trump’s tweet. Lloyd’s sentencing date is set for July 16, 2018, and Mrozek said there have not been any new developments in the case since the guilty plea.
Plus, Lloyd only plead guilty to threatening Waters. He was not charged with ""trying to murder"" the congresswoman. Mrozek said prosecutors have not made any allegations related to an actual attempt at murder.

"""Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian"" Don’t listen to the fake news that a group of girls in Saudi Arabia will be killed for dancing at a birthday party.
""Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian,"" stated the headline on religionmind.com on Oct. 23.
That’s not true.
We found the story after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Religionmind.com is a fake news website about various religions.
We attempted to contact someone at the website but did not get a reply. The ""about"" section of the website states that it tries to keep the content correct, ""yet we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability ... .""
Here’s what the fake news story said: Fathima Al Kwaini was celebrating her birthday at a friend’s house. Tipped off by an assistant of an Imam, police arrived to find the girls dancing with their friends including males. Police arrested the girls.
The article then states that the girls were detained for more than a year and that a male-only Sharia panel concluded that they need to be ""executed in accordance with the Sharia law.""
A photo in the article does not back up the narrative. It appears to be the same as a photo by Reuters/Pajhwok News Agency on Aug. 31, 2015, showing an Afghan judge hitting a 22-year-old woman with a whip in front of a crowd in Ghor province, Afghanistan.
The article attributed some of the information to ""HRW"" without explaining what the acronym stands for. We thought it might have been a reference to Human Rights Watch, an organization that tracks human rights abuses across the globe.
A researcher at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle, told PolitiFact that the story is a fabrication.
""Gender mixing in Saudi Arabia can lead to criminal penalties but never the death penalty,"" he said.
So far in 2017 there have been 133 executions in Saudi Arabia, nearly all for murder or drug smuggling.
""In terms of executions of children, unfortunately Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries in the world that continues to sentence child offenders to death, and some have eventually been executed, but I’ve never seen an execution of anyone who is under 18 at the time of the execution,"" he said.
In the case of this headline, there is no evidence that these girls were beheaded for being with their male friends.",0,religionmind.com
"Says Keanu Reeves said, ""For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him."" An online hoax purports to quote actor Keanu Reeves expressing full-throated support for President Donald Trump.
The item appears on the website supporttrumppresidency.blogspot.com, and contains a banner headline that reads: ""For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him.""
But neither the text contained in the body of the article, nor a video embedded in the post, supports the emphatic headline.
The body of the article is entirely unrelated to politics. It tells an anecdote of Reeves' experience on set during the shooting of the 1994 action film Speed, co-starring Sandra Bullock.
The video at the end of the post shows an interview Reeves did with a journalist in Uruguay, in which he discussed his early career and current film projects.
Neither the text nor the video mentions politics, much less the actor's views on Trump.
In fact, the only instance we found of Reeves discussing Trump publicly is when he appeared to criticize the president’s travel ban during a January 2017 question-and-answer with journalists at a red carpet event.
Reeves told a journalist he believed the travel ban was ""just terrible,"" according to a Jan. 31, 2017, Associated Press article.
The only other references we found to Reeves' putative support for Trump were from other dubious websites that repeated the same baseless quote.
Reeves' publicist confirmed the quote is fake.
""It is completely false,"" said Cheryl Maisel, of talent agency PMK-BNC. ""He never made those comments nor did he ever do that interview. All manufactured.""
This is not the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We previously checked a lengthy cultural critique misattributed to Reeves, which we rated Pants on Fire .",0,Bloggers
"""Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders"" Snopes , a fact-checking website, rated the claim Mostly False after interviewing businesses near the restaurant. Snopes found that Sanders’ inlaws went to another nearby restaurant, the Southern Inn, and at some point in the evening members of the group encountered Wilkinson outside on the street, but it’s not clear whether Wilkinson followed them there or simply happened to be passing by.
PolitiFact contacted the Lexington, Va. police to ask if they had any reports of a threat against Sanders and did not get a reply.
The Red Hen’s request for President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant has fueled some exaggerations on social media.
""Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders after biz was destroyed by booting her,"" said a June 26 headline by The Houston Post, a pro-Trump website which has the same name as a now defunct newspaper .
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
Although the Red Hen owner’s decision to ask Sanders to leave led to a firestorm of both criticism and support, we found no evidence that she threatened Sanders. The Houston Post story doesn’t contain any information about a threat.
Here’s what happened at the Lexington, Va., restaurant: on June 22, Stephanie Wilkinson asked Sanders to leave her restaurant after staff members raised concerns.
Wilkinson told the Washington Post that Sanders works in an ""inhumane and unethical"" administration.
""I'm not a huge fan of confrontation,"" Wilkinson said. But ""this feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.""
Sanders left without incident and later tweeted : ""Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.""
While we found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened anyone,  The Roanoke Times  reported that a man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after he tossed a bucket of chicken manure on the sidewalk beside the restaurant and shouted, ""Make America great again,"" Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan.
We found no contact information on the Houston Post’s website. We sent an email to The Red Hen and did not get a reply.
The Houston Post wrote that ""Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders."" Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen, asked Sanders to leave her restaurant June 22. We found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened Sanders.",0,The Houston Post
"""Clint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign"" A bogus news item would have you believe that Clint Eastwood will soon be shuffling off this mortal coil.
""Clint Eastwood says his doctors have put him on notice to get his affairs in order and prepare for that final trip in one of those limousine station wagons we call a hearse,"" said the Maga2020.com website . ""The famous actor, 89, says he’ll be lucky to see 2019.""
Eastwood is actually 88, but the part that caught our eye had to do with Eastwood’s parting gift to boost the political fortunes of President Donald Trump:
""Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign.""
That would be generous, and illegal.
""That certainly would exceed the contribution limits to give something of such value to a campaign,"" said Brendan Glavin with the Campaign Finance Institute.
Robert Maguire with the Center for Responsive Politics echoed the point.
""I do not know of any rule that exempts either donors — in this life or the next — from the limits the FEC has placed on direct contributions to campaign committees,"" Maguire said.
This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
The campaign contribution rests on Eastwood’s imminent demise. That too is false.
Not only is there no mention of it in any remotely reliable news source (we checked on the Lexis-Nexis news database), but Eastwood just started a new film that he will both direct and act in called Mule.
Shooting begins in the second half of July in Las Cruces, N.M. If Eastwood’s health were precarious, a bolt of cash to the local economy would be at risk. The editors of the Las Cruces Sun News see no clouds on the horizon.
""We hope that as many local workers and businesses as possible apply for these jobs and services, allowing us to get the maximum economic impact from the production,"" they wrote July 13 .
There’s no evidence that Eastwood is ailing and he would be legally barred from donating millions to the Trump campaign.

"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States ""will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law."" A viral story said that the U.S. Supreme Court sided with President Donald Trump and ruled that public schools will not teach Sharia law.
""Breaking: Supreme Court sides with Trump - this changes everything!"" said a March 9 headline on Nowtrump.com , a pro-Trump fake news website.
The story said that the court ruled that public school in the United States ""will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.""
We found that this story recycles misinformation from 2017 about a court ruling that doesn’t exist. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The story said that on behalf of the U.S. Education Department, Trump’s legal team petitioned the court to make America safer. The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that public schools ""will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.""
However, Nowtrump.com (a play on the ""never Trump"" movement) wrote that according to USA Politics Today, students will learn about Islam, as they do about other religions, in history. ( Snopes fact-checked the USA Politics Today story in 2017, which is similar to the Nowtrump story.)
The Nowtrump.com story then made up inflammatory quotes by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.
""We certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day,"" Gorsuch said, according to the article.
We found no actual quote by Gorsuch, and the timing of the alleged court ruling makes no sense based on when Gorsuch joined the court.
FactCheck.org fact-checked a similar story on another website on April 11, 2017, and noted that Gorsuch didn’t hear his first case until April 17 -- about a week after the fake news story first appeared.
It is worth noting that public schools can teach about religion, according to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In Abington vs. Schempp, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court:
""It might well be said that one’s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.""
Nowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States ""will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.""
There has been no such ruling banning schools from teaching about Islam or Sharia law. The story includes made-up quotes by Gorsuch.",0,Nowtrump.com
"""Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election."" A fake news story on Facebook claims that while the liberal media ""ridiculed"" President Donald Trump over his claim that former President Barack Obama spied on him during the election, America has now learned that Obama did indeed spy and will be indicted.
""Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election,"" stated a Feb. 1 article by The Global Headlines , a fake news website that bashes Democrats.
The clickbait article declares at the conclusion: ""Share this story if you want to see Obama behind bars for the rest of his treasonous life!""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no evidence that Obama is poised to be indicted or that he wiretapped Trump.
A similar, shorter version of this story appeared on freedomnewscenter.com in September and follows a pattern of fake news stories over the past year that said that Obama wiretapped Trump’s phones during the election. Some photos included a doctored photo of Obama in handcuffs in court .
On March 4, 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama ordered surveillance on him during the election.
As we explained following his tweets , it’s possible the Trump White House is privy to investigative activities that aren’t in the public record. However, it appeared more likely that Trump took several media reports about legitimate intelligence investigations into his associates’ possible Russia ties and wove them into a new, unsubstantiated theory that Obama himself did something illegal.
The  New York Times and  Washington Post  reported — based on anonymous sources — that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trump’s tweets because they wrongly imply the FBI broke the law.
Additionally, an Obama spokesman has categorically denied that the Obama White House ordered any wiretapping.
The Global Headlines story focused on comments by former CIA analyst and retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, who was interviewed following Trump’s tweets. Shaffer, who is frequently interviewed on Fox News and works for the conservative London Center for Policy Research, told  Newsweek  in 2016 that the incoming Trump administration asked him to apply for a job.
The Global Headlines mentioned a ""recent"" interview by Shaffer on the radio show ""Trending Today USA,"" but that interview was actually 11 months ago.
The interviewer asked Shaffer if Obama should be arrested:
""This could be first time a former president could be indicted for a felony, because I think that it’s very possible that he acted outside the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation’s state on a candidate,"" he said in a clip of the interview. ""This is, as I said before, Soviet dictator-level wrongdoing.""
There is no evidence that Obama himself ordered wiretapping to spy on Trump during the election and is now headed toward an indictment. Trump tweeted in 2017 that Obama had ordered surveillance on him. While there have been media reports about intelligence investigations into Trump’s associates’ possible Russia ties, there is no proof that Obama himself ordered wiretapping of Trump.",0,Bloggers
"""Sarah Palin in a coma after hit and run."" A fake report spread on the eve of President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was in a coma after a car accident.
""Sarah Palin in a coma after hit and run,"" read the headline on an April 28, 2017, post . We first saw it on FreedomCrossroads.us, a website registered in Maine . But the post appeared on several other websites across the Internet without being attributed to an original source.
Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to clear out fake news from user news feeds.
The fake story said that Palin had been driving on the Pacific Coast Highway (with no state given) that morning when she was run off the road by another, unspecified vehicle. The post said her SUV rolled several times and stopped in a drainage ditch.
The image used to illustrate the rollover was actually of a fatal 2015 accident in Mississippi.
Palin was ""currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh,"" according to the post. Authorities were searching for the other vehicle, which was caught on camera, the article said. The FBI had reportedly been dispatched, too.
Palin had been tweeting right before noon and even later in the day , and posts kept appearing both on her Twitter and Facebook accounts through the weekend. We attempted to reach her office through her website, SarahPalin.com, and by email, but received no response.
There was no coverage by any legitimate media outlet of an accident involving Palin, which you’d figure would be spotlighted on cable news. The sensational nature of the story, misappropriated photo and lack of specifics made it obvious this was fake news.
But the Internet wasn’t done, because a follow-up post appeared on April 30 . That story again was shared on multiple websites , including FreedomCrossroads.us. It said Palin had woken up and was able to identify who ran her off the road.
That story said the California Highway Patrol traced a license plate back to a car rented with a fake ID, with video from a security camera at rental company in Silicon Valley. The post described a white man in his 30s.
Several websites used the same image, but it was actually of a robbery suspect at an Oklahoma hotel in 2012.
But since the first story didn’t happen, the second one didn’t, either. The only wide coverage Palin had received as of late was a well-publicized visit to the White House on April 19.

"""Well, you know, the Teamsters wanted to drill in Alaska. I voted against drilling in Alaska. So it's not like I'm a slam dunk on every issue."" During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Nov. 15, 2007, CNN host Wolf Blitzer tried to probe the limits of Rep. Dennis Kucinich's longstanding support of union positions. Blitzer said: ""I take it that ... there's nothing — there's no issues, no major issues you disagree with America's unions.""
Kucinich, a House member from Ohio, responded with this statement, which we find to be True.
In 2001, Teamsters officials lobbied Capitol Hill in favor of oil exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
""It's time for America to have what it has lacked for too long: a responsible, realistic energy plan that meets our needs and protects our future,"" Jerry Hood, a Teamsters leader from Alaska, said at a news conference on July 31, 2001.
One day later, Kucinich voted against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when he voted ""yes"" for an amendment that would have removed proexploration provisions from an energy bill. He cites threats to the environment and human rights in his opposition to exploration.
Kucinich calls himself ""the candidate of workers ... the one candidate in the race who comes right from the working class and can address those needs directly because I remember where I came from.""

"Says Donald Trump was ""caught investing in (the) Dakota Pipeline before signing it."" A left-leaning blog asserts that President Donald Trump was busted for approving the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for financial gain, but the facts of the case ended up being buried.
""Breaking: Trump caught investing in Dakota Pipeline before signing it,"" read the headline on an undated post on LearnProgress.org. The blog regularly posts items lambasting Trump and his policies.
Facebook flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of its efforts to weed out fake news in its users’ feeds. Most instances of the story being shared on Facebook are on Feb. 8, 2017 . The website did not answer our request to confirm the date.
But the implication that Trump approved the pipeline in order to profit from its construction doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.
In the post, LearnProgress.org cited a Nov. 26, 2016, Associated Press report that showed Trump owned shares in two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois.
Environmentalists and Native American tribes have opposed the route of the pipeline, and in December then-President Barack Obama blocked completion of the project .
The AP story pointed out that Trump owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock for a Texas company called Energy Transfer Partners. He had between $500,000 and $1 million the year before that. He also owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in energy company Phillips 66, which the AP says has a one-quarter share of the pipeline.
This was considered a potential conflict of interest for the future president, but to say he was ""caught"" is out of bounds. He listed the information on May 2016 federal disclosure forms .
Much has been made of Trump’s stock in the companies . The issue was reported on widely , as was the fact that he said he sold the shares of pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016 .
The White House has not confirmed whether he still owns the Phillips 66 shares, so that does remain a question mark. A Trump spokesman we contacted did not answer our questions about those shares.
In any event, the headline suggests that Trump dumped a bunch of money into the pipeline and then approved its construction, ostensibly to make a big profit from it. The timeline doesn’t support that.
Trump said in December 2016, before his inauguration, that he would restart pipeline construction . He didn’t have any actual power to do so until Jan. 20, 2017, well after he sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock.
He did sign an executive action on Jan. 24 to get the pipeline moving again . Construction resumed on Feb. 9 , and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe challenged the pipeline in court on Feb. 14 .
The headline’s assertion that Trump was caught in some kind of wrongdoing by investing in the pipeline before approving it is wrong and misleading. The potential conflict of interest was known and at least partially addressed before Trump became president and restarted the project.",0,LearnProgress.org

"Says there is a ""new law now charging all protesters with terrorism."" The headline on an Internet post claims a recently passed law allows protesters to face terrorism charges, but a closer read shows the post is guilty of misrepresenting the facts.
""New law now charging all protesters with terrorism,"" reads an undated post on a site called RedRockTribune.com. The post says it has been shared more than 363,000 times on Facebook, which flagged the story as part of its efforts to stamp on fake news in its users’ news feeds.
The article can be traced back to a Nov. 17, 2016, item on ConservativeDailyPost.com, but it has been shared on several other websites . It says a Republican has a new legal solution for dealing with liberal protesters — a law charging them with ""economic terrorism.""
The headline on the post makes it sound as if a law allowing terrorism charges for protesters is already in place. The body of the post implies the law is on a national scale.
That’s not an accurate description of what happened. The headline takes the core of a real event but builds a story full of incorrect details around it.
There’s currently no law on the books along these lines. Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen did suggest a bill criminalizing protests in the way described. The Republican proposed the measure in November , after protests erupted following President Donald Trump’s election. The idea was aimed largely at environmental activists in the Pacific Northwest who looked to shut down commercial and transportation projects in the region.
Ericksen said his bill would make protesting a felony were the protest to ""block transportation and commerce, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk."" There are already legal guidelines in place limiting protests — you can be arrested for harassing people, or blocking walkways, streets or the entrances to buildings, for example.
But Ericksen wanted to make the punishments much more severe. The ""economic terrorism"" charges could be levied against groups that organized such protests. Penalties would have included a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison.
""I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far,"" Ericksen said. ""Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account.""
Ericksen is serving as communications director for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of Trump’s transition team while also keeping his state office, drawing a recall effort from opponents.
But at the time the post was written, Ericksen was only proposing a bill penalizing protesters that harshly, and only in his state. That alarmed critics and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union .
He did eventually file a bill in the state Senate, but it wasn’t quite as severe as the one he originally suggested.
SB 5009 would impose prison terms on protesters who ""cause an economic disruption,"" ranging from 60 days for a misdemeanor and up to a year for a felony. One example to which he referred was of Washington protesters who blocked train tracks to two oil refineries in May 2016.
The bill is currently sitting in the state Senate’s Law and Justice Committee .
There’s no national law that brands protesters as terrorists. The headline makes a ridiculous leap to misrepresent the actions of a Washington state senator.",0,Bloggers
"""Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead"" A fake news story said that two Russian officials linked to an infamous dossier and a Russian nuclear agency were among the victims of a plane crash near Moscow that killed all 71 passengers.
""Russian source behind fake Trump dossier killed in Russian plane crash, Rosatom CFO also dead,"" read the headline on a Feb. 11, 2018, post on Puppet String News.
The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news.
The fake news story took a real plane crash and made up the names of some of those who died.
Consider the source: Puppet String News describes itself as created by a jaded U.S. Navy veteran who ""decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability.""
We found many things wrong with the post.
The story begins by citing an actual Business Insider story on Belarus-born businessman Sergei Millian as a key source in the Trump-Russia dossier , a 35-page report of opposition research on President Donald Trump, prepared by a former British intelligence officer who was hired by Trump’s Republican and Democratic rivals during the election.
Later, the Puppet String News story suggests Millian actually goes by the name Sergey Panchenko and died in the Russian plane crash.
Sergey Panchenko is listed on the passenger list released by Russian authorities, but Panchenko is a different person than Millian. The article also refers to Millian as being Russian, but he’s Belarusian . The name ""Sergei Millian"" is not listed at all in the list of passengers who were boarded on the plane. The story offered an unsourced photo of passengers' names who were on the aircraft with Panchenko highlighted.
Also killed off in this story is Ivanov Vyacheslav, who is credited with being the CFO of nuclear energy corporation Rosatom, the company at the center of the Uranium One deal . That deal involved the sale of a Canadian company with mining interests in the United States to Russia’s nuclear energy agency.
Vyacheslav did hold the CFO position at Rosatom until 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to the company website , the current CFO is Nikolay Soloman.
This Ivanov Vyacheslav was not on the plane, but a different man by the name was. The man killed in the plane crash was born in 1986, Snopes reported, whereas the former Rosatom CFO began studying for his degree in 1987.",0,PuppetStringNews.com
"""Barack Obama arrested in a Japanese drug bust."" A fake news story that said former President Barack Obama was busted for his links to a drug smuggling operation is part of an extensive and completely unsupported conspiracy theory popularized online.
A May 2, 2017, headline on AmericanFlavor.news declared, ""Just in: Barack Obama arrested in a Japanese drug bust."" The story was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake reports in its users’ news feeds.
The post was exceptionally short, saying that Obama had ""informed on his drug-dealing bosses,"" citing ""Japanese military intelligence.""
It explained that ""an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean."" Obama had been arrested for some unspecified connection to a ship that was carrying more than 4 tons of cocaine. The proceeds of the future drug sales were to fund ISIS, the post read.
The story is nonsense, because obviously Obama had not been arrested. And he was too busy negotiating $400,000 for speaking appearances to smuggle cocaine.
The AmericanFlavor.news post was the latest stop for a conspiracy theory that goes back a few weeks. The article linked to a YouTube video :
The video was created by Denise Stark , a conspiracy theorist who was citing an online radio show called Stillness in the Storm, a show its creators describe as ""an ongoing conversation about world events, hidden truths, and empowering information.""
Stillness in the Storm’s website linked to a blog post written by Benjamin Fulford, who on March 31 had written the piece that later appeared on AmericanFlavor.news. Stillness in the Storm had warned on its site that ""Fulford's claims should not be considered to be true without substantiation.""
Fulford, in turn, used his original post to link to a March 15 screed on WhatDoesItMean.com , a site rife with conspiratorial meanderings. The essay said that Obama had some nebulous link to a fishing boat called Lady Michelle, which had been busted in the Caribbean while smuggling cocaine.
The post was written by Sorcha Faal , the pseudonym of a conspiracy theorist with a series of posts on WhatDoesItMean.com. Faal’s post makes some pretty big leaps in logic, including that George W. Bush and Obama operated cocaine-smuggling operations and that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ordered their arrest.
The photo that accompanied Faal’s post was of a ship called Lady Michelle, which had been stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard off the shore of Suriname on Feb. 16, 2017.
Four Guyanese men were arrested for transporting 4.2 tons of cocaine worth about $125 million. There’s no mention of Japan, or any connection to Obama.

"Obama has admitted a cap and trade plan would cause electricity bills to ""skyrocket."" In her new book,  Going Rogue  , Sarah Palin said President Barack Obama's support for a cap and trade plan was ""misguided.""
""The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet,"" she wrote.
Here, we're looking at Obama's comments on electricity bills.
First, though, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't famliar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business.
We were familiar with Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008.
""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""
Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. ""The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said.
Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.
The latest version of the bill includes a number of measures to offset higher utility bills for consumers. Revenue from the permits would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers.
So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say.
There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income.
So the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly two years ago.
Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would ""necessarily skyrocket,"" and because Palin got Obama's words right, we give Palin a True.",1,Sarah Palin
"""When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58. It was 62 -- 62 for women."" To show that Social Security today is not what President Franklin Roosevelt intended when he signed it into law in 1935, talk show host Glenn Beck claimed that its creators may have designed it so many people would not live long enough to receive the benefits.
""When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58. It was 62 for women,"" said Beck. ""Wait a minute, when did benefits come in? At 65.""
His point was that Social Security was not meant to benefit as many people as it does today. Indeed, Beck went on to say that if Roosevelt had passed the law now, the starting age would be around 80 years old, due to longer life expectancy.
We wondered if Beck was right about life expectancy in the 1930s.
Indeed, he was correct. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency that tracks birth and death data, says that a man born in 1935, on average, lived until he was 60; a woman typically lived until she was 64. So Beck's claims of 58 and 62 were just off slightly. And Beck was correct that an average person would die before Social Security took effect.
What about Beck's implication that the age was chosen purposefully so that the majority of Americans would never recieve their Social Security benefits? Was FDR making this calculation?
Probably not, said Edward Berkowitz, a professor on Public Policy at the George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. ""I think that the age was chosen somewhat at random, certainly not to hedge actuarial bets.""
Berkowitz thought that an alternative explanation for the age choice was that the Germans had a similar program that the Americans used as a model. Berkowitz also pointed out that the median age might not reflect real life expectancy because the number was skewed by a large share of infant deaths. ""After you survive infancy, life expectancy goes up.""
Of course, we can't be sure what FDR was thinking, but for our purposes, Beck's statement is off by just a couple of years and his overall point is right that life expectancy was below the retirement age of 65. That's close enough to earn a True.",1,Glenn Beck
"""Clinton Foundation cargo ship raided at Port of Baltimore"" caught smuggling 460 undocumented immigrants. Fake news again targeted the Clinton Foundation with a story that falsely said a ship owned by the nonprofit was caught smuggling hundreds of people into the United States.
""Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret,"" read the headline on a May 11, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com , a site we know traffics in bogus news articles.
The secret, according to the story, was that 460 undocumented ""refugees from places like Yemen and Syria"" were hidden in 14 shipping containers aboard a ship called the Chelsea.
The story said some refugees told authorities they had paid $40,000 for passage to the United States. Some of the other containers, the post claimed, carried other contraband, like illegal fruit and several kinds of drugs.
The article was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake posts being shared in news feeds. It has appeared on other sites , as well .
The Clinton Foundation was recently the subject of fake news posts that falsely said Chelsea Clinton had been charged with fraud for essentially stealing from the nonprofit, which was shut down.
This particular fake story, like so many others, originated at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked . This story originally appeared on May 11 .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts.
The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.
One way to tell if the story is made up, beyond its absurdity, is a link allegedly to a CNN story that is actually to a Forrest Gump meme that reads, ""Are you stupid or something?""
Just to be sure, we contacted the Clinton Foundation, which said no, they didn’t own or operate any cargo ships.
The picture included with the original fake story is a crude Photoshopped image that really is a press photo of the Port of Baltimore . But the port also picked up on this fake story the same day it appeared, tweeting out :

"""Alabama state police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham."" Poll workers in Birmingham, Ala., allowed 3,000 invalid votes to benefit Democrat Doug Jones in his Senate race against Republican Roy Moore, according to a fake news article on Facebook.
""Alabama State Police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham"" stated a headline on the American Revolution website.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no truth to this article.
We saw no disclaimer on the American Revolution website, but the same story was posted on reaganwasright , a website that identifies itself as satire and is a frequent purveyor of fake news.
Jones beat Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. There have been multiple fake news reports related to the election.
This article on the American Revolution website contained no details explaining the supposedly fraudulent votes and contains some fictional details such as stating that Birmingham is in Applevale County -- it is located in Jefferson County.
It stated that the three poll workers  -- Wanda Werkmeister, Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown -- will all face felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in fines.
The article includes a quote by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but we found no evidence he said this:
""Without that inner-city ghetto vote, Doug Jones doesn’t have a chance. It doesn’t make much sense why someone from the city’s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren’t at all racist.""
The article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch’s show Guns God and Grits. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn’t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn’t have a show with that name.
The American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA. We sent a message to Special News USA via Facebook and a person replied stating, ""I do not know whether or not the news is correct or not, but I distributed it to get the feedback of other people.""
We found no news reports that poll workers were arrested in Birmingham.
Robyn Bradley Bryan, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that the agency did not arrest any poll workers.
A spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State, John Bennett, told PolitiFact that there were no poll workers with the names in the article.

"Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans ""choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy."" A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news.
A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, ""Paul Ryan: ‘22 million Americans choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy’."" Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news.
The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senate’s health care bill.
""What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it,"" Ryan said.
""So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want."" (We rated that Mostly False , because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.)
Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox’s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That’s where the story turned to fiction.
""Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it,"" Ryan is quoted. ""So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy.""
Ryan didn’t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan’s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes.
Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo , who runs sites based in Israel and Greece.
Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites.

But it isn’t always obvious that’s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all .

"""Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."" For all of the spending in Washington under President Barack Obama, the American people are not better off, Donald Trump argued in his July 21 speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination.
""President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing,"" Trump said. ""Yet what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third-world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.""
We wanted to fact-check his statistic about Americans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps.
SNAP benefits provide vouchers for groceries for qualifying low-income Americans.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, counted almost 43.6 million people in the program in April 2016, the most recent data available.
So Trump is on point, numbers-wise. But there’s a dollop more to the story.
The amount of people on food stamps, while considerable, is an improvement.
When Obama took office in January 2009, almost 32 million people received SNAP benefits. The number increased during the Great Recession as more families turned to the program for assistance, averaging an annual high of 47.6 million participants in 2013.
A report by the Food Research & Action Center, a hunger and nutrition advocacy group, applauded the 43 million figure in April as the lowest level of participants since October 2010. From April 2015 to April 2016, participation is down 1.9 million participants.
We explained in a previous fact-check that it’s unclear whether SNAP sign-ups would have been just as high under a Republican president, as the economy was weakening before Obama took office. The beneficiary pool was already increasing under President George W. Bush, whose administration broadened eligibility criteria and tried to get more Americans to apply for SNAP assistance.
The Republican policy platform approved at the RNC recommends breaking the SNAP program away from the USDA and the farm bill, under which funding for the program is usually negotiated in Congress. As an independent entity, SNAP would be more vulnerable to budget cuts.",1,Donald Trump
"""Trump: police officers and firefighters make too much money…hits them with tax penalty."" The new tax bill signed by President Donald Trump delivers some pain to police officers and firefighters, a viral story said.
""Trump: Police officers and firefighters make too much money ... hits them with tax penalty,"" said a Dec. 26 headline on Bluedot Daily , a website that is critical of Republicans.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Trump declared first responders make too much money. However, the tax bill signed by Trump in December did make changes in tax deductions that will affect many types of workers, not just police officers.
Most of the Bluedot Daily article lifts from an article in Salon that said in 2018, police officers or fire responders who buy uniforms, guns or ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs.
While Bluedot Daily made it appear that Trump targeted police officers and firefighters, Salon cited several types of workers who have taken the deduction in the past and will no longer be able to do so under the new tax law.
Salon said that nearly one in five taxpayers will no longer be able to use miscellaneous deductions, writing, ""Why are Trump and Congressional Republicans dinging first responders, teachers, nurses, traveling salespeople and even those who pay someone to prepare their income tax returns? So the rich can get bigger tax breaks, of course.""
Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact that the tax bill eliminated all employee deductions, including uniforms and union dues, for income tax purposes.
""Most employees did not itemize their employee expenses, so they did not deduct uniforms, etc.,"" he said. ""But some may have.""
The Bluedot Daily article said that under the new tax bill ""a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.""
That’s comparing apples and oranges, Rosenthal said. The tax bill eliminated employee deductions for income tax purposes, while the reference to corporate jets pertains to exempt amounts paid for private aircraft from an excise tax.
Rosenthal pointed to an analysis by the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker that explained that the provision provided clarity on a tax that was never successfully imposed on private jet management companies.",0,Bluedot Daily
"There is ""more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years."" In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the country’s progress toward energy independence.
There is ""more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years,"" he said. Later in the speech, he added, ""The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades.""
Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obama’s same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University. We rated it True after PolitiFact dug into the U.S. oil numbers. Here’s what we had found:
A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obama’s point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995.
We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report , the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day.
So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point?
Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports.
""Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,""Medlock said.
The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply.
Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University.
Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing.
We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines.
But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades.
Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards.",1,Barack Obama
"Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, ""If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?"" A fake news story that made Ohio Gov.

The headline on a March 28, 2017, post on WalkWithHer.com read, ""Kasich: ‘If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?’""
The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds.
Kasich allegedly made the remarks after vetoing the so-called ""heartbeat bill,"" a bill that would have outlawed abortion in Ohio once a fetal heartbeat could be detected. At the same time, he signed a bill that made abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal, unless the mother’s life was in danger.
The post, which is fake, said Kasich defended his actions by saying women weren’t as strong as they were in ""the old times."" They made poor decisions for themselves, including abortions, so Kasich had to take action, the article said.
""If a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion,"" the post quoted Kasich.
While Kasich did take those actions on both of those bills on Dec. 13, 2016, the quote attributed him is made up entirely, as is the rest of the story.
It’s another example of a story taken from Newslo.com, which first ran the parody post on Dec. 15 .

"""Mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs."" At the conclusion of a wide-ranging interview on NBC's  Meet the Press  , President Barack Obama said he was holding out hope that his beloved Chicago White Sox can still make the playoffs.
Host David Gregory asked him, ""On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All-Star Game wearing your Chicago White Sox jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?""
Obama replied, ""You know — I am — I think mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs.""
Here at PolitiFact, we're focused more on the American League East (Go Rays!), so we had lost track of how the White Sox were doing in the AL Central. We turned to our favorite baseball writer, Marc Topkin of the  St. Petersburg Times  , to find out if Obama was right.
Topkin told us that while the White Sox are out of the running to be the wild-card team for the American League, it's mathematically possible they could still win their division and then be in the playoffs.
As of Sunday morning when  Meet the Press  aired, the White Sox were 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers. Topkin told us the White Sox ""wouldn't be mathematically eliminated until there were 6 games left, and going into today they have 13 left.""
So Obama can hold out hope for at least another week or so. The odds are against the Sox — they play the Tigers and the Minnesota Twins, the No. 2 team in the division, in the next week. And Topkin noted that a lot of things have to break in favor of the Sox.

"""Pope Francis: Gun owners ‘can’t call themselves Christian’"" Did Pope Francis say that gun owners can’t call themselves Christians?

""Head of Catholic Church says those who own weapons are ‘hypocrites,’ not Christians,"" the article said. ""As pressure mounts to tear up the U.S. Constitution once and for all, Pope Francis has added to the sentiment by declaring that gun owners can no longer call themselves Christian.""
The link for the full text serves up a few more details on a separate website that paraphrases the pope saying that ""when people claim to follow the teachings of Christ but also support gun ownership, it leads to a bit of distrust.""
This is all a bit of a mashup of remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people.
Perhaps most important, the pope wasn’t talking about gun owners. He was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry.
""People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?"" he said, as reported by Reuters .
Notice that he didn’t mention gun owners. That was the invention of the web article.
The pope pulls no punches when he talks about war and arms makers.
In his 2015 address to Congress , he urged lawmakers to work to ""end the many armed conflicts throughout our world.""
And he added, ""Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.""
The New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasn’t, and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general. Plus, it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland, Fla., when in reality, his speech was three years old.

Trump in June 2017 did say he wanted new immigration rules that would bar new immigrants from public benefits for a period of at least five years. But as we pointed out back then, there’s already a federal law that does that.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 said immigrants who entered the United States on or after Aug. 22, 1996, would not be eligible for federal ""means-tested"" public benefits for five years, starting on the date of their entry into the United States with a status meeting the definition of ""qualified alien,"" which includes lawful permanent residents.
The law did outline several exemptions and said certain groups were not subject to the five-year restriction, including refugees and asylees, military veterans and active-duty military members, along with their spouses and unmarried dependent children.
The americatb.com post accurately cited remarks Trump made in an August 2017 weekly address : ""Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.""
Trump’s weekly address alluded to the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. Their bill does include a provision to prevent immigrants admitted under their proposed skills-based points system from receiving federal means-tested public benefits for five years.
But as fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have noted, while the RAISE Act tightens eligibility requirements, many would still remain eligible .
The RAISE Act’s provision also only applies to those admitted under the skills-based system, which as Cotton has said, currently represents a small fraction of immigrants legally admitted per year . (The RAISE Act also seeks to limit family-based immigration.)
Americatb.com’s post mixes in opinions and hypotheticals (""Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all"")  but no evidence to back it’s claim that Trump ""just ended welfare"" for immigrants.",0,Bloggers
"If it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is ""going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet."" On a recent episode of his HBO talk show, comedian Bill Maher said it was outrageous how much the Border Patrol is poised to expand due to an amendment to the Senate immigration bill.
Maher was referring to an amendment sponsored by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add ""19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border."" The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.)
If the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is ""going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy.""
A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did.
The bill is ""going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI""
The amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts , this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000.
The most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That’s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it’s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees.
Want an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies.
The FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment’s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.)
So, however you slice it, Maher’s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted.
""You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet""
According to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet.
Doing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher’s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate.
Needless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn’t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher’s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet.",1,Bill Maher
"""Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country."" During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, a member of the audience asked a question about the shortcomings of Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act -- President Barack Obama’s signature health care law -- is sometimes called.
In her answer, Hillary Clinton defended the law, citing its provisions to end barriers to obtaining insurance for those who have preexisting conditions, and ending lifetime limits on coverage.
""If we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody -- not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange,"" she said. ""And then we would have to start all over again.""
She went on to say that the practical consequences of the law have been strong. ""Now we're at 90 percent health insurance coverage,"" she said. ""That's the highest we've ever been in our country.""
Is she correct? Yes.
The most widely cited data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tabulates statistics annually on what percentage of Americans are covered by health insurance. The most recent report came out in September 2016, covering the year 2015.
The Census Bureau found that 90.9 percent of Americans had some type of health coverage, whether it was provided by their employer, purchased independently or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The remainder -- 9.1 percent of Americans -- were uninsured.
Here’s the key table from the report:
That was an improvement over the 89.6 percent in 2014, 86.7 percent in 2013, 84.6 percent in 2012 , 84.3 percent in 2011, and 83.7 percent in 2010 -- the year the Affordable Care Act was passed, although the law didn’t start having a major impact for another few years.
Meanwhile, between 1999 and 2009, the insured rate bounced from a low of 83.9 percent to a high of 86.9 percent, the furthest back the Census Bureau offers the statistic online. And at the time the 2015 data was released, it was framed as a record high for insurance coverage.
Looking at it the opposite way, the uninsured rate fell from 16.3 percent in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2015 -- a decline of nearly half over five years.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wouldn’t reveal just how high he’d raise income taxes on the rich during the Iowa presidential debate, but he guaranteed it wouldn’t be as much as it has been in the past.
In order to pay for making college tuition-free for Americans, Sanders said that Wall Street owed the middle class for bailing it out during the recent financial crisis. He said he would demand ""that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.""
""Well, let’s get specific, how high would you go?"" CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked. ""You’ve said before you’d go above 50 percent. How high?""
""We haven’t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent,"" Sanders answered.
Was the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure.
Before we go further, let’s review what the marginal tax rate means. It’s the tax rate that’s applied to the last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is based on brackets. The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket. Income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned.
We turned to the Tax Foundation’s federal income tax rates history , which documents figures going all the way back to 1913, when the income tax began with the ratification of the 16th Amendment.
During the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, from 1953 to 1961, the top marginal rate was 91 percent. (It was 92 percent the year he came into office.)
What does it mean, though? For the duration of Eisenhower’s presidency, that rate affected individuals making $200,000 or more per year or couples making $400,000 and above per year.
In 2015 dollars, that's roughly $1.7 million for an individual and $3.4 million for a couple.
Today the tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhower’s day. The top rate in 2015 is 39.6 percent , applied to single people making $413,200 or more per year, or married couples filing jointly making $464,850 or more annually. If we went back to 1954, single people making the equivalent of $413,200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket, while a couple making $464,850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket.
What’s the highest income tax bracket ever put in place? In 1944-45, during World War II, couples making more than $200,000 faced an all-time high of 94 percent.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""Actor Brad Pitt: ‘Trump is not my president, we have no future with this…’"" Brad Pitt has been critical of President Donald Trump, but he didn’t really say that ""Trump is not my president,"" despite what a clickbait headline claims.
""Actor Brad Pitt: ‘Trump is not my president, we have no future with this,"" reads the headline on conservativetown.com.
The article that followed offered a mash-up of real and fake details. But the story provided no evidence that Pitt said the lines attributed to him in the headline.
The blog post begins by saying the actor showed up as a meteorologist on The Jim Jefferies Show, ""stating some discouraging news about President Donald Trump pulling out the United States of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.""
Pitt indeed made a satirical cameo as an acting meteorologist on May 1, 2018, on The Jim Jefferies Show, a stand-up comedy segment on Comedy Central. But he made no mention of Trump or the Paris climate agreement.
When Jefferies asked for the weatherman’s forecast, Pitt referenced the melting ice caps.
""We’ve got sunshine in the West, the South, the East, and over here in the North, the ice caps are melting,"" Pitt said. ""And I am so, so, so, so, so scared.""
But on June 6, 2017, five days after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Pitt had another cameo where he told Jefferies, ""There is no future.""
The line was met with audience laughter and applause.
We searched for articles using Google and the Nexis database that mentioned Pitt saying ""Trump is not my president,"" but we did not find any documented examples.
Pitt has made comments critical of Trump, which were wrongly attributed to his Jim Jefferies appearance on the post. In an interview with novelist Marlon James that appeared in the New York Times Style Magazine on Sept. 7, 2016, Pitt said, ""Man, I never thought Brexit would happen.  Same way I can’t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge.""
""A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything,"" Pitt said later in the interview. ""What does he even mean, take our country back? Would someone please explain that to me? Where’d it go?""",0,Bloggers
"""President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status."" A news story that asserts President Donald Trump’s feud with the National Football League led him to revoke the organization’s nonprofit tax status is a trick play created by a fake news website.
The headline on an Oct. 9, 2017, post on ConservativePaper.com read, ""President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status.""
Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news stories. The same story appeared on several other websites reported by Facebook users .
The story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL’s ""401(c)(3) status ‘until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.’ "" (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, which has raised Trump’s hackles in recent weeks.
Now, it may surprise some to know that the NFL’s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit — a tax classification for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, professional football leagues . The change in the tax code was granted in 1966 , to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws.
The league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league’s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations.
But the league voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015 after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes.
""As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. ""The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt.""
U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act , looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by changing the tax code .
Trump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, when he tweeted , ""Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!""
But he didn’t sign any executive order rescinding the league’s tax status, which it had voluntarily changed already.
The fake story appeared to originate two days before Trump’s tweet, in an Oct. 8 post on FreedomJunkshun.com , which looks to be member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.
FreedomJunkshun.com uses the same website architecture as other Blair - affiliated sites , and carries a disclaimer that reads , ""All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.""

"David Hogg graduated from Redondo Shores High School in 2015. A viral image of a since-deleted tweet said David Hogg, one of the victims of the Parkland, Fla., shooting, graduated from a California high school in 2015.
We’ve previously debunked the theory Hogg is a crisis actor, but we decided to take a closer look at the purported yearbook evidence.
""I went to school with him at Redondo Shores High School and he graduated in 2015,"" the tweet said . ""Here he is in our yearbook from 2015. He always wanted to work for CNN and be an actor. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain""
But the image accompanying the tweet is taken from the 2017 Stoneman High School yearbook.
Joey Wong, a student at the Parkland, Fla., high school, posted a video of his yearbook on Twitter showing the cover and the page from the viral image.
""Okay, so, what we have here is a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School yearbook from the school year 2017, Florida, and bookmarked is David Hogg’s yearbook photo from the same book,"" Wong says in the video. ""David Hogg, 11th grade. This is last year. He’s right here. That’s him.""
Another student, Sarah Chadwick, echoed Wong’s confirmation in another tweet .
""She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????"" Chadwick tweeted .
Hogg did not graduate from a California high school in 2015; in fact, he was on the cross country team at Stoneman that year. The Sun-Sentinel published a photo of one of his races .
Hogg did, however, live in California prior to Florida. His father, Kevin Hogg, was an FBI agent assigned to the Los Angeles International Airport before his retirement to Florida in 2014.

"Clinton said ""great things about NAFTA until she started running for president."" In Ohio, where union workers are a major presence and the manufacturing economy is hurting, Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. Hillary Clinton for her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, called NAFTA.
""Yesterday, Sen. Clinton also said I'm wrong to point out that she once supported NAFTA,"" Obama said. ""But the fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president. A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, 'I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York state and America.' ""
The Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong, that Clinton was critical of NAFTA ""long before she started running for president.""
We looked into Clinton's past remarks on NAFTA and concluded that she has changed her tune, from once speaking favorably about it to now saying the agreement needs ""fixing.""
The agreement goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign when Bill Clinton ran against incumbent President George H.W. Bush. On Aug. 12 of that year, Bush finished negotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would support NAFTA if elected, but would demand supplemental agreements to protect worker rights, the environment and sudden import surges.
After Clinton won the presidency, his administration negotiated the side agreements and made NAFTA one of its top priorities. Vice President Al Gore memorably debated Ross Perot about NAFTA on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Congress approved the agreements, and it was hailed as a major political victory for the new president.
As first lady, Hillary Clinton publicly supported her husband's position. In 1996, in a visit with unionized garment workers, she said the words Obama now quotes. ""I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth,"" said Clinton, according to an Associated Press report.
Clinton wrote positively of her husband's efforts on NAFTA in her memoir ""Living History,"" published in 2003:
""Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal.""
During a 2004 teleconference on funding cuts for job training, Clinton was asked whether NAFTA should be revisited. She replied, ""I think that we have to enforce the trade rules that are inherent"" in NAFTA. ""I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada,"" she said.
Today, Clinton's campaign Web site says plainly, ""NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises.""
At a debate hosted by CNN in November 2007, Clinton said, ""NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout.""
We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically. However, this is not a point Clinton made in her own autobiography, where she wrote in favor of NAFTA.
Now, there's the issue of whether Clinton changed her mind because she was running for president. Clinton surrogates say she made remarks against NAFTA as early as March 2000 when she was running for Senate in New York. We could not confirm those remarks independently. But, as we've noted, she made pro-NAFTA remarks as late as 2003 (her autobiography) and 2004 (a teleconference).
We won't say Clinton was a huge cheerleader for NAFTA, but she did speak favorably of it. And now she says it needs to be fixed. Was running for president the cause of this switch, or was it a gradual change of thinking? It's hard to say; the balance of evidence does not point to a harsh pivot point. But when we balance her previous statements against her more recent statements, we find that she has changed her sentiments when she speaks about NAFTA.",1,Barack Obama
"Says ""the Kardashians donate whopping sum to Las Vegas mass shooting victims"" It’s not true that the Kardashian family has donated $1 million to Las Vegas shooting victims, despite a post on HoustonChornicle-tv.com claiming it to be a fact.
An undated post on HoustonChronicle-tv.com claims the reality TV family ""will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.""
Fifty-nine people were killed and more than 500 injured during an Oct. 1 concert on the Las Vegas Strip after a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, across from the concert venue.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed (and minimally altered) a statement to the Kardashians that was actually said in August by the chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Co. after committing to give $1 million to the American Red Cross to support Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts.
""Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic storm,"" Disney’s Robert A. Iger said in his statement. ""It’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because it isn’t over yet. But we know thousands of people have lost everything and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.""
Below in bold is how HoustonChronicle-tv.com modified the quote.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com claimed Kim Kardashian said: ""Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting.""
It adds that the family said: ""It’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.""
The post also claims Khloé Kardashian tweeted, ""Las Vegas we are praying for you,"" immediately after announcing the family’s donation.
Khloé Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted condolences after the Las Vegas shooting and said ""My prayers are with you!"" but she did not write the specific words claimed by HoustonChronicle-tv.com.
Kim Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted : ""Woke up to the most devastating news about Las Vegas. I’m praying for everyone in Las Vegas!"" She also tweeted and retweeted about gun control and violence and about the need for blood donations in Las Vegas.
Kim Kardashian on Aug. 29 tweeted that her mom, sisters and her would be donating $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army USA to help with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. But there have been no official reports or tweets from her or her family about donations after the Las Vegas shooting.
HoustonChronicle-tv.com also claimed the Kardashians would be hosting a ""Day of Giving"" on Oct. 7 ""to benefit those impacted by the shooting."" That also mimic's Disney’s August press release after Hurricane Harvey, which said that on Aug. 31 it would ""host a ‘Day of Giving’ to benefit those impacted by the hurricane.""

"Say Gretchen Carlson said, ""The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented."" Clickbait websites love to make up fake quotes for celebrities and controversial politicians, hoping to mislead readers into clicking into their content and seeing their ads.
For instance, we recently fact-checked a post accusing former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn’t say; we rated it Pants on Fire .
Now, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually true .)
The claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, "" Gretchen Carlson: ‘The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented .’ ""
Within days, the item was picked up and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One version got 31,400 shares through July 24.
The accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated.
""Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?"" she asked on air. ""Can’t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?""
These comments drew opposition from gun-rights supporters. It’s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication.
The article reads, ""Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that ‘the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?’ ""
This would be a ridiculous claim if she’d actually said it.
As schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. ( Here’s an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. ("" A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed ."")
Indeed, the history of firearms goes back even further than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written.
The first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightists.com website. On the site’s "" About Us "" page, a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightists.com ""is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers. Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!""
Of course, this warning isn’t noted on the actual page the Carlson story appears on.
We also couldn’t find any credible news source reporting Carlson’s words as cited in therightists.com article.
Finally, we checked with Carlson’s office. In a statement, her office confirmed that the article was ""total B.S.""
Bottom line: Carlson did not say, ""The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented."" The accusation that she did rates as Pants on Fire.",0,Bloggers

Obama is accurately describing his health care plan here. He advocates a program that seeks to build on the current system, rather than dismantling it and starting over.
Obama's plan essentially takes today's system and seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It creates national pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it has several strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care.
Obama has said he would like his plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage. But currently it includes a mandate only for children. Obama has said that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.
It remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the cost savings it promises for the health care system. But people who want to keep their current insurance should be able to do that under Obama's plan.",1,Barack Obama
"""Clinton campaign official arrested by FBI on child rape/trafficking charges"" A new outrage is bubbling on social media, this time over the arrest of a 22-year-old man on charges of attempting to sexually exploit a child, enticing a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing child pornography.
The charges have made news for several outlets — including the Washington Post — because the perpetrator was a well-known activist working to prevent sexual violence. Before his arrest, Joel Davis was the founding executive director of the international organization Youth to End Sexual Violence and a member of the International Campaign to Stop Rape & Gender Violence in Conflict , an international group of human rights experts.
But some conservative websites have tried to attach another, unsubstantiated label to Davis, writing that he worked as a ""campaign official"" for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
We found no evidence to support this claim.
""Clinton campaign official arrested by FBI on child rape/trafficking charges,"" said a June 27, 2018, headline from Puppet String News, an ""alternative news"" source, according to its about page. The Puppet String News report cited an article from blog site True Pundit, which in turn linked to a story from Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper. Several other blog sites with histories of peddling falsehoods online published similar articles.
Both Puppet String News and True Pundit said Davis worked for Clinton’s election campaign.
""Child trafficking is now exposed as officially embedded within the Clinton campaign, as Clinton for 2016 campaign staffer Joel Davis has been arrested for raping children and trying to meet up with children as young as two,"" the Puppet String news story said. ""The Clinton campaign literally just had a top staffer arrested on child rape/trafficking charges by the FBI … you can only bet it goes all the way to Hillary Clinton and obvious top aides.""
The Daily Mail story — the likely source for both inaccurate reports — made no such claim, but did include a photo from Davis’ Facebook page that showed the university student wearing a Clinton campaign pin and standing in front of multiple Clinton campaign posters. The three others in the photo can be seen holding clipboards and folders, but Davis’s hands are empty, save for a cup of coffee.
A caption attributed to the photo by the Daily Mail said, ""He's with her: Davis posted this picture after Hillary Clinton's election defeat, suggesting he had campaigned for the 2016 loser.""
Davis was allegedly committing the same crimes he was outwardly fighting, according to a Justice Department press release . Davis texted undercover FBI agents sexually explicit photos and videos of children and said he wanted to have sex with children of any age, according to the federal criminal complaint .
And, Davis was a Clinton supporter to some degree. In what he called ""the only post about #election2016 I'm going to write,"" Davis wrote in a Nov. 9, 2016, Facebook post that ""felt betrayed"" by the election result because he had been living ""inside a liberal bubble.""
But Davis never indicated that he had worked for Clinton, and even if he had, campaigning for Clinton is not the same as being a ""campaign official"" or a ""top staffer.""
We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any credible reports connecting Davis to Clinton. We also checked Davis’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and found no mention of the campaign.
Seemingly, the only evidence to support the claim that Davis worked for the Clinton campaign is a photo showing him and three others with Clinton campaign pins and posters. (Puppet String News did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger.)
That does not make him a top Clinton aide, staffer or official.",0,Bloggers
"Says a celebrity praises locals for their help after an automotive breakdown. According to a raft of faux news websites, Bill Murray sure does appreciate the people of Rochester, N.H., for helping him after his rental car broke down.
If you believe the Internet, he’s also fond of the residents of Marion, Ohio . And Shakopee, Minn. , too. And Hays, Kan. ; Porterville, Calif. ; Prescott Valley, Ariz. ; Bay City, Mich. ; and even Toowoomba, Australia . All for the same reason, none of which is true.
A website called NewsDaily12.com said it had the story from Rochester , in which Murray is quoted from an unidentified radio interview as saying he was leaving the New England town when his rental car ""overheated or something."" Facebook flagged this story and others as part of its efforts to identify fake news.
They’re right. It’s fake.
Murray’s undated anecdote continues that while on the phone with the car company, a couple of locals lent a hand, calling a family member with a tow truck and taking the car to get repaired. While waiting, one of the Samaritans offers to take Murray to lunch, the story goes.
""So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester — some place called Wild Willy’s — and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too,"" Murray is quoted. ""These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly. I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire.""
The stories, which again, are fake, are part of a chain of websites that appear to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. These sites carry names that sound like official media outlets, like ""KMT 11 News"" or ""16 WMPO.""
The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. Other stories include that a celebrity is moving to a certain town or, say, that the next Star Wars movie is being filmed nearby.
None of the stories specifically say the article is fake. But each site has a disclaimer (if you know where to look) that says the articles ""are simply works of satire meant for entertainment purposes"" and shouldn’t be considered true. (Claiming that these articles are somehow satire is bogus, too.)
Each site says readers may submit concerns to a contact email, and the administrators ""will offer you our condolences and provide you with a safe space where you can be shielded from any sort of satire in the future.""
We emailed them looking for condolences, but so far have received none.
Every version of the story on each site is almost identical, with the name of a different town. The lunch destination is either changed or omitted altogether, depending on the version. (To the fake news purveyor’s faint credit, the name of the restaurant used is of an actual place in the specific town — there really is a burger joint called Wild Willy’s in Rochester, for example.)
Something that also changes in the stories is the name of the celebrity having the experience. It’s not always Bill Murray.
It also turns out that Adam Sandler had the same problem in Pflugerville, Texas . And Billings, Mont. ; plus a flat tire in Reynoldsburg, Ohio ; and a whole host of other towns .
Tom Hanks got a flat tire in Kennewick, Wash. ; Harrison Ford’s car overheated in Mandan, N.D. ; Miley Cyrus broke down in Hollister, Calif . Other celebrities helped by gentle townsfolk after some bad luck include Jennifer Aniston , Morgan Freeman , Woody Harrelson , Adam Levine , Matthew McConaughey and Bruce Willis . There are scads of small towns and suburbs named as the location of these hapless incidents.
Needless to say, there is no evidence that any of these celebs had car trouble in any of these places or subsequently praised locals for help.",0,Bloggers
"""New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed."" A former New Jersey police chief made a series of alarming racist comments about African-Americans, according to an article on Facebook.
""New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed,"" stated a Nov. 2 headline by Truth Examiner, a clickbait liberal website that largely posts articles critical of Republicans, including President Donald Trump.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. But in this case, the information is based on actual federal criminal hate crime charge against Frank Nucera, Jr., a former police chief of Bordentown, a New Jersey township.
The website attributes the information to CNN , which reported about the case against Nucera.
Here’s a summary of the case, according to the federal criminal complaint filed Oct. 31.
Nucera frequently used racial epithets against African-Americans and called for violence against them.
In or about November 2015, when Nucera suspected that a previously arrested African- American individual had slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera stated to a subordinate officer:
""I wish that n----- would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I'm tired of them. These n------ are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow them down. I'd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it.""
The incident that led to the charges occurred Sept. 1, 2016, when the Ramada Hotel called to report to police that two individuals had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and had been swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon. The suspects, both African-Americans, were an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old woman.
The suspects resisted arrest, and one of the officers used pepper spray, but the suspects were ultimately subdued and handcuffed.
While the male suspect was no longer resisting, Nucera grabbed his head and slammed it into a metal doorjamb. Nucera also used his arm to strike the suspect’s neck or head.
Within hours of the alleged assault, a police officer recorded Nucera making racially hostile statements regarding the suspects and African-Americans in general.
Nucera retired as chief shortly after the federal government informed the New Jersey attorney general of the pending investigation.
Nucera appeared in court in November 2017. A federal grand jury indicted Nucera on Dec. 7 for allegedly violating a man’s civil rights by using excessive force during an arrest.
We contacted Nucera’s lawyer and did not get a reply. In a Dec. 22, 2016 interview with FBI agents, Nucera denied touching the male suspect, according to the indictment.
The headline stated, ""New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed."" A federal criminal complaint states that Nucera expressed those opinions; the case is pending.",1,Truth Examiner
"""Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child."" A fake news story claimed evangelical leader Kenneth Copeland said Christians who don’t support President Donald Trump could face punishment from a vengeful God, who would potentially give the unfaithful a homosexual child.
An April 7, 2017, post on AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com carried the headline, ""Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child.""
The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected it may be fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds.
The post said Copeland, the head of Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries , understood that Trump was not perfect, but leaders are chosen by God and must be followed in accordance with God’s will. What would happen if Christians don’t obey?
""If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God,"" the story quoted Copeland as saying. ""Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.""
Of course, Copeland didn’t say this, because the story is fake.
Copeland did support Trump prior to the election, and served as one of the billionaire’s faith advisers during the presidential campaign. He also told followers in October 2016 that there would be consequences for skipping a vote for Trump.
""You’re going to be guilty of murder,"" he said on a TV program . ""You’re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You’re going to be guilty of every baby that’s aborted from this election forward.""
AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com didn’t indicate its post was fake, but the site is known to carry bogus stories. We tried to contact the website through their contact form, but did not get a reply.
It appears that the site took the story (rearranging it a bit) from a parody site called BizStandardNews.com. The original post was dated Aug. 10, 2016 , before Trump became president, and didn’t refer to him as the chief executive.
The Business Standard News, complete with a ""BS"" logo, noted that it made up its stories.
""The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle,"" the site said on its "" About "" link. ""The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.""
That BizStandardNews.com story also included references to evangelical Trump supporter David Barton, the founder of the group WallBuilders .
Barton did say on on Aug. 10 that Christians would ""answer to God"" if they didn’t exercise their God-given responsibility to vote, supporting Trump. References to Barton were edited out of the version appropriated by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.
But again, Copeland didn’t say God would punish Trump opponents by affecting the sexual orientation of their offspring. The quote was made up by a parody site and reused by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.",0,Bloggers

""BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II Dead At 94,"" said a May 9 headline by The Liberty Raise . The story appears to be copied from The Daily World Update , a website that purports to be satire.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .

There is no truth to this headline or story. First off, the queen is 92 years old, not 94. But more importantly, the queen is not dead.
If the queen had died, it would be reported by legitimate news outlets, like the BBC or the Guardian. And there would likely be a post about it in press releases of the official website of the British Royal family (which is teeming with news about the birth of Prince Louis and the impending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry).
In reality, on the same day this hoax published, the queen was actually at the Royal Windsor Horse Show where she was pictured smiling.
When the queen does pass away, it will be the ""most disruptive event in Britain in the last 70 years,"" according to Business Insider.
""For at least 12 days — between her passing, the funeral and beyond — Britain will grind to a halt,"" the article said . ""It'll cost the British economy billions in lost earnings.""
There was one recent death in the royal family: the queen’s dog, Willow. Willow, the 14-year old corgi was put down in April following a battle with cancer. Willow’s death was particularly significant, as it was the last in a long line of royal corgis.",0,The Liberty Raise
"""Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as ‘hate speech’"" In the lead-up to the Fourth of July holiday, Facebook removed a post containing sections of the Declaration of Independence as hate speech. Stories detailing the incident have been gaining traction ever since, so we decided to examine what happened.
""Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as ‘hate speech,’"" said a July 5, 2018, headline from Geller Report, a website run by Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist and commentator.
""It’s not surprising,"" the story said. ""The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda. The left means to criminalize lawfulness. The left means to criminalize freedom of speech. The left means to criminalize individual rights. The left means to criminalize Americanism.""
What the story does not tell you: Facebook said removing the post was an accident and restored it a day later.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Geller Report cited an article from the Guardian, and Geller pointed in an email to multiple other outlets that also reported on the incident, including the  Washington Post ,  USA Today ,  Fortune  and the  Independent .
Here’s what happened: In anticipation of July 4, the Liberty County Vindicator, a small local newspaper in Texas, posted sections of the Declaration of Independence to Facebook.
The Vindicator soon received notice from Facebook indicating that one of the posts was removed because it ""goes against our standards on hate speech,"" according to a July 2 write-up from Casey Stinnett, the paper’s managing editor. Stinnett said the section was likely removed for its reference to ""merciless Indian savages.""
""The removal of the post was an automated action,"" Stinnett wrote. ""If any human being working at Facebook were to review it, no doubt the post would be allowed.""
Later, Stinnett updated the article and posted to Facebook to announce that the post had been restored. He said the Vindicator received an email from Facebook that said, ""It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn’t go against our Community Standards. We want to apologize and let you know that we’ve restored your content and removed any blocks on your account related to this incorrect action.""
Geller acknowledged in her email that Facebook apologized and restored the post, but her story did not mention the apology or the fix.
""We restored the post and apologized to The Vindicator on July 3 as soon as we saw our error,"" said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook. ""We process millions of reports every week, and sometimes we make mistakes.""
This is not the first time Facebook’s censors have removed posts of historical significance. In 2016, Facebook suspended one user’s account after he posted an image of The Terror War, a Pulitzer-prize-winning photograph that depicts a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. The photo, removed as nudity and child porn, was eventually restored.",1,Bloggers
"""We're spending millions for each individual"" held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On his second day in office in 2009, President Barack Obama ordered that the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be closed within a year.
But it remains open nearly six years later, largely because of a difficulties figuring out what to do with the detainees who remain there.
On CNN’s  State of the Union Dec. 21, 2014, host Candy Crowley asked Obama if the detention facility will be closed by the end of 2015.
""I’m going to be doing everything I can to close it,"" Obama said. ""It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held. It is contrary to our values, and it is wildly expensive. We’re spending millions for each individual there.""
We wondered: Are American taxpayers spending millions of dollars per year for every detainee held in Cuba?
In 2002, the United States established a detention camp on the 45-acre naval base on Cuba’s south east coast to hold suspects in the war on terror. More than 750 people have been detained in total over the past 13 years, with 132 current detainees. About 2,100 people work there. So how much does it cost?
For fiscal year 2014, the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is $397 million, according to a Department of Defense report drafted for the Senate Intelligence Committee. This includes money spent on maintenance, personnel, contracted work, military commissions and Department of Defense-funded studies.
Spread out among the 155 people detained over the course of 2014, that’s about $2.6 million per detainee.
In 2013, with a similar-size budget but more detainees, the cost worked out to about $2.7 million per detainee.
For comparison, inmates at high-security federal prisons cost about $34,000 per year on average, as of 2012 .
Part of the reason holding detainees at Guantanamo is so much more expensive than other prisons might be transportation costs, said Madeline Morris, a law professor and director of Duke University’s Guantanamo Defense Clinic. Most people, food and supplies have to be brought in by air, which is an enormous cost.
The number of detainees is going down, but the facility may face extra costs in the future. In August 2014, the New York Times reported that an estimated $200 million in maintenance will be necessary in coming years to keep the detention facility functioning. The infrastructure was originally built to be temporary.
One aspect of Guantanamo that doesn’t cost very much is the land. In 1903 , then-President Theodore Roosevelt secured the area from Cuba for $2,000 a year, paid in gold -- worth about $4,085 today. The American government continues to pay the rent each year, but the Cuban government reportedly refuses to cash the checks.",1,Barack Obama
"Says Barack ""Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House."" A fake story that claimed President Barack Obama was installing a pricey statue of himself in the White House before he left office has gone bust under a smidge of scrutiny.
""Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House,"" read headlines across several websites in January. The latest version we saw was on Jan. 18, 2017 , two days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, but there were many other examples .
The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers’ news feeds.
In the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled ""statute,"" as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue ""permanently erected in the entryway of the White House,"" the article asserted.
Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office.
Clearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House.
The source of this false account is a Dec. 31, 2016, post on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is ""intended for entertainment purposes only,"" and that its content can’t be reproduced without consent .
We didn’t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets.
There is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it’s not anywhere in the White House.
It’s along the ""avenue of heroes"" near Puerto Rico’s Capitol building in San Juan, where the statue was installed in 2012 . Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a trip to the commonwealth in 2011 .
The image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is dated Jan. 8, 2013 .
It looks like hoaxsters combined the statue image with a photo of the Oval Office.
But even the background is not the Oval Office. It’s really a photo from the U.K.’s Mirror of a replica created by a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade .
Wade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office at 80 percent scale . The composite doesn’t even feature Obama’s decor — the absence of his chunky mica coffee table was the giveaway.
While EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there’s no evidence of that in the faux story. That’s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit.

"ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air. A misleading claim that circulated online after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been retrofitted for the Trump era.
The claim is that ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air in response to the current political climate.
""Yesterday the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia,"" reads an article on a website called Politifeed. ""Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about ‘causes.’ ""
This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
We found no credible evidence to back up the headline.
Old claim, updated for Trump era
Here’s a sliver of accuracy contained in the article: ABC News has had a longstanding policy that forbids reporters from wearing any lapel pins, according to top executives.
However, virtually everything else about the claim is wrong.
The policy applies to ""any lapel pins of any sort,"" not just American flags, former ABC News president David Westin told CNN.
The policy was also in place prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to Westin’s description of the policy (hat tip to our friends at Snopes for flagging the 2012 interview):
""We’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort,"" Westin said. ""The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly (after the 9/11 attacks), ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision.""
According to a Snopes fact-check from October 2001, ABC News was singled out because a nationally syndicated article suggested the network’s policy made it an outlier among news networks at a time of heightened patriotism.
Thus spawned the false claim about ABC News enacting a new policy banning lapel pins in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.
Now the claim has been updated to make it appear the ABC News’ ""ban"" (in truth, a longstanding policy) is a response to Donald Trump’s presidency.
The political conditions may have changed since the claim was first born, but it is still untrue.
As an aside, we’d note that the older claim that President Barack Obama sought to ban American flag pins is an extreme distortion of reality .",0,Bloggers
"""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."" In a recent Medium post , Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country.
""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,"" Pitts wrote. ""Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.""
We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look.
The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together.
In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses.
That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.
The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths.
Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That’s close enough for us.
We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent.
So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms?
According to CDC , there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions.
So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts’ second claim correct.",1,Joe Pitts
"""Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma."" On April 7, reports emerged from Syria’s civil war that residents of the city of Douma east of Damascus were potential victims of chemical weapons. The reports have yet to be confirmed, but footage of women and children foaming at the mouth threaten to draw a military strike by Western forces.
The California-based non-interventionist website Antiwar.com posted an article saying the Syrian Red Crescent, which is a member of the international Red Cross/Red Crescent federation, rejected the idea of a chemical attack.
""The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma,"" the April 9 article said . ""The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.""
PolitiFact contacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (the organization typically includes the Arab designation) to confirm the statement.
""We are not aware of such a declaration,"" said Rana Sidani Cassou in the Beirut office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""Neither the Syrian Arab Red Crescent nor the International Federation are in a position to confirm or deny any attack.""
In fact, during the April 7 attack, Syrian jets had targeted the Syrian Red Crescent hospital in Douma and the next day, the group tweeted that the Douma branch had shut down.
When we contacted Eric Garris, director of Antiwar.com, the website retracted the article, and posted a new one with the headline "" Report of Syrian Red Crescent Statement on Alleged Douma Attack Incorrect .""
Garris told PolitiFact that they based the original story on an article that appeared April 8 on the Russian-state sponsored news website Tass. That article said the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement.
We can’t verify that. The Tass article quotes doctors who work with the Syrian Red Crescent talking about an attack that took place in January. Garris said his news editor believes Tass might have changed the article from the version he first saw.
Garris said his group moved ahead with the story, even though he did not find confirmation on the Syrian Red Crescent website.
""I have no excuse for letting it slip through like this,"" Garris said. ""We should have been more diligent. There’s enough misinformation out there, and we don’t want to be a part of that.""
The retraction said, ""In the future, we will not use foreign news sources as the sole source for important articles like this.""",0,Antiwar.com
"Says President Donald Trump ""signs a visa-free travel policy"" for Ghana and Malawi. As President Donald Trump’s travel ban upended many people’s plans to come to America, fake news perpetrators saw opportunities to cash in on the news. A few days after Trump signed his executive order, a website called USA Television put up two stories.
One said "" Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Ghana "" and the other "" Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Malawi ."" The website claimed that ""the United States President, Donald Trump, has signed an executive order to allow all Ghana nationals travel to the United States without visas."" Substitute Malawi for Ghana and the two articles were identical. They even included ""news"" that Trump was on the verge of revoking Australia's visa waiver status.
This is, however, nonsense.
The U.S. State Department oversees the visa waiver program , and lists the eligible nations. Neither Ghana nor Malawi is on that list. In order to qualify, the visa refusal rate for a given country (meaning how often the U.S. refuses a visa request) has to be under 3 percent. The latest refusal rates for Ghana and Malawi are about 62 and 14 percent respectively.
USA Television not only gets zero points for accuracy, it ranks low for creativity. The theme of Trump lifting visa requirements created a cottage industry of sorts. The earliest version we found was on a website called MetroWorlds . On Jan. 25, 2017, the site reported that Trump had signed a bill that granted waivers for Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia. The website Lead Story flagged that as fake news. It is.

"""Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!"" Southwest Airlines is known for its cheap deals -- but a deal to fly for free?
""Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!"" states a headline circulating on Facebook on soutwest-air.com .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. A Southwest Airlines spokesman, Dan Landson, confirmed that it is a scam.
The phony website promotes a deal that promises that viewers have been ""selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Southwest Airlines Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!""
Upon completion of the survey participants get a message: ""Congratulations! You won 2 Free tickets at Southwest Airlines!""
But don’t expect those tickets to ever arrive.
""A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, it generally is,"" Landson told PolitiFact.
Landson pointed to a few signs that this is fake news: the airline’s official website is Southwest.com while this website is sout-west.com.
The date written as ""27. November 2017"" is also not a format that Southwest uses.
""And, we never just give out free tickets,"" Landson said. Landson said Southwest is in its 47th year, not its 50th. (Landson originally said the airline had celebrated its 48th birthday, which is incorrect.)
There’s been some type of scam like this floating around for several years. (We found an example of the scam reported in the Miami Herald in 2011). A similar previous version offered travelers free first-class tickets to a ""dream destination"" and $5,000.
Graham Cluley, a security analyst, wrote about the repercussions of such a scam in 2016.
""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam.""
Consumers can get actual information about Southwest at 1-800-I-FLY-SWA or Southwest.com.
So the headline that states ""Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!"" is a scam. Similar versions have circulated for years.",0,soutwest-air.com
"""There's never been a (U.S. Supreme Court) vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years, lasting longer than 237 days."" In the political wrangling over whether President Barack Obama should appoint a new Supreme Court justice or wait until his successor is sworn in next January, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued on MSNBC's Hardball that a delay goes against modern precedent.
The Democrat said that failure to fill the seat could mean a lot of tie votes on the court, which could ""really hurt people. And so there’s a duty to fill that vacancy, to make the system work.""
""Our constitutional system depends on nine members serving on the Supreme Court, which is why there has never been a vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years lasting longer than 237 days. The president has 339 left.""
We wondered if Blumenthal was correct, and why he was limiting his analysis to the past 30 years.
Using the Supreme Court's list of justices and their terms , we counted the gap between the date each justice left office and the date their successor was sworn in, beginning with justices who were on the bench in 1900.
We found Blumenthal's 237-day gap. It began when Lewis F. Powell Jr. retired on June 26, 1987 . It took nearly eight months to find a replacement. Ronald Reagan's first choice, Robert Bork, was rejected by the Democratic Senate, mostly along party lines. His second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after admitting he used drugs, both as a college student and later as a professor at Harvard.
Anthony Kennedy, Reagan's third choice to fill Powell’s seat, was confirmed without opposition by the Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. He was sworn in Feb. 18, 1988.
We found a longer vacancy, though it falls outside of Blumenthal's 30-year window.
When Justice Abe Fortas resigned on May 14, 1969, 391 days passed before his successor, Harry Blackmun, was sworn in on June 9, 1970. That was nearly 46 years ago.
Once again, a Republican president -- in this case, Richard Nixon -- failed to get his first two nominees approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate, although neither vote was on strict party lines.
Like Kennedy, Blackmun was confirmed without dissent . Blackmun ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the court.
In all, of the 59 vacancies that occurred in the 20th and 21st centuries, only four persisted longer than 200 days. Six were between 150 and 200 days.
The average time between a justice's departure and his successor being sworn in: 73 days.
Two things to note. Justices don't always get sworn in as soon as they are confirmed. John Hessin Clarke was approved by the Senate on July 24, 1916 , but he wasn't sworn in until nearly three months later. Also, justices sometimes announced their resignations months before they step down from the bench, so their departures could take effect the day before or the same day a successor is sworn in.
In the case of the 237-day gap cited by Blumenthal, Powell is listed as leaving the court the day he announced his resignation.
Blumenthal was talking about the length of vacancies, not the gap between an announced departure and the swearing-in of a new justice. And on his specific timeline, he is correct.",1,Richard Blumenthal
"""Melania Trump: 'If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out.' "" No, the first lady did not really issue a threat to former President Barack Obama over the safety of her son.
A headline on Yournewswire.com fabricated the quote in a clickbait headline: ""Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out.""
Facebook users flagged the Nov. 23 post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Yournewswire.com is a fake news website .
In this case, the article is not entirely fictional because it was based on a threat by an ISIS supporter. However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama.
Yournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington Free Beacon , which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the Middle East Media Research Institute , an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a social media network .
Here’s what the group reported:
On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag ""handle the son of the mule of America,"" the supporter, who uses the name ""Dak Al-Munafiqeen,"" Arabic for ""striking the hypocrites,"" wrote: ""Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington."" The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.
The report drew scant mainstream media attention . While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director.
""It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,"" he said.
The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact.
""The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn’t make it a significant threat,"" he said. ""Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.""
Where the YourNewsWire.com story really goes into fake territory is the idea that Melania Trump responded to the threat by saying ""if ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out."" We could not find any evidence that she responded at all.
We contacted YourNewsWire.com and received a reply from the editor in chief, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who said PolitiFact is ""policing the internet as part of a a faux moral crusade on behalf of the Clinton regime.""",0,YourNewsWire.com
"""CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face"" An online hoax smashed together a 2015 comment by Donald Trump and a comedian’s roast of the Trump administration to make up a story about CNN.
""CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face,"" said an April 29 headline by Daily World Update .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
On April 28, comedian Michelle Wolf hosted the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in which she made fun of press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Part of Wolf’s remarks were interpreted as a jab at Sanders’ appearance; she indirectly referred to her as a softball coach dividing the press corps into teams, and that Sanders ""burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye."" Trump, as well as some members of the press association, criticized Wolf’s remarks .
The Daily World Update wrote that Marvin Schmidt, a supposed former CNN co-host, was fired after he defended Wolf’s remarks.
""Look at that face,"" Schmidt said in an alleged now-deleted tweet, The Daily World Update wrote. ""I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?""
That quote was actually made by Trump in a Rolling Stone interview in 2015 when speaking about GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina.
""Look at that face!"" he cries. ""Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!"" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ""I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?""
CNN has no co-host named Marvin Schmidt, a CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin told PolitiFact. She said the story was fabricated.
The Daily World Update story includes a photo of three people on CNN, including a black man in the middle with a red circle drawn around his face suggesting that he was the alleged Schmidt who was fired. We searched for the photo in Google Images and found that it matched a panel of guests on CNN in February 2016 about the reaction to Beyonce’s album Formation. The black man on the panel was Bakari Sellers , a CNN commentator and a former South Carolina state representative. Sellers told PolitiFact that he hasn’t spoken on CNN about Wolf’s speech to the White House Correspondents Association.
The Daily World Update describes itself as satire. But this story hardly meets that definition. The website is l inked to a frequent purveyor of such hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money.  The post Facebook users see would give little clue to the fact that the story is made up.",0,Daily World  Update
"Romney said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants. On several occasions, Mitt Romney has criticized former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for supporting a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Arkansas high schools to be eligible for in-state tuition rates at state schools.
Romney, on the other hand, has said repeatedly that he opposed a similar measure when he was governor of Massachusetts. He does so in a television ad. That claim is accurate.
Romney vetoed a bill in 2004 that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Massachusetts high schools to pay in-state tuition at state-run colleges and universities.
""I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state,"" Romney said at the time. ""But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal.""
In 2006, the Massachusetts legislature tried to pass the measure again in order to override his veto, but was unsuccessful.

"""Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget."" The presidential candidates argued about the economy and fiscal policy at a debate on Oct. 7, 2008, in Nashville.
Barack Obama criticized John McCain's talk of earmarks, saying that cutting earmarks would not significantly affect the federal deficit.
""Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget,"" Obama said.
Fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt — which is now more than $9-trillion in total — often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem.
According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year’s deficit of $318-billion.
The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct.",1,Barack Obama
"""When we got the income tax in 1913, the top rate was 7 percent. By 1980, the top rate was 70 percent."" During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said, ""When we got the income tax in 1913, the top rate was 7 percent. By 1980, the top rate was 70 percent.""
Is she correct?
We turned to the website of the Tax Foundation, which has a document that lists every tax bracket since the imposition of the federal income tax in 1913.
It turns out Bachmann is right.
In 1913, the federal tax code levied income taxes ranging from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the top rate of 7 percent levied on incomes of $500,000 and above (or the current equivalent of $11,332,304). At that time, there were no distinctions in filing status, such as individuals or married filing jointly.
By 1980 -- just before Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency -- the top rate was 70 percent for all filing categories. The top rate kicked in at $108,300 for individuals and $215,400 for married couples filing jointly, or $294,907 and $586,546, respectively, in today’s money.
For comparison’s sake, the top rate today for all categories is 35 percent. And the top rate was actually higher before the 1980 level of 70 percent that Bachmann cited. For every year between1944 to 1963, the top tax rate exceeded 90 percent.",1,Michele Bachmann
"""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law."" President Barack Obama touted the success of Obamacare during his final State of the Union address.
He said the Affordable Care Act has led to nearly 18 million more people gaining health insurance and has helped to slow health care cost inflation. He added that the law didn’t destroy the job market, despite pessimistic predictions from critics.
""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law,"" Obama said on Capitol Hill on Jan. 12, 2016.
We hadn’t heard that particular Obamacare talking point before, so we decided to take a look.
Because Obama referred specifically to ""our businesses,"" we looked at private-sector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act .
Of the 70 months since, Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growth. That’s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker .
This graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010:
From early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth.
The fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics’ argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law.
For example, in a January 2015 fact-check , we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time.
But independent studies haven’t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., that Obamacare is ""job killing"" False .
Former Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in 2014 that Obamacare is ""expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."" We rated that claim Mostly False .",1,Barack Obama
"Greece ""has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex."" During the May 9, 2010 edition of ABC's This Week, commentator George Will sought to add some context to one of the previous week's biggest stories -- the financial troubles in Greece, which prompted a bailout by its European neighbors that drew protests in Athens and shook financial markets across the world.
This Week host Jake Tapper introduced the topic by asking Will, ""Why should the American people care about this?""
Will responded, ""Because it's an early heart attack that ought to alert us to the fact that we could have a bigger heart attack. Greece is not too big to fail -- it has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. It's too connected.""
We wondered whether the Dallas-Fort Worth's gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced -- could really be larger than that of an entire European nation.
According to the World Bank, Greece's gross domestic product in 2008 was $355 billion, ranking it 26th in the world.
Meanwhile, statistics calculated for the same year by the U.S. government's Bureau of Economic Analysis determined that the metro area consisting of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, Texas, had a gross domestic product of $379 billion -- close enough in our view to make Will's statement correct.
Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington actually ranked sixth among highest-GDP metro areas in the United States. Will could have just as easily pointed to five other metro areas that have bigger GDPs than Greece -- the ones based (in ascending order) in Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. New York City's economy, in fact, was about three and a half times the size of Greece's in 2008.
Just to be sure, we also compared statistics for GDP adjusted by ""purchasing power parity"" -- a tweak that eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities. The adjusted GDP for Greece is $330 billion, which is smaller than Greece's unadjusted GDP, but only by a modest amount. (The adjusted GDP uses the U.S. as its yardstick for comparison, so its GDP number does not change.)",1,George Will
"""With those first principles, it allowed a fellow like me to get in his truck and go from one end of the state to the other; started 20 points down and wound up 20 points ahead on election night."" Yes, it's true. Fred Thompson combined his folksy charm (the truck) with a set of conservative principles (less government, lower taxes, more free markets) to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1994.
And, indeed, in February of that year Thompson trailed Democrat Jim Cooper by 19 points — 36 to 17 percent — according to polling at the time by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research.
Thompson went on to win the race, which was a special election to complete the term of Al Gore who became vice president, with 60 percent of the vote to Cooper's 39 percent (a 21 percentage-point spread). Thompson won re-election to a full term two years later, defeating Democrat Houston Gordon, 61 to 37 percent.
The truck played a role for the lobbyist and actor. He leased it to campaign in the state, building his down-home bona fides among voters.
In the same speech Thompson also pointed out, correctly, that President Bill Clinton won Tennessee twice. But it's worth noting that Thompson's first victory, 1994, came in a tidal wave year for Republicans, who took control of Congress.
""That was kind of a watershed year in Tennessee,"" said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon.",1,Fred Thompson
"Says that under his tax plan, seniors making less than $50,000 per year won't pay any income taxes. In a new 2-minute TV ad, Barack Obama explains his economic plans and contrasts them with John McCain's. In two other Truth-O-Meter rulings, we examined Obama's claims about his plans for small businesses and the middle class. Here, we'll address his plan for senior citizens.
He says in the ad that ""seniors making less than $50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won’t pay income taxes at all.""
That is correct. Obama's tax plan specifies that he would ""eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year."" The campaign estimates it will cut taxes an average of $1,400 for 7-million seniors.
It's worth noting that Obama's proposal has been criticized on several fronts.
Some economists have questioned whether it's a wise policy because seniors already receive favorable tax treatment. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research group, said Obama's plan would create inequity by eliminating taxes for senior citizens who earn a modest income but continuing to tax younger workers earning the same amount. Also, it would help seniors who are currently paying income taxes but provide no benefit for those too poor to owe any tax.
Still, Obama accurately describes his plan in the ad.",1,Barack Obama
"""You ... said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief."" Trying to challenge Sen. Barack Obama’s preparedness to be president, Gov. Sarah Palin used Sen. Joe Biden’s own words against him.

Indeed Biden did. In an Aug. 19, 2007, debate among Democratic hopefuls, moderator George Stephanopoulos pressed Biden whether he stood by a recent quote that Obama was “not ready” to be president.
Biden said he stood by it.
It’s worth noting that in May 2008, Biden changed his tune. “He’s learned a hell of a lot,” Biden said.

"""By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family."" Words, words, words. President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His recent speech on economic issues , in which he backed a minimum wage increase, included more than 6,500.
But what about a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap affects young children?
""By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she’s already behind,"" he said.
Just for comparison’s sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches.
But did he get his fact right? We’d never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look.
When we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid 1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley.
They published their findings in a book,  Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children . Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language.
They found a 30 million ""word gap"" by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That’s one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the ""achievement gap,"" a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing.
The word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She’s also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative , one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research.
""This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life,"" Suskind said.
Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it’s ""pretty well-accepted"" as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately.
Suskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there’s variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don’t.
""No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed,"" she said. ""You can’t generalize economic groups.""",1,Barack Obama
"""ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist’"" Just about everyone wants to see world peace. But the idea that the bad guys are just going to lay down their weapons has long been a powerful source of ridicule.
In a post dated May 24, 2017, but which seemed to gain steam on social media in early September, the website Babylon Bee said that the terrorist group variously known as ISIS or the Islamic State had given up its fight just because American singer Katy Perry had called for co-existence in an interview.
In an article headlined, "" ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist,’ "" the website wrote, ""Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ‘The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.’ ""
The article raised red flags at Facebook, and we’re fact-checking it here as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news.
It’s not so obvious on the page showing the ISIS-Katy Perry article, but the Babylon Bee is a satire site. At the bottom of its home page , there’s a line that reads: ""The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.""
A glance through other headlines on the site does confirm that the site runs fairly obvious satirical articles that often have religious themes. For instance, the site ran one article about Texas-based megachurch pastor Joel Osteen headlined, "" Lakewood Church Issues Eclipse Glasses For Gazing At Joel Osteen’s Teeth ."" Another article was headlined, "" Heaven Department Of Tourism Advises 2018 Round-Trip Tickets Selling Out Fast""
So the Babylon Bee is more openly satirical than some other examples we’ve been forwarded by Facebook, but we’ll still confirm for the record that ISIS did not, after all, stop fighting for an Islamic caliphate just because Katy Perry suggested it.
The genesis of the joke, as Snopes.com has noted , comes from comments Perry made on the Elvis Duran Morning Show on May 23, 2017, one day after a suicide bombing inspired by ISIS killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena in England during a concert by pop star Ariana Grande.
In the interview, Perry said: ""I think the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people, as fan bases, all of it, you know? Whatever we say behind people’s backs – because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go – but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. And no barriers, no borders – we all need to just co-exist.""
(Footnote: Perry later performed with Grande at a benefit concert for the Manchester victims.)
Some conservative commentators on social media mocked Perry’s remarks as geopolitically naive, though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers, not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy.
For instance, a Fox & Friends tweet touted commentator Michelle Malkin’s remark that Perry's call for ""no barriers, no borders"" typifies the ""liberal mindset of celebs who don't operate in reality.""
Perry responded to Malkin through a pair of tweets . ""@michellemalkin The media has edited my words out of context, I was talking about online fan culture and how we must unite now. ... Maybe didn't say it perfectly but, I don't always get it right. Would love to speak with you in the future.""
Either way, the story in the Babylon Bee reflects pretty obvious satire, not reality.",0,Babylon Bee
"""We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend."" Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.
""The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense,"" Conrad said. ""That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.
""So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way.""
Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012.
We wanted to check Conrad's statement that ""we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend."" We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check .
We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent.
We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way:
""It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference,"" said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
In rating Conrad's statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it's spending.",1,Kent Conrad
"""The Alternative Minimum Tax...was created by Congress in 1969 to affect 155 wealthy Americans. Because it was never indexed for inflation, those original 155 taxpayers has increased to affect about 3.5-million in 2006."" On Jan. 17, 1969, Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr told Congress that 155 taxpayers making $200,000 or more did not pay any taxes on their 1966 income.
That shook lawmakers into creating the alternative minimum tax in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. It was created as separate income tax system to ensure people did not use loopholes to avoid paying any taxes at all.
Because of the law, people who are able to use deductions and legal shelters to lower their tax bill too much must pay a minimum income tax, the AMT. Under the law, taxpayers who meet the AMT threshold must pay the higher tax bill, whether it's their actual bill or the AMT.
The trouble is that, unlike the standard income tax system, the AMT is not indexed for inflation. So as time moved on, growing numbers of people have fallen into the AMT program and, as a result, are paying higher taxes.
In 2006, 3.5-million taxpayers fell under the AMT, which equates to about 4 percent of American taxpayers, according to the Congressional Research Service. But that was with a special limit — ""a patch"" — imposed by Congress.

"""BREAKING Trump Removes Muslim Federal Judge For Trying To Implement Sharia Law In America"" The first line of an online hoax about a federal judge, President Donald Trump and Sharia law is all you need to read to figure out the entire post is fake.
""22nd Circuit Court of Appeals Justice Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith made headlines this week when he overturned a ruling out of Dearborn, Michigan,"" said the opening line to the Feb. 28 webviners.com story, headlined ""BREAKING Trump Removes Muslim Federal Judge For Trying To Implement Sharia Law In America.""
The problem is, there is no 22nd Circuit Court of Appeals. There are only 13 appellate courts below the U.S. Supreme Court — 12 Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Federal Circuit Court. And there is no Judge Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith.
Overall, the story claims that a judge ""allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law"" to be practiced in the United States and that Trump used his executive power to remove him from the bench.
Here’s a breakdown of the story and how separated it is from reality.
""When asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states,"" the story claimed.
But as fellow fact-checkers have noted , there is no ""systematic infusion clause,"" and the 14th Amendment largely deals with citizenship rights.
""President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution, reports As American As Apple Pie,"" the story continues.
However, the website asamericanasapplepie.org is not a source of accurate news.
That website’s About page claims everything posted on its site is fiction. ""It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.""
Webviners.com’s story also uses different names for the supposed judge, at times calling him ""Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith,"" ""al Allalawaralahali-Smith"" and ""Alallaha-Smith.""
The Feb. 28 post is a variation of other stories debunked in 2017. Previous fake news posts claimed it was ""Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith"" who ruled in favor of Sharia law in the United States.
PolitiFact Texas reported that in November 2017, the Facebook page for Sid Miller , the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a post from a website called trumpsolidsupporters.me, which made the same fake news claims as webviners.com did in February 2018.
The link to trumpsolidsupporters.me remains on Miller’s Facebook page, yet an amended description for the link says: ""Well it looks like I may have been duped. This may be fake news, but I still think Sharia law has no place in the United States of America.""

"Says a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they ""can’t afford"" Obamacare. A story shared on multiple websites about a New York couple who committed suicide because they couldn’t afford to pay for health care is the result of news outlets that at first wrote the pair left a note saying as much, but later walked back the claim.
A July 28, 2017, post on NewsBreaksHere.com said a 53-year-old Manhattan chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife had jumped out of a high-rise window together, leaving a note that read, ""We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.""
The post noted that the suicide came ""just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare,"" but that three members of the GOP had voted no, defeating the measure and keeping the Affordable Care Act in place.
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news.
There was a double suicide in midtown Manhattan on July 28, according to the New York Post . Glenn Scarpelli and Patricia Colant jumped from the ninth floor of the building where they worked, leaving behind a 19-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter.
The husband and wife also did leave a note, which read, ""We had a wonderful life."" But the couple was deeply in debt. The New York Post reported a lien showed they had owed more than $23,000 in federal taxes, and as of April 2015 they had more than $232,000 in debt. Scarpelli had faced legal action in 2013 for not paying back a $60,000 student loan.
The ""financial spiral"" in which they were trapped was too much for the couple, who elected to jump to their deaths, the Post reported. There was no mention of medical costs, or health insurance premiums, or anything else related to the Affordable Care Act.
So where did all these posts mentioning health care costs come from?
Initial versions of the New York Post’s story apparently cited a law enforcement source that said there was a second note at the scene. That note reportedly read, ""We both have medical issues, we just can't afford the health care.""
Later versions of the story corrected that assertion , saying a New York Police Department spokesman refuted that detail, and that there was no mention of health care costs in the couple’s sole suicide note.
Several posts on different websites cited a version of the story from the U.K.’s Daily Mail , which appears to have included the same details and also was updated. Neither story indicates what was changed in the text during the subsequent updates.
Using an uncorrected and incomplete version of the story led those posts to highlight the erroneous assertion that medical expenses, whether through high insurance premiums or procedural costs, drove the couple to suicide.",0,Bloggers
"Says a photograph shows Seattle Seahawks player Michael Bennett burning the United States flag. A photograph plastered on a Facebook page that allegedly supports President Donald Trump purported to show an NFL player burning an American flag in the locker room, but it has very clearly been manipulated.
An image posted on the ""Vets for Trump"" Facebook page on Sept. 28, 2017 , showed Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett shirtless and holding a United States flag that has been set ablaze. Teammates, coaches and staff appear to be cheering Bennett on in the background.
""#Seattleseahawks - no more NFL,"" the caption on the post read.
Commenters were outraged by the photo, with one person declaring ""burning the Flag that I shed my blood to honor would be just cause to whack you upside your ignorant disrespectful head."" Another ironically wrote that he ""couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture.""
The Vets for Trump Facebook page didn’t accept messages or list phone or email information. It listed as contact information the website VeteransForDonaldTrump.com , a domain registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets .
Trump targeted the NFL after a handful of players had decided to kneel during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, as a protest against racism in America. Trump demanded on Twitter that NFL players "" stop disrespecting our Flag & Country "" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand.
More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either).
But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day.
Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke.
The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016 , and is credited to Rob Mar on the team’s website .
For the record, Bennett did speak out on the Trump controversy. He said at a CNN town hall event on Sept. 27 that the protests were ""about treating people like human beings.""
""The changes start with the heart,"" he said. ""This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing. Change the culture.""
Trump’s feud has led to other fake claims beyond this one. We previously checked claims that the NFL fined Steelers players $1 million each and that Fox Sports refused to broadcast games "" until players respect the flag ."" We rated both Pants On Fire!
That’s the only thing burning about this claim, too.",0,Vets for Trump
"""Social Security ... is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever."" In answering a debate question about the future of the Social Security system, U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich accurately described the lifespan of the popular program.
""You know, of course we ought to be raising the cap in order to protect Social Security, which is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever,"" he said. U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton also referred to that date.
Indeed, the most recent report by Social Security actuaries concludes that 2041 is the year when the system would run out of money. To be sure, while the system is ""solid"" until then, that doesn't mean it doesn't need attention.
If no changes are made, as Kucinich says, the annual cost of paying out benefits will exceed the payroll tax money flowing in by 2017, according to the 2007 report from Social Security actuaries. From that point forward, benefit payments would come out of the Social Security trust fund. The year 2041 is when all those assets would be exhausted.
The cap Kucinich mentions is a limit on the amount of salary that is taxed for Social Security. Right now, that cap is at $97,500, but Kucinich said he supports raising it to tax more income.
In 2007, the program had 50-million beneficiaries and 163-million covered workers and their families.",1,Dennis Kucinich
"""Obama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General"" A website calling itself USA NEWS uses outdated and unfounded information to falsely claim that former President Barack Obama has announced a bid to become the United Nations’ secretary-general.
An April 12 post on the website usanews24h.tk said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year.""
""Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year,"" said the story posted in April, more than a year after Obama left office.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
Several other elements in the story show that the post is not rooted in current events or facts, including a line that says ""U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility."" Ban, the UN’s eighth secretary-general, ended his term Dec. 31, 2016 .
The claim that Obama sought to or intended to become the UN’s secretary-general has been around for several years .
USA NEWS’ post includes several sentences that first appeared in a Jan. 8, 2016, post on the Washington Times. That 2016 story attributes its information to a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Jarida.
A Jan. 12, 2016, editorial in the Washington Times also references the Kuwaiti newspaper, adding that ""rumors are floating back from the Middle East"" that Obama ""is sounding out Democrats, Republicans and friends of the United Nations in the United States to help him get the job of secretary-general of the U.N.""
The editorial acknowledges that the rumors ""might be just another imaginative fairy tale of the Arabian night. The Arab media is addicted to such tales. But Mr. Obama was once described by Bill Clinton as a fairy tale, too, and here he is, completing his second term, and Mr. Obama does not suffer excessive modesty.""
In January 2016, Israeli media also reported on the Kuwaiti newspaper’s claim, but not without casting doubt on the information. ""The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources,"" israelnationalnews.com reported .

"""Two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy."" Mitt Romney discussed his detailed economic proposals at a Republican debate in Boca Raton, Fla., prefacing his comments with the need to get money into the hands of people who will spend it.
Speaking favorably of the Bush stimulus plan, Romney said, ""What's effective is, first, he's getting money back to consumers. And given the fact that two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy, getting money back into the hands of our citizens, a lot of them paying a lot for gasoline, a lot for heating oil, a lot of people concerned about how to make ends meet, that makes sense to me.""
It made us wonder: Two-thirds of our economy geared to consumption? Is that true?
Consumption includes pretty much everything we spend our money on. The major components of consumption include things like food, apparel and services, transportation, health care and entertainment.
The latest data available from the third quarter of 2007 show that personal consumption expenditures in the United States made up 70 percent of the gross domestic product, with a split of 7.7 percent for durable goods, 20.4 percent for nondurable goods, and 41.9 percent for services.

"Says ""(Barack) Obama’s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud."" Former First Grandma Marian Robinson just can’t catch a break from fake news.
First Michelle Obama’s mother was wrongly accused in fake stories of drawing a federal pension for taking care of grandchildren Sasha and Malia. Now she’s the victim of a new round of false reports that claim she’s being charged with a crime for doing so since former President Barack Obama left office.
""Obama’s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud,"" reads the headline on several Internet posts that started appearing on or after March 16, 2017 . The posts all read roughly the same, claiming that Robinson was charged ""for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses.""
The story stokes reader ire by admonishing Robinson for attempting to take money she didn’t deserve.
""While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters’ ‘caretaker,’ she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name,"" the posts read.
Several of these links were flagged by Facebook users for being potentially fake, as part of the social media company’s efforts to prune fake news from readers’ news feeds. The various links that repurpose the same post have been shared on Facebook at least 17,000 times.
We know this particular claim is fake, because it comes from a website that makes up its content.
It was originally posted on March 16 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked . These kinds of posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
Moreover, the whole idea that Robinson was at all eligible for a federal pension for being a caretaker of the former first family’s children is entirely wrong.
Robinson was a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to Michelle Obama and her brother Craig. She did move into the White House in 2009 , and has helped raise her granddaughters . But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. Since she was never a federal employee, she doesn’t qualify for any government pension.
The post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is building on a claim from October 2016 that originated on BostonTribune.com. That website said Robinson was allowed to collect the $160,000 pension once the Obamas left the White House.
Despite the story being shared on several other fake news sites, there’s no actual pension for Robinson to collect. We rated that statement Pants On Fire !
TheLastLineOfDefense.org report appears to acknowledge there is no pension for the first grandma (or at least not a legal one). Instead, the post unleashes outrage over Robinson’s alleged attempt to collect money not owed to her.

"""Since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans."" Although the Feb. 25, 2010, televised health care summit was billed by President Barack Obama as an attempt to forge some bipartisan agreement, it didn't take long for the talk to turn to reconciliation.
Reconciliation is a legislative procedure adopted in 1974 to balance budget bills. It can be a complex process, but what you really need to know about a reconciliation bill is that it can be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote supermajority Democrats lost when Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate. In other words, it's an option some Democrats are mulling if a bipartisan plan cannot be achieved.
In the Republicans' opening statement, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said, ""You can say that this process has been used before, and that would be right. But it's never been used for anything like this. It's not appropriate to use to write the rules for 17 percent of the economy."" Alexander quoted Alexis de Tocqueville that the greatest threat to the American democracy would be the tyranny of the majority.
Soon after, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of having a bit of amnesia on reconciliation.
""No one has talked about reconciliation, but that's what you folks have talked about ever since that came out, as if it's something that has never been done before,"" Reid said. ""Now, we as leaders here, the speaker and I, have not talked about doing reconciliation as the only way out of all this. Of course it's not the only way out. But remember, since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans for major things, like much of the Contract for America, Medicare reform, the tax cuts for rich people in America. So reconciliation isn't something that's never been done before.""
We'll set aside some of the hypocrisy here (see Reid's comments in 2005 when he talked about the ""arrogance of power"" when Republicans were mulling reconciliation). Similarly, we'll set aside the hypocrisy of Republicans who used reconciliation in the past, but now denounce it.
The issue we're looking at here is whether Republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than Democrats, as Reid claimed.
On Nov. 14, 2008, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put out a report on reconciliation bills between 1981 and 2009. There have been 22 of them, including three that were vetoed by President Bill Clinton. It's been used for health insurance portability (COBRA), nursing home standards, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increases in the earned income tax credit, welfare reform, start-up of the state Children's Health Insurance Program, major tax cuts and student aid reform.
While some have tallied the Republican vs. Democratic report card on reconciliation based on the president in power at the time, we think it makes more sense to look at the party in power in Congress when the reconciliation procedure was initiated.
By our count, eight of the reconciliation bills were initiated by a Democratic-controlled Congress. The rest, 14, were done by a Republican-controlled Congress.
So by that measure, Reid is on target.
""It's a legitimate argument,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""And Reid is absolutely right. It has been used a lot, and more by Republicans than Democrats.""
On April 20, 2009, Mann co-authored an article in the New Republic, ""Truth and Reconciliation: Sidestepping the Filibuster,"" along with Molly Reynolds, also of Brookings, and Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, which concluded that ""Health reform 2009 style would be the most ambitious use of reconciliation but it fits a pattern used over three decades by both parties to avoid the strictures of Senate filibusters.""
Still, we think looking at all 22 reconciliation bills casts too wide a net. Many reconciliation bills were not even all that controversial, and enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But other ones have clearly involved policy decisions that otherwise would likely have failed. Only eight involved votes where the winning side had less than the supermajority threshold of 60 votes. One could argue those were the times when Congress got around the need for the standard 60 votes. But even among that smaller group, six of the eight came courtesy of a Republican-controlled Congress.
By way of counterpoint, Brian Darling, director of Senate relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that any comparison of past reconciliation bills to one on health care is flawed.
""This is a unique situation,"" Darling said. ""It's completely unprecedented to use reconciliation to amend a bill that is pending in Congress but has not passed.""
Darling called the Democrats' threat of reconciliation a measure of last resort to steamroll through a bill that can no longer get 60 votes in the Senate and is unpopular with the American public.
Whether or not a reconciliation bill on health care meets the intent of the legislative procedure is certainly a matter for legitimate debate. But Reid said reconciliation has been used 21 times since 1981, and that most of the time, it's been Republicans who have initiated it.",1,Harry Reid
"""Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet’ "" A phony story on Facebook says American actress Julia Roberts insulted former first lady Michelle Obama after a visit to Roberts’ New York film production studio.
""Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet,’ "" stated a Dec. 14 headline on USA Daily Portal , which linked to the full story on yet another website, brightstars.me .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is the same as one on yournewswire.com and was previously debunked by Snopes .
These articles are fake news and appear to be a riff on a USA Today editorial that criticized Trump after his tweet Dec. 12 calling U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ""a lightweight senator ... who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them.""
Some interpreted Trump’s tweet as veiled language that Gillibrand would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, although White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed that characterization because she said he used similar language about men.
USA Today’s editorial board reacted to Trump’s tweet: ""A president who’d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama’s presidential library or to shine George W. Bush’s shoes.""
The fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme.
USA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts’ film, Roberts commented about the differences between America’s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been ""looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country"" while ""doing a brilliant job,"" and Michelle Obama ""isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet.""
The statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump.
We found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion.
In fact, Roberts has supported national Democrats in recent years including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
In October 2016, Roberts was one of several Hollywood and Broadway stars to team up to hold a fundraiser for Clinton at the St. James Theatre in New York. Wearing a ""Hill Yeah"" t-shirt, Roberts read from the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins .
Roberts also appeared at Democratic fundraisers hosted by Obama, including a Santa Monica fundraiser on in April 2016 and one at Gwyneth Paltrow’s home in 2014.

"""Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud"" A website misleadingly claimed that the Sunshine State has pushed for a recount of presidential election results, citing widespread voter fraud.
""Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud,"" read the headline of a Dec. 6, 2016, post on BipartisanReport.com.
While the post itself recounts a real news story about a lawsuit claiming voter fraud in Florida, the headline is inaccurate enough to give people the wrong impression that a potential recount is underway.
The Tallahassee Democrat reported on Dec. 5 that three Florida residents had filed a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet and Florida’s 29 Republican electors. The website also cites the same story in the  Detroit Free Press .
The filing alleges that the state’s election results were invalid, contending that voting machines malfunctioned or were hacked, many votes went uncounted and mail-in ballots weren’t included, among other problems. The suit aims to force a recount of votes by insisting Hillary Clinton would have won the election had there been no alleged impropriety.
Trump won Florida by almost 113,000 votes, and there has been no proof of ""massive voter fraud."" The election results were certified on Nov. 22 , with only ""minor problems"" reported by election officials.
Despite what the headline implies, state officials have not pushed for a recount. Under Florida law, a recount is triggered if a candidate wins by 0.5 percent or less. Trump’s margin of victory over Clinton was about 1.4 percent .
A voter may file a lawsuit to contest the results within 10 days of the results being certified. The results can be contested if there’s a suspicion of fraud or corruption, a candidate being ineligible, a dispute over vote totals or bribery.
With the assistance of a left-leaning Washington-based group called Protect Our Elections , the trio of plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on Dec. 2, the final eligible day to contest the results.
The Facebook post of the report did mention the lawsuit, also noting ""Trump is NOT happy."" But there’s a good chance he won’t say anything about the lawsuit at all. Even Orlando attorney Clint Curtis, representing the plaintiffs in the recount lawsuit, acknowledged the action may produce zero results before the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19.

"Says Philando Castile ""had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident."" Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine brought the tense intersection of law enforcement and race into the center of the vice presidential debate. Kaine accused Pence of being afraid to confront the issue of bias in police, but Pence denied that he was afraid.
Kaine pressed the issue with the story of Philando Castile, the Minnesota man shot to death by a police officer during a traffic stop for a broken tail light. The gruesome incident was streamed live on a Facebook video by Castile’s girlfriend.
""They called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked,"" Kaine said. ""The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.""
We know the larger point Kaine was making and we’ve checked that before (True). But we wanted to vet his number for how many times police stopped Castille.
According to the Associated Press, Kaine is correct.
The AP reported on June 9, 2016 , that Castile ""had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.""
The report also found that about half of the charges against Castile had been dismissed.
A similar investigation by NPR found 46 stops. And NPR noted ""Of all of the stops, only six of them were things a police officer would notice from outside a car — things like speeding or having a broken muffler.""
Minnesota offers a rare glimpse into broader patterns of law enforcement and race. In 2001, the Legislature commissioned a study by the Institute on Race and Poverty, a center overseen by a University of Minnesota law professor. That study ultimately included 65 jurisdictions. The results published in 2003 showed several disturbing patterns.
Law enforcement officers stopped black, Latino, and American Indian drivers at greater rates than whites, searched them at greater rates than whites, but the rate of actually finding illegal goods was less for minorities than for whites.
In a press release, the lead study director Gavin Kearney said, ""The pattern for blacks and Latinos existed in nearly every participating jurisdiction.""
Shortly before Castile was shot, he had told the officer that he had a permit to carry a weapon.",1,Tim Kaine

"A picture shows former President Bill Clinton naked with another woman. A website called the Political Insider is publishing fake news of a leaked photo of former President Bill Clinton sitting naked next to a woman massaging his back.
The image in question is part of a British contemporary artist’s portfolio of placing celebrities and prominent figures in compromising situations. We've included it below, but be warned, it's a bit jarring.
""The Clintons are Finished Forever After Dirty Picture LEAKS! (NSFW),"" the website wrote Nov. 15, 2016.
The post says the images are not confirmed, but then goes on to speculate who the woman is and surmises that both the person in the image and Clinton are left-handed: ""If that’s not Bill Clinton, it sure looks like him.""
The post tracks back to the Twitter account of a user named 0Hour.
In reality, the image was cropped and lifted off the website of contemporary artist Alison Jackson . Here is a screengrab of the full image from her website:
And here is how Jackson describes her work.
""Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.""
Jackson also has portrayed President-Elect Donald Trump as part of work for  Vanity Fair . She has a new book with her images, entitled Private 2016, available on Amazon .
Through a spokeswoman, Jackson told us that she is ""delighted one of my works is part of the ‘fake news’ movement. ... My work is about celebrities and public figures in private, things we have all imagined but never seen before. We think we know them intimately but we only know them through the media imagery -- very few of us have met them for real. Celebrities and public figures are created by the media industries.""",0,Political Insider
"""California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts."" Internet posts claiming that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is facing corruption charges neglects to tell readers the incident is seven years old and that the charges were dropped.
""California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts,"" read the headline on an Oct. 6, 2017, post on NewsOfTrump.com . The headline added a hallmark of fake news sites looking to engage an audience, asking readers, ""Do you support this?""
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The same subject came up on other websites , as well .
The NewsOfTrump.com post didn’t mention the charges in the headline, but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 ""meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank — where her husband was a notable shareholder.""
The post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions.
""As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks,"" the post read. ""Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.""
These posts describe real events, when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock.
But the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010 .
Reports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million .)
In August 2010, the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad. Her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, also was charged.
But the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges, making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting.
They also don’t mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012 .
In contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee, a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks, and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group.
Moore was given a letter of reproval for the incident , for not stopping Waters’ involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help.
Waters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors, who typically zero in on political flashpoints. She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to ""take Trump out"" and called him ""the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president.""
Although based on things that really happened, the fake news posts distort the timeline and leave out the final result of the House ethics committee investigation. Someone reading it would be misinformed of the events.",0,Bloggers
"Says John Bolton supported the Iraq War and said last year that ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct."" It's speculated that one of Donald Trump’s potential nominees for secretary of state is former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton received some hostile fire this week from a senator on his own side of the aisle.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blasted Bolton in a column on the media platform rare.us : ""Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.""
Paul is a libertarian who has often expressed skepticism about the United States launching wars overseas. Bolton is a staunch hawk who served as part of the national security brain trust of then-President George W. Bush during the launch of the Iraq War.
In his column, Paul said Bolton was ""one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. ‘I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,’ Bolton said just last year.""
In recent years, many Americans have turned against the war -- 51 percent in Gallup’s most recent poll , taken in June 2015 said it was a mistake, and Trump himself repeatedly argued that he was against the war. ( He actually wasn’t , we and other fact-checkers found.)
So has Bolton really remained steadfast about the wisdom of the decision to go after Saddam Hussein? Apparently, the answer is yes.
We did not hear back from either Bolton’s office or from Paul’s office. However, Paul’s column included a link to his evidence.
Paul pointed to a Talking Points Memo article, which in turn referenced an article in the Washington Examiner .
In the Examiner article, published on May 14, 2015, senior congressional correspondent David Drucker quoted Bolton saying, ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct. I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, ‘Oh, things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam,’ miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone.""
This supports Paul’s assertion.
Before drawing a final conclusion, we looked at two additional questions.
First, did Bolton complain after the fact that the article misquoted him? We asked Drucker, who said, ""No, they never complained -- him or his people.""
And second, has Bolton said anything else since then that would make his comment in the Examiner interview outdated? The answer here seems to be no, as well. We searched in both Google and Nexis and found no contrary comments by Bolton in the subsequent year and a half.
The only relevant quote we found in our searches was published on the same day as the Examiner article. It was a blog post in the Washington Post that quoted Bolton saying, ""My answer would have been: 'If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region.' ""
This only supports the gist of what Paul said.",1,Rand Paul
"Says ""Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resigning from the post of associate justice of the Supreme Court."" Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made it no secret last summer that she is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump. But contrary to what a popular fake news story says, she has not announced she’s retiring.
Bloggers on multiple websites have posted an article with the headline, ""Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resigning from the post of associate justice of the Supreme Court."" The most recent one we saw was on Jan. 2, 2017 , but recently there are plenty of other examples going back to December 2016 .
The posts draw on speculation that Trump will have the opportunity to nominate replacements for several Supreme Court justices as they retire over the next four years. Trump already is preparing to nominate a successor for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, after Republicans in Congress for months refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland.
At 83, Ginsburg is considered to be one of the justices Trump might replace, should Ginsburg retire or die while he is in office. Fueling that talk is Ginsburg’s outspoken opposition to Trump.
All the fake posts read essentially the same, allegedly quoting Ginsburg in an interview about what would happen if Trump started choosing replacement Supreme Court justices.
""I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,"" Ginsburg told the Associated Press, according to the posts.
Ginsburg really did say those words, but in a different context: She told the AP she couldn’t imagine Trump becoming president in an interview on July 7, 2016 , and didn’t want to consider the prospect.
It was one of several comments over the span of a week in which Ginsburg expressed a low opinion of Trump, calling him a ""faker"" and that she ""can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.""
That netted Ginsburg plenty of criticism before she said a week later she regretted making the ""ill-advised"" and ""incautious"" remarks .
While Ginsburg did express distaste for Trump publicly, everything else in the fake news posts appear to be completely contrived.
The posts all include lengthy faux quotes in which Ginsburg says she could not tolerate Trump as a president and would resign should he become commander in chief. Tellingly, even the posts after the Nov. 8 election refer to Trump as a candidate instead of the president-elect.
That’s because the posts draw from a fake story posted July 8 on a website called TheRightists.com. The site says on its ""about us"" description page that ""This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!""
In the fake story, Ginsburg announces she will resign if Trump becomes president. In real life, she said five weeks before Trump was elected that she had no intention of retiring .
TheRightists.com, which is registered to an address in Israel , is part of a family of websites that take a kernel of real news and then construct a fake story around it. Related sites like Politicono.com and Newslo.com include a button so that readers can identify what is fabricated, but TheRightists.com does not. That makes it very difficult to tell that most of the quoted material is completely made up.
We attempted to contact some of the sites that reposted the article to see if they knew it was fake, but did not receive any responses.
Clearly many readers in the comments sections of these websites are unaware the story is fabricated. Adding a real, out-of-context quote from Ginsburg with no disclaimer that the story is fake only confuses matters more.",0,Bloggers
"""Democrats announce they will abolish ICE if they win 2020 election."" Have Democrats announced plans to abolish one of the nation’s immigration enforcement agencies if they win the 2020 presidential election?
That’s the headline of a March 11 story on yournewswire.com, but the text of the story did not support that claim, offering only calls from editorial writers and no presidential politicians as evidence.
Some left-leaning media outlets, immigrant rights advocates and a former spokesman for the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign have suggested ending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but that’s different from claiming it will be part of a candidate’s platform.
Here’s more to the story and it’s misleading headline.
""Senior Democrats have announced plans to completely abolish ICE if a Democratic candidate wins the presidential election in 2020,"" said the March 11 post . ""According to sources within the DNC, the abolition of the nation’s immigration enforcement agency looks likely to become a primary campaign issue in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary.""
No sources were named. We reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not get a response.
The story includes a few sentences contradicting its overarching claim.
It said that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was asked on MSNBC if ICE should exist, and that her answer — ""certainly"" —  ""sparked a backlash among some liberals."" (In the interview, Harris said undocumented immigrants should be deported if they commit serious and violent offenses. ""ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role. ICE should exist."")
Political pundits have speculated that Harris might run for president in 2020. But her stance of keeping ICE goes against yournewswire.com’s claim that Democrats announced they will abolish ICE if they win the 2020 election.
The story does include legitimate examples of others calling for an end to ICE, including statements from Brian Fallon, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman, and posts published by some media organizations.
Fallon on Jan. 21, 2018 tweeted that Democratic candidates in 2020 ""should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.""
Jack Mirkinson, a news editor for the website Splinter, took it further in a story responding to Harris’ MSNBC interview, writing , ""ICE must be abolished. Anything less is not good enough.""
The Nation published a piece on March 9 from researcher and writer Sean McElwee headlined, ""It’s Time to Abolish ICE."" Yournewswire.com notes that The Nation’s piece quotes Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project, which describes itself as working to ""to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive leaders, and realize bold progressive policies.""
Yournewswire.com included a tweet by MSNBC host Chris Hayes that linked to McElwee’s article and wrote, ""This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it.""
The Nation’s story mentions several Democrats running for Congress and for state offices who support defunding ICE. But it does not cite Democrats with plans to run for president in 2020 calling for ICE’s abolition.
While there are calls from some Democrats running for state offices and Congress to defund ICE, yournewswire.com’s post offers no evidence of presidential hopefuls making such claims. It actually cites one possible presidential contender, Harris from California, as saying ICE should exist.",0,Bloggers
"""I'm the only governor in America ... who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody."" Less than two weeks after tying President Barack Obama to the killing of police officers , Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker defended his own approach to defusing tensions between law enforcement and the communities they patrol.
In an interview on CNN’s  State of the Union  on Sept. 13, 2015, host Jake Tapper asked Walker to explain why he thought Obama played a role in the recent violence against police. Walker said the president hasn’t spoken out enough on the issue, and that police should be both supported and held accountable.
""I’m proud to say I'm the only governor in America, the first one and I believe the only one today, who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody.""
The August 2014 police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., sparked calls for just such independent inquiries. We wanted to see if Walker in fact is the only governor to have approved a statewide law.
According to a few legal experts, plus our review of state-level legislation, Walker is on solid ground.
The Wisconsin law
On April 23, 2014, months before the Brown shooting, Walker signed Act 348 .  The law enjoyed bipartisan support. It required that whenever an officer on or off-duty kills someone, there will be an investigation by at least two investigators, ""neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.""
Once the investigation is complete, the report goes to the district attorney in the county where the death took place for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the report is made public.
Michael Scott is the director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and clinical professor in criminology at Arizona State University. Scott told us that analysts for the Wisconsin Legislature in 2014 found no other state required an independent investigation for police-related deaths. Scott said this measure came after a 10-year effort by one family.
""The push for this legislation in Wisconsin came from a coalition organized by Mr. Michael Bell, the father of a young man shot and killed by police in Wisconsin,"" Scott said. ""Two state legislators, Sen. Gary Bies and Rep. Chris Taylor, took up his cause and sponsored the legislation that Gov. Walker signed. Gov. Walker can take credit for signing the legislation, but it was not proposed by his office.""
We found legislators in several states, including Connecticut , California , New York and Missouri , introduced similar measures in 2015, but so far, none have passed.
We also learned from the Walker campaign that many local police departments in Wisconsin and around the country already require an independent investigation. However, those policies are not state law.
A funding wrinkle
There was a brief flap in Wisconsin over the money to pay for these inquiries. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported that Walker’s initial 2015 budget provided no funds. But after the attorney general, a Republican, told House budget writers that this was not a cheap endeavor, and a state report showed the state’s Justice Department had investigated 12 deaths in less than a year since the law took effect, lawmakers agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested.
Walker’s office agreed, and the governor signed a two-year budget that included $635,000 for the work.",1,Scott Walker
"""Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia."" A fake Russian troll account suspended months ago is the subject of a fake news headline about House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and a sexual abuse scandal.
""Tennessee GOP Twitter taken down, after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia,"" stated the Nov. 26 headline on Puppet String News , a fake news website .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The article showed an alleged tweet by @TEN_GOP:
""I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout. #draintheswamp #Shushfund."" (We assume that ""take"" is a typo and was supposed to say ""talk."")
We searched news accounts and found nothing about Pelosi authorizing such a payout. The tweet appears to be the only source of the information.
According to RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence, @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account. It had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was shut down in August 2017, two years after it launched. The fake account had nearly 150,000 followers -- far more than the real state party’s twitter account of about 13,000.
The real Tennessee Republican Party contacted Twitter multiple times to report that @TEN_GOP was impersonating the party’s actual account.
""It was very misleading, pretending to be our office,"" Tennessee Republican Party communications director Candice Dawkins told PolitiFact
Twitter’s press office didn’t respond to an email from PolitiFact.
Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.''
The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.
Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians .
The headline on Puppet String News states, ""Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia.""
Actually, Twitter took down the fake Russian news account in August, and we found no evidence that Pelosi was involved in a payout related to pedophilia.
The Puppet String News’ website states that it was created by a U.S. Navy veteran who ""decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability."" We attempted to contact the website via a Facebook message and did not get a reply.",0,PuppetStringNews.com
"""Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died."" A fake news story that claimed former President Barack Obama tweeted that he wanted U.S. Sen. John McCain to die from a brain tumor originally came from a parody website looking to troll conservatives.
The headline on a July 20, 2017, post on DailyThings.world read, ""Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died."" Facebook users flagged the story here and on NewsFeedHunter.com as being potentially fabricated, in an effort to cut down on fake news.
The story included an image of a July 19 tweet from Obama that read, ""John McCain is NOT a war hero. If there were any God in heaven, he would have died from that brain tumor."" The post said Obama quickly deleted the tweet.
The story came on the heels of the announcement that McCain, R-Ariz., was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a primary glioblastoma. The American Brain Tumor Association said that a 2009 study showed almost 10 percent of patients may potentially live five years or longer. The 80-year-old is considering treatment options.
McCain returned to the U.S. Senate for votes on Republican health care reform, most recently casting a deciding vote against a last-ditch ""skinny repeal"" bill to end the Affordable Care Act.
But let’s be clear: This story is completely fake.
There was no such tweet for Obama to delete. It was no doubt the product of any number of websites that allow you to create a fake tweet that appears to come from another account .
The only thing Obama tweeted on July 19 were words of encouragement for McCain, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 presidential election.
""John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John,"" Obama wrote.
There is no record of another tweet from Obama’s account that day.
The fake story originated the same day on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody website with hidden registration information . It appears to be affiliated with a network of websites run by liberal trolls who run fake news sites in an attempt to fool conservatives.

"Democrats ""booed families of children murdered by MS13."" A bogus story on Facebook claims that Democrats booed during the recent State of the Union address when President Donald Trump addressed introduced the families of teenagers who were killed by MS-13 gang members on Long Island.
Democrats ""booed families of children murdered by MS13,"" said a Jan. 30 headline by CSC Mediagroup.USA .
""This just goes to show that Democrats would rather support illegals who cause harm to Americans rather than support actual American citizens. What does this say about them? They’re DemocRATS.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that video of Trump’s speech showed a bipartisan chamber stood up and applauded the victims’ parents.
Trump invited the parents of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, two teenage girls from Long Island, to listen to his speech. The girls were murdered in September 2016 while walking together in their hometown. Members of the MS-13 gang have been charged with their murders, including some who were illegal immigrants.
We listened to and watched videos of Trump’s speech to examine the chamber’s reaction.
Just before he introduced the girls’ parents, Trump made a statement about illegal immigrants that drew an audible hiss from some members. (Listen around minute 43:30)
""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.""
But then when Trump spoke to the girls’ parents, the chamber sounded silent.
Speaking to the girls’ parents, Trump said: ""Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand,"" he said, as the parents then stood. ""Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.""
The videos show that members stood up and applauded the girls’ parents.
Some Democrats did boo and hiss a separate part of Trump’s speech about immigration when he called for an end to ""chain migration.""
""Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,"" Trump said.
Many Democrats brought to the speech as their guests Dreamers, people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The future fate of Dreamers is up in the air following Trump’s decision announced last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
CSC Mediagroup.USA’s disclaimer proclaims that it isn’t fake news and that it publishes news from a conservative perspective that the mainstream media ignores.
However, in this case it’s headline is wrong. We found no evidence that Democrats ""booed families of children murdered by MS13"" -- instead they booed other comments Trump made about chain migration.",0,CSC Mediagroup.USA
"""Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW"" Conservative websites are firing back about the women who accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of dating teenagers when he was an adult.
The Washington Post broke a story that four women said Moore pursued them when they were teenage girls and he was in his 30s. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, is running in a Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones.
The Last Line of Defense website says in a Nov. 11 headline, ""Second Roy Moore Accuser works for Michelle Obama right now."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The article states that ""Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore ‘groped her in the alley behind the’ church they both attended in 1957.
The article then uses an alleged quote by Dourif on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show: ""It was the most horrifying moment of my life,"" she said. Dourif was not a guest on Rachel Maddow and never gave that quote.
The website also falsely states that Dourif is employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at a Washington mansion.
""This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that ‘Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif,' "" states The Last Line of Defense.
We searched the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, and found no mention of Dourif.
There are several signs that the The Last Line of Defense article is fake news. First, Fiona Dourif is an actress born in 1981, so it would have been impossible for someone to molest her decades earlier. (Dourif played the role of Nica Pierce in the horror movies Cult of Chucky and Curse of Chucky.)
Secondly, Moore would have been 10 years old in 1957.
Third, a disclaimer on the Last Line of Defense’s website states:
""America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.

"Say Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison. A fake news item claims Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was sexually and physically assaulted by a prison inmate.
The article — with the headline ""Dylann Roof, killer of 14 Charleston church members raped and beaten by inmate"" — quotes the Charleston County sheriff describing the assault in detail.
""According to Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, the assault happened shortly before 8 a.m. as Roof was being escorted to the showers in Housing Unit 1B,"" the article states.
But among the many problems with this item: Roof is no longer housed in Charleston.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator shows that Roof is imprisoned in a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He was transferred there in April 2017 following his federal death sentence, according to news reports .
Other issues abound in this fake item. The fake post purports to link a to a video — but no such video exists on the site. The headline also misstates the number of victims. (Roof killed nine parishioners, not 14.)
A similar fake news item was debunked by our friends at Snopes in 2016. Snopes reported that the phony conspiracy theory about Roof being raped in prison originated in July 2015 on the fake news website NYMeta, and has continued in various forms and outlets since then.
There are a couple possible reasons why this hoax persists.
For starters, the idea of retribution against Roof may appeal to readers’ desire for justice for one of the deadliest hate crimes in U.S. history.
The story’s staying power may also have something to do with the fact it shares some similarities to an actual news story, albeit one with important differences.
In August 2016, Roof was reportedly beaten while being held at the Charleston County jail. The assault ""left Roof with minor bruises,"" but there is no evidence that the mass shooter was the victim of sexual assault.
The fake news item also claims Roof was assaulted while being escorted to the shower unit. However, the assault against him in August 2016 occurred after an unlocked cell door allowed an inmate to approach Roof.",0,Bloggers
"Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons The publication of former interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile’s book has revived conspiracy theories about the 2016 shooting death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.

Weeks later, Rich’s death became intertwined with WikiLeaks after it released hacked emails from the DNC. WikiLeaks head Julian Assange suggested in a Dutch television interview that Rich might have been murdered.
In ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,"" Brazile wrote about the grief and fears she felt in the aftermath of Rich’s murder, even closing the blinds in her office so a sniper couldn’t see her.
Brazile wrote that she felt some responsibility for Rich’s death.
""I didn’t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights,"" she wrote.
She speculated about the motivation behind his shooting but wrote that police believed he was a victim of a robbery.

"Says ""Carnival Cruise Lines will now offer free cruises"" to hurricane victims. A bogus online post that said Miami-based Carnival Cruise Line was providing cruises and cash to people affected by an unnamed hurricane was from a website that generates fake news articles.
""Carnival Cruise Lines will now offer FREE Cruises,"" read the headline on a Sept. 20, 2017, post on BreakingNews247.net . The post featured an image of the vessel the Carnival Sunshine .
""Carnival is now offering Free Cruises to those effected (sic) by the Hurricane,"" the post read. ""Just call Carnival or Message John Heald and say you want a stress free cruise with ( hash tag) Carnivalfamily and they will have you set up on a 4-7 night cruise of your choice. Just pay taxes and port fees. You also will receive $100 per cabin OBC.""
There’s no mention of which 2017 hurricane sparked the offer, whether it be Harvey, which drenched Texas, or Irma, which blew through Florida (the ""OBC"" stands for on-board credit).
But Carnival isn’t offering such a deal, because the story is fake.
It’s not readily apparent, but BreakingNews247.net is one of a gaggle of websites that allow users to create their own stories, labeling them as ""prank"" articles.
Below the text and some advertisements is a button that reads ""Create a Prank."" Clicking on it allows a user to build their own fake story.
PolitiFact has written about similar sites before . A range of websites allowing people to generate these kinds of stories have been reported by Facebook users for all manner of faux stories, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news.
While some people may look at the sites as a way to create jokes, they open up the potential for a scam known as ""like farming."" That’s when users create posts to gain as many likes as possible . The scammers then use highly ranked links to spread malware, gain readers’ personal information or otherwise make money.
This particular post first appeared sometime before Sept. 15 , according to the Miami Herald. It drew Carnival’s attention after being posted on Facebook.
The post suggested readers contact Heald, who is a real British Carnival cruise director . Heald addressed the hoax on his own Facebook profile , in which he engages Carnival customers.
""It is a fake page and we have reported the author accordingly,"" Heald wrote in a Sept. 15 Facebook post .
Heald said on the post that he was aware which Facebook group was spreading the fake story but didn’t elaborate. He also called the original poster a ""soulless, heartless wanker"" and further talked about the issue in a video posted to his profile later that day.
A Carnival spokeswoman confirmed that the story was false, although the company is making monetary donations and helping ferry supplies to storm-affected areas . Carnival reported the original Facebook post, which appeared to have been removed.
But the fake story was still available at BreakingNews247.net. As of this writing, a counter on the article said it had been shared more than 83,000 times.

"""White supremacist who killed protester is a Democrat and visited (President Barack) Obama in Oval Office."" A fake news story falsely claimed that white supremacist Jason Kessler was the one responsible for killing a protester in Charlottesville, Va., in addition to meeting former President Barack Obama as a Democratic supporter.
""White supremacist who killed protester is a Democrat and visited Obama in Oval Office,"" read the headline on an Aug. 15, 2017, post on PatriotUSA.website . We also saw it on other outlets .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to stamp out fake news.
The post began by claiming Kessler, who organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, had been exposed as a former liberal, Occupy Wall Street protester and Obama supporter. The post included this tweet from conservative writer Dinesh D’Souza:
That part, at least, is accurate, as D’Souza’s link to the Southern Poverty Law Center showed. Kessler has said he changed ideologies near the end of 2013 . But that’s about all in the story that’s true.
The story said Kessler was the person accused of being ""the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road."" That’s not the case.
Charlottesville police arrested James Alex Fields Jr. for driving his car into a crowd of liberal protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people.
There have been several fake news stories attempting to shift the blame for the killing or suggesting Democrats were behind the protests . This attempt to put the blame on Kessler included the assertion in the post that he visited Obama in the White House in 2016, including the crude Photoshopped image at the top of this page with the story.
That photo is actually a White House image from 2011, showing actor Will Ferrell visiting Obama in the Oval Office (Ferrell’s wife Viveca Paulin has been cropped out):
And while the story attempted to demonize liberals by drawing lines between Democrats and Nazis, the source of the story is a website that makes up its content.
The post first appeared Aug. 15 on OurLandOfTheFree.com , a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.
OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site’s creators ""make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not."" Its About Us page noted, ""All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not.""

"""Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros"" Billionaire George Soros is now officially a wanted man in Russia, a viral story would have you believe.
""Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros,"" reads a March 10 headline on Viral Politics US .
The story smashes together work by Soros groups in Russia and quotes from a Rolling Stone article that have nothing to do with Soros to create an inaccurate hoax.
While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that it issued a warrant for his arrest. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Similar hoaxes about Soros and Putin have circulated since November 2016 .
Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . He has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that President Donald Trump declared Soros a ""national security threat"" .
Viral Politics US stated that Russia declared Soros and his organizations a ""threat to Russian national security.""
That phrase is similar to the language used by Russian officials when they banned two Soros charities in 2015.
""It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state,"" stated a translated version of a press statement by Russia's General Prosecutor's Office in November 2015.
The Viral Politics US story pulls actual quotes from a 2010 Rolling Stone article about Goldman Sachs including this quote: ""The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.""
Although the Rolling Stone article makes no mention of Soros, the Viral Politics US story tries to create a connection by stating ""obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs.""
Viral Politics US then tosses in a quote by a man named Phil Butler: ""George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it,’"" Viral Politics US wrote.
The online hoax provides no explanation about the identity of Butler, but we found the quote by Butler in an article for the online magazine New Eastern Outlook in July 2016. Butler described Soros as a ""real arch villain"" and accused Soros of manipulating the 2016 presidential election. Butler describes himself as an analyst and expert on Eastern Europe.
While there is no evidence that Putin sought a warrant to arrest Soros, the billionaire has been a major critic of the Russian president and said he believes that Putin has been behind the attacks on him.
In January while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros said, ""Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin’s Russia, are on the rise.""
In October 2016, Soros criticized Putin for Russia's bombing campaign in Syria calling on him to ""put an end to his heinous crimes against humanity.""

"Says Hillary Clinton ""said she was under attack (in Bosnia) but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers."" Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump wasted no time punching back the day after Hillary Clinton listed in detail why he could not be trusted to run the economy.
Clinton ""is a world-class liar,"" Trump said in a June 22, 2016, speech in New York. ""Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.""
On that Bosnia trip, Trump picked one of Clinton’s most prominent transgressions. When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008 . Here’s why.
During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.
""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.""
But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post  Fact Checke r also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady.
CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip : ""To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. ""
Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. ""There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,"" she said.
But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she ""misspoke,"" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, ""So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.""
On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, ""We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there.""
Interestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling:
""Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' ""
There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem.",1,Donald Trump
"""U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident."" A self-described conservative blog revived a rumor from the Clinton body count archives. The blog Conservative Politicus had the stirring headline "" U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident after all ,"" on June 17.
This has the essential ingredients to meet the appetite of any conspiracy fan: Clintons, a legal case and a dead man.
That doesn’t mean those elements are on the money.
Yes, Ashe died in 2016, and yes, there was a criminal case. But no, he wasn’t going to testify against either Bill or Hillary Clinton.
Now, for the back story.
John Ashe represented Antigua and Barbuda at the United Nations and at one time served as president of the General Assembly. In October 2015, the FBI accused Ashe of receiving at least $500,000 in bribes to benefit a Chinese businessman named Ng Lap Seng.
Ng isn’t a household name today but back in 1998, a Senate report identified him as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign in the mid 1990s. Ng visited the White House 10 times.
That is the known extent of any Clinton connection.
In June 2016, the rumor-busting website Snopes asked the office of the U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York if their case involved either Clinton. A spokesman said not at all.
The complaint against Ashe makes no mention of the Clintons.
Ashe wasn’t scheduled to testify against the Clintons. He was slated for what the spokesman described to Snopes as a standard pre-trial meeting.
As for Ashe’s death, he died at home in June 2016 when a barbell crushed his throat. That happened near the time he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors. The death was ruled an accident .
Several conspiracy-minded posts emerged soon after his death. One about a month afterward included Ashe’s name with two others who allegedly died under mysterious circumstances. The one common thread was a tie to the Clintons.",0,Bloggers
"""Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna."" A news story that said a tuna fish recall came after workers at a canning company cooked a man and added him to the product is mash-up of two real stories under a fake headline.
""Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna,"" read the headline on an April 6, 2017, post on BlueLineStrong.net .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The story itself isn’t entirely made up — but it has been repurposed with a bogus headline for a few years.
The BlueLineStrong.net post is largely an excerpt from an April 28, 2015, Associated Press article.
Here’s what happened.
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office charged two men at a Bumble Bee Foods plant for violating safety regulations in the death of a fellow employee.
Jose Melena, 62, was performing maintenance inside a 35-foot-long oven at a plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 11, 2012. He was trapped and died when workers filled the oven with six tons of canned tuna and turned it up to 270 degrees to cook and sterilize the food.
Angel Rodriguez, the plant operations director; Saul Florez, the safety manager; and Bumble Bee Foods all faced three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules. Bumble Bee Foods settled the case in August 2015 for $6 million .
To be clear, no one chopped up Melena and put his remains in the meat.
A website called TheRacketReport.com posted the story excerpt on April 28, 2015 , the same day the AP story was published. It carried the headline, ""Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.""
The story doesn’t mention anyone being mixed in with the fish, despite the headline. The site’s About Us link noted that ""the articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways.""
Fast forward to the following year.
On March 16, 2016, Bumble Bee Foods did issue a real recall for ""process deviations,"" and not for the incident related Melena.
Fake news site News4KTLA.com recycled the AP story about the workers being charged in Melena’s death the next day . The post also re-used the fake headline ""Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.""

"""When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now."" In fending off attacks on her as someone who equivocates, Hillary Clinton singled out John Edwards for changing his mind on health care.
""When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now,"" she said.
Clinton is correct. In 2004, when he was running for president, Edwards favored universal coverage for children but stopped short of proposing universal coverage for adults. At the time, he was concerned that true universal coverage would be too costly. ""What we ought to be doing is something that No. 1 is achievable and No. 2 is responsible,"" he said at a debate in Manchester, N.H., on July 28, 2003.
Edwards released a health care plan in February 2007 that mandates universal coverage. At a debate a few months later, moderator Tim Russert charged Edwards with changing his position.
""That's true and so has America,"" Edwards responded. ""I proposed universal health care for children at that point, and what is clear from this presidential campaign is I was the first presidential candidate — others have followed me now, and that's a good thing, good thing for America — but I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan. And the one thing I can
tell you ... anybody who knows me knows I will never give up.""
Edwards did release his plan before Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but Dennis Kucinich released a proposal for universal health care before Edwards.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash."" The Clinton Foundation, established by former President Bill Clinton , has long been a favorite subject for sites looking to spread questionable news on the Internet.
Here’s the latest example making the rounds. It was flagged as possibly providing false information, as part of Facebook’s effort to combat fake news.
A website called NRTONLINE posted an article on April 14, 2018, headlined, ""BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash."" Here are the opening paragraphs:
The Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they’re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6.
The warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time.
The problem: None of this ever happened.
The article was lifted wholesale from the website Reagan Was Right, which -- before the site was taken down earlier this year -- described itself as a ""whimsical playland of conservative satire."" Another disclaimer read: ""Everything on this website is fiction.""
You can’t find the Reagan Was Right article on its original web page any more, but a version of the article dated Nov. 10, 2017, is available on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.
Reagan Was Right was affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man we’ve written about previously . Blair told us his websites are a carefully curated social experiment designed to ""feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.""
Among the dubious elements of both the original Reagan Was Right article and the NRTONLINE facsimile is a reference to the nonexistent country of Latkavia, as well as a stray reference to a correspondent for ""LLOD."" The article doesn’t explain the acronym, but fake news cognoscenti will recognize it as one of Blair’s other fake (and now shuttered) sites, the Last Line of Defense.
Meanwhile, the photograph that accompanies the post was published in June 2017 by the Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom to illustrate an entirely different article -- one about police evicting a group of trailer-home residents who had seized a warehouse for 24 hours.
As for the publisher of the most recent version, NRTONLINE, a quick click into the site’s "" About Us "" page shows not an explanation of the site’s background but rather an un-filled-in web page template. So, unlike the Reagan Was Right version, NRTONLINE offered no indication that this article was ""satire.""
The Clinton Foundation confirmed to PolitiFact that the article is ""totally false.""
""We don’t rent a warehouse in the U.K., the quote from ‘Chelsea Clinton’s assistant’ is made up, and nothing in this story seems to be based in reality,"" spokesman Brian Cookstra told PolitiFact.
Fake Clinton Foundation raids are a staple of dubious web posts. For instance, in May 2017, some of our fellow fact-checkers debunked an Internet claim that a Clinton Foundation cargo ship had been caught smuggling people from Syria, drugs and illegal fruit.
The source of that claim? The Last Line of Defense.

"""Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on ‘SNL’."" A fake news story that said country singer Jason Aldean had a concert canceled after making an anti-gun statement following his Saturday Night Live performance is the work of a website that appears to be part of a troll network.
""Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on SNL,"" read the Oct. 8, 2017, headline on AsAmericanAsApplePie.org.
Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news stories. At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users.
Aldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more . He appeared for a musical performance on Saturday Night Live on Oct. 7, singing I Won’t Back Down, which also served as a tribute to Tom Petty, who died Oct. 2 .
The AsAmericanAsApplePie.org post, however, mixed some real details with some entirely fictional ones. It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say ""people should not own more than one gun,"" and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that.
It then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, ""So I want to say to them, ‘We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.’ But you can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it’s unbreakable.""
You can watch the real statement and performance here:
The post snaps back into fake events by saying Aldean ""took a knee"" as the band played part of the national anthem, and told people ""not to cave to the NRA’s terroristic agenda"" and ""always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it.""
None of those things happened, but the article said it spurred a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag and led to the cancellation of Aldean’s concert in Birmingham, Ala.
Aldean’s Birmingham show was Aug. 10 .
There is a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag , but it’s difficult to tell if it stems from this fake story, which has fooled many people on Twitter, of Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White’s condemnation of Aldean for choosing to perform on SNL over UFC 216 in Las Vegas the same night .
Aldean did cancel three California shows after the shooting ""out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans,"" but returned to Las Vegas on Oct. 8 to visit with shooting survivors .
AsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.

"Says two of U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs. A series of fake news posts appearing across several websites said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don’t even bother to consistently use the same fake names.
The bogus saga of the House minority leader’s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The posts all invoked Pelosi’s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat’s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine.
But the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days.
At first the women were said to be caught in Berkeley, Calif. , with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were apprehended at the Mexican border . The yarn went on and on, across several posts.
The gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and agreed to turn on their mother after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It’s never really specified how.)
Eventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the cabin in which they were staying burned down. They turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y. , however, so all was well.
Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam , but the stories appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com , FreedomCrossroads.us or TheLastLineOfDefense.org , a site run by Christopher Blair . He writes absurd stories about Democrats with the goal of tricking conservative readers into believing they (and his website) are real.
OurLandOfTheFree.com said it ""makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality."" FreedomCrossroads.us has an About Us page that claims the site ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth.""
The posts don’t align very well, with details varying from story to story, such as the women’s ages or even names, which change constantly.
Sometimes the pair are called Heather and Nicole . Or maybe Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn . Or Jillian and Veronica . Or Amber and Carly . Or Louanne and Marissa .
For the record, Pelosi’s five children are daughters Christine, Alexandra, Jacqueline and Nancy, and one son named Paul.
At least a couple of images used on posts were actually of two women arrested for smuggling drugs. But those photos were of a pair of Scots arrested in Peru for trying to sneak cocaine to Spain in 2013.
The grand finale is a July 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org under the headline, ""Liberal troll paid $100K for Nancy Pelosi drug bust hoax.""
The post said George Soros paid the author to fool people for his own amusement, but that ""in the end, everyone knows Pelosi is guilty and (Hillary) Clinton is behind everything.""

"""Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course."" A story twisted the words of a California lawmaker who called for banning possession of semiautomatic assault weapons to falsely state that Democrats want to seize all guns.
""Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course,"" stated a May 7 headline on RevolutionRadio.org, which copied the story and headline by NaturalNews.com .
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here . The headline blows out of proportion statements by U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, who represents the San Francisco Bay area.

Swalwell, a former prosecutor, wrote a  USA Today  op-ed calling for the United States to get rid of assault weapons. He wrote about the deadly outcomes of being fired at by such a weapon.
""Trauma surgeons and coroners will tell you the high-velocity bullet fired from a military-style, semiautomatic assault weapon moves almost three times as fast as a 9mm handgun bullet, delivering far more energy. The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading.""
Swalwell said that reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would still leave millions of assault weapons on the streets.
""Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons,"" he wrote. ""The ban would not apply to law enforcement agencies or shooting clubs.""
The NaturalNews story said that Swalwell ""actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.""
We saw no evidence in Swalwell’s op-ed that he wants law enforcement to use such a tactic. We asked his spokeswoman how he would envision law enforcement obtaining such assault weapons.
""The Congressman supports an assault weapon buy-back period, and then limiting any weapons not sold back to licensed clubs and ranges, with a ban on possession anywhere else,"" Caitlyn McNamee said in an email. ""He has never proposed and does not support door-to-door searches, which would be unworkable, unsafe, and – without a warrant – unconstitutional. But anyone found to be in possession of such a weapon after the buyback period has elapsed would be in violation of the law to possess and subject to prosecution.""
On his congressional website , Swalwell doesn’t propose any sort of widespread gun confiscation. While calling for more gun control measures, including improving background checks and an assault weapons ban, he has also stated support for the Second Amendment.
""I am the son and brother of hunters and gun owners,"" he wrote. I know that guns can be used responsibly and the Second Amendment provides individuals certain rights to own firearms.""
A headline said that ""Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course."" The story that followed wasn’t broadly about Democrats, but rather about one Democrat: U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell.

""Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition after head on collision driving home,"" read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com , a known fake news site . Other suspect sites also ran the story.
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on bogus news in users’ feeds.
The fake story said that Carlson was driving home from Tucker Carlson Tonight in New York when he ""was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.""
The post claimed Carlson was taken to a hospital for surgery, while the driver of a Ford Explorer with a reinforced bumper and extra foam padding on the steering wheel fled the scene after hitting the news anchor.
That article was followed the next day by another on DailyUsaUpdate.com that said Carlson had died from his injuries, and that police had ruled the death a homicide.
The story strongly suggested the crash was deliberate, and had something to do with either the Clinton Foundation, former FBI director James Comey’s firing, or both. This follow-up, too, ended up on other websites .
First of all, we know the story is fake, because Carlson is alive. A Fox News Channel spokeswoman confirmed to us that the articles are a hoax. She also noted that Carlson is based in Washington, not New York.
The post is yet another fake news story created by the parody purveyor TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts.
The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.
The original fake post that Carlson had been in a crash appeared on the site on May 13 , and its follow-up was published May 14 .
Then TheLastLineOfDefense.org published another story on May 14 that said the death rumors were actually a hoax perpetrated by someone who goes by the name Busta Troll . He had been paid more than $100,000 by billionaire George Soros to make up the story, the post said.
While the update is written to make it sound as if TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled into thinking Carlson had died because of Busta Troll, the real story is that Wilekenmeyer (or whatever his true name may be) actually is Busta Troll .
The troll character is part of a years-long saga involving the author "" goating "" conservative web pages and using pseudonyms to spread contrived stories aimed at fooling conservative readers. A complex scheme to expose the identity of Busta Troll in 2014 turned out to be yet another trolling scenario.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org had followed a similar strategy in April 2017 when saying that conservative rocker Ted Nugent had first been killed in a hunting accident, then had been assassinated, then had actually faked his own death.
Nugent was still alive, and so is Carlson.",0,Bloggers
"""Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don’t Dump Trump."" Online reports said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would switch parties unless the GOP stops supporting President Donald Trump.
The headlines are wrong, even though the stories use real quotes from Graham.
""Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don’t Dump Trump,"" read the headline from a March 21, 2017, post from TrueTrumpers.com . Facebook users reported the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news.
The headline is certainly made up, because there’s no evidence Graham has considered trading in his elephant for a donkey. The story, meanwhile, does use real quotes in which Graham disagreed with Trump — albeit before the real estate billionaire was president.
We can tell this is an old article, because TrueTrumpers.com’s post called Trump the ""the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee."" The bulk of the story concerns Trump’s attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump University.
Trump had said in June 2016 that Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" because of his ""Mexican heritage,"" saying Curiel was biased against Trump over his calls to build a wall on the border with Mexico.
Curiel shrugged off the comments , and approved a $25 million settlement in the case. The judge has recently been assigned a case brought by a young man deported in February 2017 , despite being protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The TrueTrumpers.com post said Graham told the New York Times that Trump’s comments were ""the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy. If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it.""
Graham did say this, in a June 6, 2016 story in the New York Times.
The post also uses another real quote from Graham, who told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson the following day :
""There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me. But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.""
There are also quotes from Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine (although the post referred to Collins as a representative instead of a senator).
The TrueTrumpers.com story largely copied a June 7, 2016, article on the Huffington Post, and has appeared on other websites prior to this March 21 post.
A June 9 post on WeAreChange.org had the same story, but with a slightly different headline that read, ""Lindsey Graham will become a Democrat if Republicans select Trump,"" reflecting that Trump had not yet been officially nominated. The first couple of paragraphs were altered from the Huffington Post article.
By March 20, 2017, a post on Spinzon.com had the same headline as the TrueTrumpers.com post.
It’s apparent that a radical headline was slapped on the story to drive traffic. Graham did not say he was planning on changing his party affiliation, but he did disagree with Trump’s comments about a federal judge.
While the story itself is accurate (albeit with little context), the headline is not.",0,Bloggers
"""We now do have evidence"" that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Hillary Clinton took flak from fact-checkers back in December when she claimed that Donald Trump’s comments were being used as a recruiting tool by ISIS.
We rated that statement False , for lack of evidence. The Washington Post Fact Checker said a link did not "" appear to exist .""
Fast-forward five months. Clinton says those links now do exist.
""When you say we're going to bar all Muslims, you are sending a message to the Muslim world and you're also sending a message to the terrorists because we now do have evidence,"" Clinton said May 19 on CNN. ""We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism.""
So, has something changed?
Indeed, yes.
Not long after Clinton’s initial comments, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, released a 51-minute video telling ""Muslims of the West"" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. Ten minutes into the video, it says the United States has a history of ""slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps.""
It then cuts to Trump calling for a temporary but ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S,"" according to SITE Intelligence Group, which studies jihadist propaganda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal . It urges American Muslims to leave the United States and join the group.
Later, on March 24, Newsweek reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip from Trump.
""Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show,"" Trump says in the video , as ISIS lets the phrase ""absolute horror show"" repeatedly echo and fade.
Clinton's initial statement in December ""was false at the time,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""It’s true now.""
Trump's comment in the Brussels video may not seem inflammatory, he said, yet ""if you game it out from the perspective of, say, ISIS and they think Donald Trump is a great recruiting tool, then probably they don't want to play him up too much before the election because they'd want him to win.""
There may be other videos, Gartenstein-Ross said. ""Unlike in the past when you had multiple analysts watch every al-Qaida release, ISIS's video production operation is so large, it's really hard for people to watch every single ISIS release because they release so much. They're extraordinarily prolific. I would wager there are other uses of him in their propaganda.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says ""Meryl Streep just got fired from a major project for lying about Trump."" Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep’s harsh political words during a speech at the Golden Globes made her a target for fake news purveyors, who are falsely claiming she lost a movie deal for complaining about Donald Trump.
""Meryl Streep just got fired from a major project for lying about Trump,"" read the headline on posts on multiple sites starting Jan. 9, 2017. The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information.
This one, keyed off Streep’s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8 , is as fictional as any Hollywood creation.
Streep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump’s policies and past actions in her speech , without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim Trump has falsely denied .
Trump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her ""over-rated"" and a ""Hillary flunky,"" again denying he mocked a reporter.
The fake blog posts claim Streep’s speech was enough for Ron Howard to kick her off a reboot of the TV show Happy Days. That’s odd on its own, because Howard took to Twitter himself to chide Trump and defend Streep’s freedom of speech.
The article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham. Plenty of passages in the fake story — such as saying Streep ""hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes"" — hint that this is an attempt at humor.
The story appears to have first appeared on a Jan. 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that describes itself as being opposed to President Barack Obama and ""whiny politically correct liberal masses."" We therefore don’t suspect they were fans of Florence Foster Jenkins.
The ""About Us"" portion of their site reads , ""All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" But this disclaimer isn’t obvious on the story itself, and certainly isn’t apparent reading other websites to which the post was shared.
For fans of the Fonz, we must also note that the suggestion of a Happy Days reboot (with or without Streep) also appears fake. There has been no verified report of any kind of reboot of Happy Days. RadioTimes.com wrote last year that series creator Garry Marshall said the show may one day be revived by Paramount , but there’s little to suggest that’s been greenlit.
The only other mention of a new Happy Days series was a story that said Netflix was creating one , but that post, too, came from a fake news website trying to be funny.",0,Bloggers
"Says Melania Trump hired exorcist to ""cleanse White House of Obama demons."" Story that Melania Trump hired an exorcist to remove Obama’s demons from the White House is a hoax
A hoax circulating on Facebook claims that first lady Melania Trump hired a professional exorcist to cleanse the White House of past demons from the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton years.
""Melania Trump hired exorcist to ‘cleanse White House of Obama demons,"" read the headline on February 8 from Your News Wire .
The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat fake news.
Stephanie Grisham , a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, says any reports claiming the first lady had a ceremony to rid the White House of demons before moving in is false and ""not true in any way.""
Your News Wire report originally appeared on Right Wing Watch , a blog dedicated to exposing the activities and rhetoric of extreme right-wing voices. A series of other websites reported variations of Trump’s supposed efforts to rid the White House of demons.
The story opens by quoting Pastor Paul Begley of West Lafayette, Ind., saying Trump told him that she would not go into the White House unless it had been completely exorcised. However, there’s no record that the two ever personally corresponded, and in the podcast where Begley is speaking about this, he claims that is what Trump had told her husband, President Donald Trump.
The White House is now ""free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography"" according to the article.
Begley is quoted as saying that President Donald Trump allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House seven times, anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him. But, the only known occurrence of Trump inviting evangelical leaders to the White House happened last July with invitations to about 30 leaders .
While some evangelicals did lay their hands on Trump out of a religious respect that can be shown as a sign of responsibility, there is no reports that he was anointed with oil. Also, this occasion was only publicly reported to have occurred once, not seven times.
Begley also claims that apparently during Obama’s presidency and possibly presidents before him, ""there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic."" There is no record proving that any previous presidents engaged in demonology or paganism.
The story also says that former President Bill Clinton confessed in his memoir My Life that he and his wife Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where a ""spirit arrived"" possessing participants to walk on hot coals and burn their flesh with fire and one person to bite the head off a living chicken.
Clinton did write about attending a voodoo practice in a Haitian village, but they were not the hosts. The Clintons and their now-deceased friend and former Citibank executive David Edwards , who bought the trip as a wedding gift to the Clintons, were given a ""brief course in voodoo theology.""
Clinton wrote: ""After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground.""
The passage about the ceremony in My Life make it clear that the Clintons’ attendance of the voodoo session was observational.",0,YourNewsWire.com
"""Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers"" One conspiratorial news website recycled a years-old Senate report in an effort to link former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to negligence by the Department of Health and Human Services between 2013 and 2015 that led to the abuse of migrant children.
""Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers,"" read a June 17, 2018, headline from Your News Wire, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online.
The Your News Wire story cited 2016 articles from The New York Times and  New York magazine , as well as a Jan. 28, 2016, Senate report based on an inquiry into the role of HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement in protecting unaccompanied migrant children from human trafficking and other abuses.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
The story said: ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an ‘unknown number’ of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,’ according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.""
This statement is wrong or misleading in several ways — starting with its attempt to frame a Senate report from 2016 as a new and shocking release that the media ignored. Casual readers could have thought the Your News Wire story related to the recent FBI Inspector General’s report, which concerned Clinton’s use of personal emails and was released Thursday, June 14, 2018.
In reality, the Senate’s findings were widely reported in 2016, and the many contemporary news stories — including an Associated Press investigation that overlapped with the Senate report — made our fact-checking job easy.
The Senate report said that HHS placed more than a dozen migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor.
The report did not say anything about Clinton playing a role in that process.
Both the Senate report and AP investigation discovered that HHS, which is responsible for finding adult sponsors to temporarily house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings, neglected to comply with federal law requiring that the children be protected from human trafficking and other forms of abuse.
As unaccompanied children surged across the southern border toward the beginning of the decade, the department slashed several safety standards in order to quickly transfer the new arrivals from government shelters to sponsors’ homes.
Caseworkers who had previously followed strict guidelines for placing children with sponsors — guidelines that required background checks, fingerprints, home studies and signed agreements to bring the children to immigration court — were instructed by agency officials in November 2013 to stop fingerprinting. Shortly after that, they were also instructed to stop requesting original copies of birth certificates, seeking personal and identifying information, or checking criminal history.
The hastened process saw several children placed in households with sponsors who forced them into labor or otherwise abused them, according to the Senate and AP reports. It is unknown exactly how many of the approximately 90,000 migrant children placed into sponsor custody between 2013 and 2015 experienced trafficking or other abuse.
But neither report mentioned Clinton or used the term ""gift"" in reference to the placement of children with human traffickers.
We could not find any evidence that Clinton, who led the Department of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office, played a part in the rollback of the safety standards governing the protection of migrant children. Not only are the State Department and HHS separate executive agencies, but Clinton also stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, months before HHS decided to stop fingerprinting in the first of many decisions that led to the children’s mistreatment.
Your News Wire tried implicating Clinton in an old but otherwise real Senate report. The website did not respond to a request for comment.",0,YourNewsWire.com
"Says Bill Gates tweeted, ""I think Donald Trump will go down to history as one of the greatest presidents, just like Reagan."" A host of websites known for circulating dubious reports say that software magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates compared President Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan, but there’s no evidence that ever happened.
In the last few weeks, multiple outlets shared a fake tweet allegedly from Gates making the claim, ""After 17 minuts (sic) phone call with President Trump, I think he will go down as one of the greatest presidents just like Reagan."" The tweet, shown above, is dated Jan. 22, 2017.
Facebook flagged an example from Feb. 4, 2017 , as part of its efforts to winnow fake news from its users’ news feeds. It’s difficult to say where the item originated, but it’s now widespread , having been reposted as recently as Valentine’s Day .
Considering the dodgy grammar and spelling, the tweet itself likely came from a website allowing people to create fake tweets featuring real accounts. It’s not all that difficult to find one .
It’s also easy to see that Gates didn’t send the tweet. While he has more than 33 million followers, Gates isn’t nearly as prolific a thumb-masher as Trump.
The only tweet Gates appears to have sent on Jan. 22 was to congratulate former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes for being elected chairman of the Stanford University Board of Trustees.
The Internet Archive doesn’t show that he tweeted anything else that day , so it doesn’t appear Gates mentioned Trump and then deleted it. He doesn’t appear to have ever tweeted about Trump at all , although he has been somewhat critical of Trump in the past.
Gates did talk with Trump prior to his inauguration and did compare the real estate tycoon to a president — but it was John F. Kennedy, not Reagan.
""A lot of his message has been about where he sees things not as good as he'd like,"" Gates said on CNBC on Dec. 13, 2016 , about a phone call he had with Trump.
""But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it's education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump's) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind.""
Gates met with the then-president-elect face-to-face in New York’s Trump Tower later that day for about an hour.
""It was a good time,"" Gates said afterward. ""We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.""
But that tweet? Despite what scads of disreputable websites report, it never happened.",0,Bloggers
"Says Eric Trump said, ""My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway."" A fake Internet post on a website filled with extremely left-leaning stories quoted Eric Trump as saying President Donald Trump was going to end taxes for the rich, making the release of his father’s tax returns irrelevant.
The headline on an April 17, 2017, post on DemocraticMoms.com read, ""Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for WEALTHY people anyway.’"" The story was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news.
The post focuses on Donald Trump’s past promise to release his tax returns , referring to a tweet  he sent out on April 16 :
DemocraticMoms.com cites a fake interview Eric Trump supposedly gave with ""KXYL Radio."" The post reads:
""Eric argued that Trump’s tax return is ‘irrelevant,’ largely because ‘he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.’ He said, ‘When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.’""
The post goes on, but we know it’s fake, because it steals its content almost entirely from an April 16 story on Politicalo.com . The site is related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.""
Stories on sites under the Newslo.com umbrella take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know.
It appears DemocraticMoms.com edited some of the details of the original post, such as deleting Politicalo.com’s reference to another April 16 Donald Trump tweet backing off his promise to label China a currency manipulator :
The headline also has been changed. The original on Politicalo.com read, ""Eric Trump: ‘My father’s tax return is irrelevant because we’re going to cancel taxes for ""extra productive people"" anyway.’"" DemocraticMoms.com subbed in the word WEALTHY instead, IN ALL CAPS for extra effect.
Otherwise, the story contains entire paragraphs of Politicalo.com’s story (Neither version notes that the radio interview is fake; Politicalo.com calls KXYL an Orlando station, but it’s based in Texas .)
DemocraticMoms.com has a cryptic About Us description that says only that their ""team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn’t even know you needed!""
There was no apparent way to contact the site, but every post was steeped in anti-Trump fervor. No author information accompanies the profile that posted the article , either.

"Americans spend ""6.1 billion hours a year"" on tax preparation. Tax day has come around again, and with it a startling claim about the amount of time Americans spend doing their taxes each year.
According to U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., it takes United States taxpayers a total of 6.1 billion hours to file their taxes. That adds up to more than 695,000 years.
""6.1 Billion hours a year, just to figure out how much money the government is going to take,"" she said in a post on Twitter .
We had to check to see if this number could possibly be accurate.
According to Foxx’s office, the number comes from the Taxpayer Advocate Service’s 2013 report to Congress, which tackled the issue of the complexity of the U.S. tax code.
""In 2012, the National Taxpayer Advocate has designated the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as one of the most serious problems facing taxpayers,"" the report reads. ""The existing code, by our count, has reached nearly four million words and imposes unconscionable burden on taxpayers. Our analysis of IRS data indicates that individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax-filing requirements.""
It’s important to note that the report comes to the number by calculating the estimated combined time businesses and individuals spend filing taxes, not just that of private citizens.
The Taxpayer Advocate Service is an independent group within the Internal Revenue Service that is tasked with helping ""taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS and recommend changes that will prevent the problems.""
The number was calculated by multiplying the number of times each type of tax form was filed in 2010 by the amount of time the IRS estimates it takes to complete each form, according to Ken Drexler, a media relations officer at the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires federal agencies to estimate the amount of time it takes to fill out a given piece of paperwork.
""It’s the best number you can come up with, but it’s not necessarily a number you would take to the bank,"" Drexler said, noting it would take longer for someone unfamiliar with a form to complete it than someone who has done so many times before. Accountants and tax professionals, for example, could fill out the forms faster than an average filer.
In other words, the estimate might have flaws, but it is the best guess as to the time it takes for businesses and individuals to fill out tax paperwork.
In a 2011 report , the Laffer Center for Supply Side Economics further broke down the 6.1 billion hour figure, finding that individuals spend 3.16 billion of those hours filling out tax forms, while businesses clock in at 2.94 billion hours.
The estimate has remained the same since 2010. In 2009, the Taxpayer Advocate Service concluded Americans spent a whopping 7.6 billion hours completing the forms.",1,Virginia Foxx
"The Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate. On July 25, 2010, David Gregory, the host of NBC's Meet the Press , asked his roundtable panelists to consider ""Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege,"" a Wall Street Journal op-ed column from July 22, in which Sen. James Webb, D-Va., argues against federal affirmative action laws.
""I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship,"" Webb wrote. ""Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white. In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived.""
Marc Morial -- president of the National Urban League, a century-old civil rights organization -- was one panelist who took the challenge, arguing that non-whites continue to experience disadvantages compared to whites.
""I don't agree that Latinos and Asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that Native Americans have not suffered discrimination in this country,"" Morial said. ""I think the question is, how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and socially disadvantaged people. And it's a fair debate to have, but it also needs to be positive with facts. Look at the Latino unemployment rate. It's higher than the white rate. The black rate is higher than the Latino rate. So to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the Latino community, that affect the Native American community, most in depth, the African-American community, we've got to have the discussion that Jim Webb wants to have. We have facts, real facts, that give a picture of how life is in this nation.""
We won't take sides on Webb's proposal to end policies that provide race-based advantages, a topic that inspires passions on both sides, but which isn't a checkable fact. Instead, we'll focus on the narrower question of whether Morial is accurate on the question of comparative unemployment rates for whites, blacks and Latinos.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates seasonally adjusted unemployment rates by race and ethnicity. We found that in June 2010, the white unemployment rate was 8.6 percent. The black unemployment rate was 15.4 percent, and the Hispanic/Latino rate was 12.4.
So Morial is correct that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and that the black rate is higher than the Latino rate.
Though it falls beyond the boundaries of our fact-check, we'll note one other point from the statistics. Morial argued that Latinos and Asian Americans have suffered discrimination in the United States, and we think most people would agree with that at least as a historical matter. But if you look at the unemployment rate for Asians, it's 7.7 percent. That's actually lower than the rate for whites. (Technically, the BLS only calculates a non-seasonally-adjusted rate for Asians, but the comparable rate for whites is still higher at 8.7 percent.)
Still, as we indicated, Morial made no specific claim about unemployment among Asian-Americans, and for the groups that he did mention -- whites, blacks and Latinos -- his numbers were accurate.",1,Marc Morial
"""Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War."" A story that said President Donald Trump praised Kentucky Fried Chicken’s founder for saving Civil War troops from starvation at Valley Forge flunks the truth test.
Let’s do our own history lesson here: A May 2, 2017, post at TheRedShtick.com carried the headline, ""Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War."" The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The story played off a controversial comment Trump made on May 1 about former President Andrew Jackson, whom Trump readily admires .
During an interview on Sirius XM’s P.O.T.U.S. channel, Trump told the Washington Examiner's Salena Zito, ""I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.' ""
Trump drew criticism for the incident because his words neglect the fact that Jackson was a slave owner.
TheRedShtick.com used an excerpt from a May 1 New York Times story about the flap, then went off on its own invented tangent.
The post said Trump told their intern, Dave Robicheaux, that Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, was a ""tremendous Civil War hero.""
""Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter,"" the post read.
""Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.""
It should be pretty obvious that this story is more than a bit contrived, starting with the name of the post’s author, Manny Schewitz. (For the record, Trump does like the occasional KFC bucket .)
People coming to the story would certainly realize the post is fake if they visited the web pages’ About Us section. It says TheRedShtick.com is ""a bold and engaging source of satire and irreverent humor."" It said the site is a digital descendant of the defunct Red Shtick Magazine, formerly ""the only print satirical publication in Louisiana’s capital city"" of Baton Rouge (French for Red Stick). The print magazine ended in 2012, the site said.
There is a RedShtickMagazine.com , that carries similar graphics to TheRedShtick.com, but the two sites post different content. The magazine site appears to carry unrelated, intermittent blog posts about Thailand-centric issues and events, as far as we can tell.
Neither site makes its registration information public, but TheRedShtick.com publisher Jeremy White told us the publication once used the magazine’s domain name, but gave it up after going digital.
As for the Sanders story, White said that it should be obvious that it’s fabricated, but these days satire can be difficult to distinguish from reality.
""We earnestly endeavor to distinguish ourselves from peddlers of fake news — devoid of any real humor or any attempt to speak truth to power — who publish their fiction under the guise of satire,"" White said. ""They only muddy our national discourse in the pursuit of easy clicks.""

"Says ""James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With"" Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Take an FBI director controversially fired by President Donald Trump (James Comey), add in an ousted Democratic National Committee chairwoman (Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.), and whip up an air of illicit love and it’s not hard to assemble clickbait gold.
If you can suspend all common sense, that is.
The website Freedomcrossroads.us -- topped by a patriotic flag, a bald eagle, and the motto, ""AMERICA -- LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!"" -- recently ran an article headlined , ""BREAKING: The Democrat James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With Was JUST REVEALED! (DETAILS).""
The article posits that the website has uncovered an affair lasting at least eight months between Comey and Wasserman Schultz. (For the record, both are married.)
Let’s get quickly to the bottom line: This allegation is complete and utter hooey.
We are fact-checking it because Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news.
As of July 7, 2017, the post had been shared 2,200 times. A reprinted version at a separate site, thelastlineofdefense.org, prompted additional shares.
Comey’s paramour, according to the article, is ""none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie ""Whiny Democrat"" Wasserman Schultz — talk about a match made in Heave… errrrr… Hell! These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can’t accept defeat, but that doesn’t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?""
The website cites ""our exclusive sources"" to support the idea that the two ""couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they’re two liberal sickos — and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.""
The article suggests that Comey’s criticism of Trump, the man who fired him, stems from a desire to ""impress his GIRLFRIEND. Pathetic.""
Neither Comey’s nor Wasserman Schultz’s camp commented for this article, but debunking this item is straightforward: Freedomcrossroads.us is a self-styled parody site that operates for clicks that earn advertising money.
Its modus operandi is to troll social media users susceptible to believing overheated conservative rhetoric.
At the bottom of the home page , the site says, ""We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.""
On another page, the site informs readers , ""Freedom Crossroads is a magical place where patriots and God-fearing, Trump-loving Americans can go to find like-minded friends, read all about the buzz in the conservative community and be a part of the revolution to make America great again.""
The site, it says, ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today’s aging conservative. All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.""
Such disclaimers, however, are nowhere to be found on the actual article page, which makes it easy for some readers to miss the joke.",0,FreedomCrossroads.us
"""Obama-Led U.N. Has Just Made It Official, U.S. To Immediately Pay Blacks 'Reparations'."" A fake news story circulating online falsely says President Barack Obama has used the United Nations to somehow force the United States to pay African-Americans reparations for slavery.
The headline from the website Freedom Daily is wrong in every way and should be disregarded. ""Obama-Led U.N. Has Just Made It Official, U.S. To Immediately Pay Blacks ‘Reparations’,"" it read on Dec. 9, 2016 .
Freedom Daily, which bills itself as ""a forum for discussing meaningful conservative American and world news,"" quotes a story from a similar website called the Conservative Daily Post .
These websites ridicule a report from the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, a Geneva-based panel that had found the United States’ history of slavery had left a lasting impact on American society that justified reparations to African-Americans .
They presented their report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2016 . The group of global human rights experts concluded from their research that past transgressions had led to current strife in America.
""In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent,"" the report read. ""Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.""
The panel said progress had been made in America over the decades, but the nation was facing a ""human rights crisis"" brought on by the lingering racial discord.
The ""reparatory justice"" suggested by the panel includes considering benefits similar to those sought by a Caribbean coalition seeking reparations from European countries that colonized them. Those reparations encompass the possibilities of ""a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, an African knowledge programme, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation.""
Let’s first acknowledge that Obama doesn’t lead the United Nations, though the United States certainly holds sway over U.N. actions. The United States is a charter member of the group, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a significant financial contributor. But the body is led by South Korean Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who will be succeeded by Portuguese leader Antonio Guterres on Jan. 1, 2017 .
Furthermore, Obama has publicly said that he does not support the idea of financial reparations for slavery. He has said he’d prefer to focus on expanding access to jobs, health care, education and other programs to address the disadvantages minorities face.
Additionally, the panel’s findings are nonbinding. The United Nations isn’t forcing the United States to do anything. The report was an academic exercise to explore the legacy of slavery on modern America.
There’s nothing official about the report beyond its U.N.-sanctioned research. There certainly isn’t any plan for the federal government to pay such reparations, immediately or otherwise.",0,Freedom Daily
"""Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar."" President Barack Obama touted his energy strategy during his State of the Union speech .
He called for safe extraction of natural gas, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and setting new standards for trucks -- and he shined a spotlight on solar power.
""It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too,"" Obama said. ""Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced.""
That timetable sounded like a rapid expansion of solar: Does a home or business go solar every four minutes? We’ll shed a little light on this claim.
Solar expansion
Obama’s claim came from Greentech Media (GTM), which published the statistic in August in its Solar Market Research Report, a project with the Solar Energy Industries Association. GTM provides quarterly and annual reports that contain solar-specific analysis and forecasts for industry professionals.
A GTM chart shows how solar installations have rapidly increased in recent years from one every 80 minutes in 2006 to one every four minutes in 2013.
""A lot happens in America every four minutes,"" wrote GTM in an August blog about their research. ""During that short time period, 30 babies are born , 4,080 McDonald's Big Macs are consumed , and 48,000 tons of CO2 are emitted . And as it turns out, the U.S. is now installing one solar photovoltaic (PV) system every four minutes as well. If market growth continues at its current pace, the American solar industry could be installing a system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016.""
Every quarter GTM collects the number of solar installations from utilities and state agencies. Researchers get data from 28 states (including Florida ) which represents about 97 percent of the market and devise an estimate for the remaining states, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research. GTM has been tracking the solar market since 2009 and collected this particular detailed data since 2010. (Kann said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has some data on solar installations but not to the level of detail that GTM requires for quarterly reports.)
In 2013, there were about 132,000 installations, and there were 525,600 minutes, so the math works out to about one installation every four minutes. GTM is finalizing the number of installations in 2013 -- GTM says it’s possible it could have been higher.
Part of the reason for the rapid growth is that the cost of solar panels and installation has dropped, Kann said.
Experts on alternative energy generally agreed with GTM’s research but offered some caveats.
""Solar is growing, but from a very small number...,"" said Christopher Bronk, director of the Program on Energy and Cybersecurity at Rice University. According to the  November electric power monthly report from the Energy Information Administration, ""PV solar energy accounts for about 1.5 percent of all electricity generated from renewable sources and .2 percent percent of all the electricity generated.""
And not surprisingly, solar is more common in some states than others.
""As you move to places with a lot more cloud cover, let’s say Washington, D.C., then solar energy isn’t going to work as well,"" said Stephen P.A. Brown, an expert in energy economics at the University of Nevada. ""Unless there is some huge change in technology it’s not projected to be the dominant form of energy any time soon or in fact ever.""",1,Barack Obama
"Sarah Huckabee Sanders dressed up as KKK member on Halloween in 1993. A photo of a young girl dressed in Ku Klux Klan attire purported to be Sarah Huckabee Sanders is making the rounds on Facebook. Don’t believe it.
The photo was posted on the Facebook page Wake Up America and has over 2,700 shares. Red text on the photo purports it is Huckabee Sanders in Little Rock, Ark., on Halloween 1993. But it’s not. A reader asked us to look into the post to verify its accuracy.
The photo shows a child who appears to be younger than Huckabee Sanders; she would have been 11. The person in the photo also does not resemble known childhood photos of Huckabee Sanders.
More importantly, this photo already has been discredited on Snopes after it appeared on the satirical site FreeWoodPost.com in August 2012.
A sloppily photoshopped Chick-fil-A sign had then been layered over the picture.
That image accompanied a fake news story that purported Dan Cathy, the company’s president, had called for a racist controversy to stir up sales. The post followed news that counter-protests to Cathy’s opposition to gay marriage had caused a record spike in sales.
""Let’s milk this for all its worth,"" the fake news story credited Cathy as saying. ""Let’s wait until this gay thing dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says that we don’t like blacks either.""
Cathy confirmed to Snopes the marketing ploy was fake.
We found versions of this same image appearing as far back as 2008 , including on a Russian blog dezinfo.net. The Russian blog says the photos are part of a story of a woman who has been sewing KKK uniforms ""for many years.""
That appears to track back to a Mother Jones photo essay of ""Ms. Ruth,"" who reportedly ""sews hoods and robes for Klan members seven days a week, blessing each one when it’s done.""

"""Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening)."" About 1.3 million Americans rang in 2014 with a loss of long-term unemployment benefits , due to Congress’ failure to renew the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program before its Dec. 28 expiration.
Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama and director of the National Economic Council, is pushing Congress to extend the benefits. The Senate passed a key procedural hurdle Tuesday, but the House is not considered likely to follow suit.
To receive the benefits, the law requires that people actively look for jobs. On CNN’s State of the Union, Candy Crowley suggested that some people may be able to game the system. Sperling pushed back against that idea, emphasizing that a large majority of the unemployed are honestly trying to find jobs in a tough economy.
""Most of the people are desperately looking for jobs,"" he said. ""You know, our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening).""
We thought we’d check whether Sperling’s ratio of people to job openings is on target.
To check the 3-to-1 ratio, we needed to know two things: the number of available jobs and the number of unemployed Americans. A White House spokesman referred us to a couple of Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.
There were 3.925 million job openings in October, according to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from Dec. 10.
For an apples-to-apples comparison, we’ll use October unemployment numbers the BLS released in their Nov. 8 report, even though they’ve since published November data. They said 11.3 million people were unemployed. That just counts people who are actively looking for work, not those who have stopped looking due to discouragement or retirement.
That’s a ratio of 2.88-to-1 or, once you round off, roughly 3-to-1, just as Sperling said.
We should note a few caveats, though.
Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economics professor, pointed out that Sperling’s ratio isn’t perfect.
""The numbers that Sperling reported are about correct, but there is actually a lot more competition for jobs than that because many employed people are also applying for the same jobs that the unemployed are applying for,"" she said.
On the other hand, it’s worth noting that Sperling’s claim implies that for each job opening, there are three qualified applicants employers can choose from, but that’s a generous assumption.
""So it is possible for there to be a relatively high number of applicants for a job but employers may still feel like it is hard to hire because the people applying don't have the skills they are looking for,"" Sinclair said. ""Or people may not apply to the jobs that are out there because they are not a good fit for any number of reasons.""
James Sherk, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Sperling’s statistic is good for comparing change over time. For example, Sherk said, the economy is worse now than it was in 2006, though the ratio has been improving steadily as of late.
Also worth noting is that many employers fill vacancies without publicizing them. According to one report, employers with no recorded vacancies at the end of a month account for 42 percent of hires in the next month.
That means the number of job openings the BLS survey records will always understate the actual number of openings.",1,Gene Sperling
"""We've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector."" During the July 25, 2010 segment of ABC's This Week, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended President Barack Obama's economic track record. He specifically brought up the successes that the administration has had in boosting activity in the private sector.
""But right now, the best thing the government can do...is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good.""
We don't have the expertise to evaluate what constitutes ""pretty good"" job growth, but we can check the claim that the growth has been positive for the last six months.
We visited the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of our favorite federal number crunchers. On July 2, 2010, the bureau released its monthly Current Employment Statistics Highlights report. On page five, the report contains statistics on seasonally adjusted private sector employment going back to January 2000. Geithner specifically referenced the last six months of the current year, so that's where we focused our attention.
In December 2009, the private sector shed 83,000 jobs. That was significantly smaller than the average drop for the year, since the private-sector employment losses averaged 388,000 per month during 2009, according to the report. And so we come to 2010. How have we fared for the past six months? Here's a quick monthly summary of jobs added:
January: 16,000
February: 62,000
March: 158,000
April: 241,000
May: 33,000
June: 83,000
Data for the month of July --which wasn't over when Geithner spoke -- won't be released until August, so that's the most up-to-date data available. The report notes that data for the two most recent months are preliminary. But unless there's an unusually big after-the fact correction for either month, it's pretty clear that Geithner was correct. We've seen positive job growth in the private sector from January to June.",1,Timothy Geithner
"Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn't ""get political"" when it comes to Donald Trump. A story on Facebook said that actor Kurt Russell ""falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn’t crying over Hillary Clinton’s loss"" and doesn’t feel a need to announce his political opinions.
Russell said that ""the last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political,"" according to an article on Twentyeightmay , a pro-Donald Trump website. The story said that Russell showed Trump’s ""famous foes that it’s time to shut up about our president.""
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
The website uses actual quotes by Russell but omits when he actually said them, creating a false connection to Trump.
The Twentyeightmay story includes this quote by Russell:
""This is a business that’s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent. I don’t begrudge them that. I’m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways.""
The story said that Russell made those comments in response to Meryl Streep’s comments at the Golden Globes. But Streep’s criticism of Trump for imitating a disabled reporter occurred at the awards ceremony in January 2017 while that quote by Russell was published in September 2016 in an interview with Stephen Whitty, a freelance critic at the time for The New Jersey Star-Ledger .
Whitty told PolitiFact that Russell ""was talking, very generally, about being a libertarian or conservative in Hollywood"" and that he didn’t recall him ever mentioning any candidate by name.
The twentyeightmay story also said that Russell recently said: ""The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political.""
Russell did make that statement, but that was on The View in December 2015 when Whoopi Goldberg asked him about his recent comments that he believed gun control laws wouldn’t deter terrorists. At the time he made statements about gun control, he was discussing his upcoming movie The Hateful Eight, directed by Quentin Tarantino.
""The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political. It's just something I can't stand watching. So having said that, no, I was asked, I was asked to put it in context somehow with this movie. You know, my personal feeling is that there's a big difference between fantasyland and reality. Fantasyland is what we do. You're either writing something, writing a song, writing a book, doing a movie, doing a television show. That's fantasyland. And that’s where that stuff belongs.""
Russell continued, saying that people have different opinions about how to deal with terrorism and he talked about his views on why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment.

"""African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids."" In her speech to the National Urban League on July 31, Hillary Clinton presented a long list of statistics showing that racial inequality persists in the United States.
Among them was this figure: ""African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids."" Clinton claimed that it hit particularly close to home, as it reminded her of her time in the early 1970s working for the Children’s Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group for poor and minority children.
That number surprised us, so we decided to see if it was true and, if so, why.
Clinton may have underestimated
Asthma is a chronic lung disease — an inflammation of the airways that causes coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Around 25 million Americans have asthma, and the rate of asthmatics has been steadily increasing since the early 1980s. While most asthmatics function normally, often using inhalers to aid them in their breathing, asthma attacks can present a serious danger, especially in young children.
A 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on childhood asthma data from 1980 to 2005 confirms Clinton’s claim almost verbatim: ""Compared with white children, black children have a 260 percent higher ED (Emergency Department) visit rate, a 250 percent higher hospitalization rate, and a 500 percent higher death rate from asthma."" (Clinton’s campaign confirmed that this was the source she had used.)
The report also notes that even though mortality rates from asthma have decreased since 1999 for children in general, no corresponding drop has been seen in the mortality rate of African-American children.
There’s also more recent data available that further confirms Clinton’s claim, and even suggests she may have understated the problem.
One study from 2014 examines rates of childhood asthma in black and white children, with the most recent data from 2010. Despite making up a much smaller portion of the population, 106 black children died of asthma in 2010, compared to 68 white children. The corresponding rates of death for black and white children respectively are 8.6 per million and 1.2 per million — that means a black child is about 7.2 times more likely to die of asthma than a white child.
Even among those children of each race who already had asthma, black children had a mortality rate about 3.5 times higher than white children.
Notably, the study also shows that the racial disparity is not as severe for other problems with asthma; while black children have higher rates of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations, the difference in those cases is not as large as it is with the death rate.
Using CDC Wonder, a database of public health information, PolitiFact also checked the data for 2013, the last available year. In that time, 123 black children died of asthma compared to 83 white children. That corresponds to a death rate of 10.1 per million for black children and 1.5 per million for white children, which just about matches the 2010 numbers. The disparity for 2011 and 2012 was actually even greater, with the difference just about ten-fold.
Why the racial disparity?
According to the CDC, nobody is quite sure. ""Reasons for disparities are not well understood and are the subject of research by numerous investigators in university research centers,"" says a statement from the agency’s Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch.
However, there are studies that provide a couple of clues. For example, one examination of trends in preventive asthma medication use from 1988 to 2008 found that black and Mexican-American children were less likely to use the medication than white children.
Another study from 1997 found that inner-city children are more likely to develop allergies as a result of prolonged exposure to cockroach allergens. Since minorities are more likely to live in urban areas, this may go some way toward explaining higher rates of asthma morbidity and mortality.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union."" A Republican representative from Arizona contacted law enforcement in response to reports that Democrats planned to bring Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union.
""Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union,"" stated the Jan. 30 headline on USA Trainnews, a right-leaning website.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. However, we found that the article correctly cites Gosar’s efforts to summon law enforcement to arrest Dreamers.
The fate of Dreamers, which played a role in the January federal government shutdown, appears uncertain. In September, Trump announced that he was ending Obama’s program that temporarily deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants, prompting talks about how to come up with a permanent solution. A White House framework would offer a path to citizenship over 12 years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and other improvements, but members of both parties have raised objections.
Gosar, who was first elected to his Arizona district in 2010, received an A+ from NumbersUSA , a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration.
Gosar posted a few tweets from his U.S. House account at 1:33 p.m. Jan. 30, hours before Trump’s State of the Union address:
""Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.
""Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.
""Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.""
Gosar’s tweet drew criticism from members on both sides of the aisle on twitter.
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., fired back at Gosar:
""Oh my goodness, Rep. Gosar. Dreamers don't pose a threat to us,'' she tweeted . ""This is so drastic and cruel. Dios mío.""
A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that Ryan clearly does not agree"" with Gosar's suggestion.
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin tweeted: ""How many Republican members of the House and Senate will condemn this attempt to punish Dreamers who were brought to this country as kids?""
Gosar’s chief of staff Tom Van Flein told PolitiFact that Gosar spoke on the phone with the Capitol Police chief, but he didn’t know how the police ultimately responded to Gosar’s request.
We sent an email and left messages for spokespersons for the Capitol Police and the Justice Department and did not get a reply.

"""Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons."" A website twisted a real story about a criminal indictment against TV actress Allison Mack and made up details trying to tie her crime to the Clintons.
""Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons,"" stated an April 29 headline by The Newly Press . The same story appeared on the clickbait website Your News Wire .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Mack was indeed indicted, but the tie to the Rothschilds or Clintons is made up.
On Smallville, Mack played the role of Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark Kent’s best friends, starting in 2001.
Federal prosecutors in New York announced April 20 that Mack, 35, had been arrested. An unsealed indictment showed she and Keith Raniere faced charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy.
Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere.
""The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,"" stated Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization Nxivm, based in Albany. Prosecutors said that Nxivm maintained features of a pyramid scheme, as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants (""Nxians"") were encouraged to recruit others.
In 2015, Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called DOS, an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to ""Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions,"" or ""The Vow,"" according to prosecutors. DOS operated with levels of women ""slaves"" headed by ""masters.""
Raniere stood at the top of the pyramid while Mack was one of the women in the first level immediately below Raniere.
While The Newly Press article said that Mack confessed, court records show Mack pleaded not guilty on April 20. She was released on $5 million bail bond and is staying at her parents’ home in California under electronic monitoring.
The Newly Press story provided no evidence that Mack confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons. Instead, the story tried to force a link by tying a financial backer of Raniere -- Seagram heiresses Sara and Clare Bronfman -- with business interests of the Rothschilds and the Clinton Foundation.
While prosecutors wrote in a court document that Clare Bronfman has given Raniere millions of dollars over the years, the document makes no mention of Bill and Hillary Clinton or the Rothschilds, a famous wealthy family in the banking business.
The press release and the indictment also make no mention of the Rothschilds or the Clintons.

"The flu shot is ""designed to spread cancer."" Amid a severe flu season, an inaccurate story on Facebook said that the flu shot is laced with cancer-causing ingredients but provided no credible evidence.
""Doctor blows whistle on flu shot: ‘it’s designed to spread cancer,’"" said a Feb. 28 headline on Meddaily , an alternative medicine website.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We interviewed scientists who disputed the claim that the flu shot is linked to cancer.
The story largely focuses on comments by Dr. John Bergman. We were unsuccessful in reaching Bergman. We messaged him on Facebook and received an automated message back that he no longer answers private messages.
We searched for any credible newspaper articles that quoted a Dr. John Bergman about flu shots and found nothing.
Meddaily wrote that Bergman ""has revealed the influenza vaccinations being used to combat the latest H3N2 strain, are virtually ineffective and being forced onto the public through fear tactics to spread cancer.""
Meddaily also links to a video that has circulated for years by Dr. Joseph Mercola, who argues that the flu vaccine is ineffective. Mercola has been criticized by scientists and federal agencies for many years.
The Meddaily article offers no credible evidence that the flu shot causes cancer.
We sent the Meddaily article to three well-respected scientists who agreed the claims about the flu shot having ""cancer-causing ingredients"" or being ""designed to spread cancer"" were wrong.
""What does this even mean?"" said Aaron Carroll, a pediatrics professor at Indiana University. ""Wouldn’t you need evidence that it’s ‘designed to spread cancer’ to make such a claim? I mean, you’d have to think the absolute worst about humanity, including pediatricians, to believe that.""
William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that about 120 million to 150 million doses of the flu vaccine are given in the United States alone, in addition to millions of doses in other countries.
""Would the World Health Organization be promoting a cancer-promoting product? No,"" he said.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Feb. 26 statement that the flu this year has ""resulted in a record number of hospitalizations."" The federal government continues to research why the effectiveness is lower this year, however, a preliminary finding suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine.
The overall estimated effectiveness of the 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 36 percent , as of mid February.
The CDC continues to recommend the flu shot because it can prevent some infections with currently circulating flu viruses.
""Even with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated,"" the CDC wrote in February.

""Executive order leads to capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad,"" reads the headline on a Jan. 31, 2017, story at USAPoliticsZone.com. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the website’s efforts to identify potentially contrived news stories.
The story is false, however, and appears to have originated on a website chock full of fabricated content.
Trump’s Jan. 27 order barred citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. The order drew protests at airports nationwide.
Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Jan. 30 for refusing to enforce the order.
The action is currently on a nationwide temporary restraining order pending judicial review . You can review some key issues about the order in this explainer.
The next day, the website Times.com.mx posted the story that a suspected terrorist named Rasheen Muhammad had been arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. It included a photo of a handcuffed man flanked by men in FBI windbreakers.
The story said stricter screening procedures in place because of the order were to credit, and said Yates apologized via Snapchat for being wrong. The story also quoted FBI Director James Comey as saying details would not be released as the agency investigates.
None of these things happened.
There was no arrest of any person named Rasheen Muhammad at JFK, terrorist or otherwise. The only Rasheen Muhammad we could find in a news search during the proper time frame was a 19-year-old gang member in Chicago being held in Cook County Jail on Feb. 4 for a juvenile warrant.
Yates, who had said she was not sure Trump’s order was legal, also did not apologize for refusing to enforce it. There are no reports of such an apology, whether on Snapchat or otherwise.
Comey also did not address the arrest, seeing as how the arrest never happened.
Times.com.mx is another website that attempts to imitate legitimate news outlets with fake stories to lure readers. USAPoliticsZone.com and several other sites copied the story verbatim.
None of the photographs are of someone named Rasheen Muhammad. Anyone with eyes can see that the three photos are actually of different people:
One photo, which also ran on Times.com.mx, is of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghanistan-born Denver man arrested in September 2009 for ties to an al-Qaida plot to commit suicide bombings on the New York subway.
USAPoliticsZone.com also added this image, which is of Sajmir Alimehmeti. The Bronx, N.Y., man was arrested in May 2016 on charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization for failed attempts to join or aid ISIS.
Finally, USAPoliticsZone.com included this image, a still from a video of Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who really was an ISIS leader. Al-Adnani, considered the official spokesman for the Islamic State, was reportedly killed while fighting in Syria last fall.

"Says that singer Dolly Parton said, ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together."" Singer Dolly Parton praises President Donald Trump as outperforming his predecessors -- or at least that’s what a fake story on Facebook proclaims.
""Singer Dolly Parton: ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 Years’ of Bush, Obama ‘Put Together,’"" stated a Jan. 22 headline on Americanproud.info.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. It is. The story took a quote by a consultant who served in George W. Bush’s administration and and falsely attributed it to Parton.
Earlier this month, Brett Decker spoke about consumer confidence and the economy. in a radio interview with Breitbart .
""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of those guys put together,"" he said.
The Americanproud.info story also used an actual quote by Parton in an interview with CNN in August 2016 , but omitted the full context of her comments.
""We’re doing good,"" Parton told CNN. ""We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.""
Americanpround.info included that snippet in its report, but went on to say that Parton ""saw the light"" and later called Hillary Clinton ""nuts"" and that her campaign has been ""just crazy.""
In reality, all those comments were actually from the same CNN interview, but Americanproud.info distorted what Parton actually said.
When asked about Clinton and Trump , here’s Parton’s full remarks:
""I don't know where they're going to land but I think they're both nuts"" she said, joking that ""it's like watching the OJ Simpson trial. You just believe whoever's up next. Whoever testified last is who you believe.""
In the CNN interview, Parton doesn’t come across as committed to either candidate. CNN paraphrased her as saying she might not know who she will vote for and that it's time that both Trump and Clinton stopped talking about each other.
In June 2016, the  New York Times  asked Parton how she felt about a female presidential nominee.
""Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it’s Hillary or Donald Trump, we’re gonna be plagued with PMS either way — presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary’s very qualified. So if she gets it, I’ll certainly be behind her.""
After much publicity about that quote, Parton issued a statement.
""My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race.""
Proclaiming that a celebrity now loves Trump or hates Clinton is a common theme in fake news stories. We debunked an article that said Sandra Bullock said to Clinton ""if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again"" and that ""Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet’ "" We rated both statements Pants on Fire.
In this case, the story that said Parton said, ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together"" is also fake news. A consultant actually made a statement that virtually mirrors that quote.",0,Americanproud.info
"""Breaking: woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct."" A fake news story said a Washington Post reporter offered a woman money if she would accuse Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of a crime.
""Breaking: Woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct,"" stated a Nov. 13 headline in Evening World, which is similar to an earlier story by The Gateway Pundit , a website that posts some fake news .
The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. The allegations have become the hot topic in his Dec. 12 race against Democrat Doug Jones.
Facebook users flagged the Evening World story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is based on a since-deleted twitter account and is fake.
The website based the claim that a Post reporter offered money to a woman by citing the Twitter account of @umpire43 who identified himself as Doug Lewis #MAGA.
""A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????,"" Lewis tweeted Nov. 10 .
One of the Post reporters who wrote about Moore was Beth Reinhard.
Lewis also tweeted that the family friend had photographs of the reporter and had recorded the telephone conversation. He directed her to bring that information to her local district attorney’s office.
Lewis wrote that ""Jean"" provided evidence to the Etowah County District Attorney in Alabama.
Multiple news outlets including The Daily Beast , the  Post and Snopes reported in November that @umpire43 had since deleted his account. The account user had a history of perpetuating hoaxes .
The Daily Beast reported that the author of the account had repeatedly invented stories about his own background claiming to be a Navy veteran, a pollster, a baseball umpire, an expert on rigged voting machines, an American consulate worker in Calgary and ""a beleaguered soul who needed time off after the 9/11 attacks when he saw Muslims ‘dancing on rooftops.’ ""
The Daily Beast contacted all of his alleged employers and affiliates and found that he hadn’t held any of the positions.
The Twitter account launched in 2011 peaked at around 18,000 followers by the time that the Gateway Pundit reported on his claim against the Post. Tweets from @umpire43 had drawn attention from InfoWars and other right-wing sources.
The Gateway Pundit added a an update at the bottom of its story about @umpire43’s tweets: ""We have not been able to confirm these allegations by Doug Lewis.""
Reinhard, the Post reporter targeted in the fake news story, directed PolitiFact to a spokeswoman for the Post, Shani George.
""The accusation against the Post is categorically false,"" George told PolitiFact in an email. ""We have an explicit policy that prohibits paying sources.""
We found no contact information or disclaimer on the Evening World’s website, eveningw.com . The pro-Donald Trump website lifts accounts from other conservative websites. ( The Evening World was an actual newspaper that published in New York City from 1887-1931).
There is no evidence that a Post reporter offered a woman money to make an accusation against Moore.",0,Evening World
"In Massachusetts, ""half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients."" As the fallout from President Barack Obama’s health care law takes center stage, some critics are raising concerns about how much access Americans will have to insurance and physicians in the future.
On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a physician and a critic of Obamacare, and Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania who supports the law, faced off.
At one point, they debated the situation in Massachusetts, where a law similar to Obamacare was signed in 2006.
As evidence that the federal law won’t work, Fleming said that in Massachusetts, ""half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients.""
His point was that even if you have insurance, you won’t necessarily be able to see a doctor.
We decided to check Fleming’s statistic to see if it’s correct.
The statistic comes from an annual survey by the Massachusetts Medical Society, a professional association founded in 1781 that, among other things, publishes the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
The 2013 edition of the society’s ""Patient Access to Care"" survey -- which was based on 1,137 phone interviews with Massachusetts physicians -- found that 51 percent of family medicine practitioners in the state were accepting new patients. As Fleming indicated, almost exactly half are not.
We will point out a few caveats, none of which seriously undercut Fleming’s claim.
• While ""family medicine"" is certainly one type of ""primary care doctor,"" there are others. One type, internal medicine doctors, had a lower percentage (45 percent) accepting new patients, but another, pediatricians, had a higher percentage (70 percent).
• There is substantial regional variation even within Massachusetts. The largest county in the state, Middlesex, had more doctors accepting new patients, at rates five to eight percentage points higher than the state as a whole. Other counties, such as Suffolk, had rates well below the state average.
• Your likelihood of being accepted as a new patient depends heavily on what kind of insurance you have. Family medicine doctors accept 90 percent of new Medicare patients and 70 percent of patients with MassHealth, the state’s vehicle for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program.
The 2013 survey did not look at new-patient acceptance rates for those who had private insurance or for patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice, the programs created under the 2006 law to insure those who previously had no insurance.
However, data from the society’s 2011 survey does show a danger sign for those worried that doctors will be unwilling to take patients newly insured by the national health care law.
The 2011 survey found that family medicine physicians were significantly less likely to accept new patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice -- 56 percent and 44 percent, respectively -- than they were new Medicare and Medicaid patients.
Equally striking, the survey found, the percentage of family doctors taking new patients with any type of insurance has fallen since 2007 from 70 percent to 51 percent.
That said, determining whether Massachusetts is out of line on any of these benchmarks is tricky, since comparable data for other states is virtually nonexistent, and the available national data is calculated differently and is several years old.",1,John  Fleming
"""Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster."" A misleading headline purporting to link Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin to a mysterious New York death has blown a small connection way out of proportion.
""Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster,"" said a July 12, 2018, headline from Mad World News , a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before.
This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""Another dead body has turned up in connection to Hillary Clinton,"" the story said. ""This time, the remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary has gone into hiding as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction.""
Authorities did find a woman dead in the trash compartment of a New York apartment building on July 10, 2018. But allegations implicating Clinton or Abedin in the incident are uncorroborated.
Let’s take a look at what actually happened, according to credible reports detailing the tragedy.
On July 10, police responded to Zeckendorf Towers, an upscale apartment complex in New York. There, they ""discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor,"" police told the New York Post . The woman, who was later identified as building resident Lara Prychenko, was found by a maintenance worker.
Surveillance video later showed her in a nearby elevator moments earlier, where she left her handbag before entering the hallway. Police later told reporters they believed she may have fallen down the chute while drunk.
Abedin and her ex-husband, imprisoned former congressman Anthony Weiner, previously owned an apartment in the same complex. The former couple reportedly owned the apartment for multiple years, but listed it for rent on March 19, 2017, the same day Weiner pleaded guilty for explicit texts to a minor and Abedin filed for divorce. The listing was taken off the market days later, though it is not clear whether the apartment was sold or taken off the market for another reason.
Most news outlets referred to the building as a place that Abedin ""used to call home.""
Regardless, the trash compactor where the dead woman was found was commonly shared. It was not ""Abedin’s dumpster,"" despite what the Mad World News story said.
Further, apartment residents did not tell cops and NBC ""they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction."" According to the NBC report cited in the Mad World News story, the neighbors actually ""said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner.""
Clinton, for her part, has not actually gone into hiding. She has been active criticizing President Donald Trump and promoting her upcoming events on Twitter and Facebook. Three days after the body was discovered, she addressed a teachers union conference in Pittsburgh. She is also set to attend a festival in New York on July 21, 2018, according to her Twitter .

"""Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap."" In case you need an incentive to stay awake on the job, a nap cost a Texas morgue employee his life, claims a fake news story.
""Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap,"" states the headline on worldnewsdailyreport.com, a website that posts a disclaimer stating that it is satirical.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
This fake article has been circulating on Facebook at least since March and a more recent version copies the story but changes the location to Macomb, Mich . The story has gained enough attention that Texas police have had to publicly refute it.
The article stated that an employee of the Jefferson County morgue, Henri Paul Johnson, decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for 16 hours straight.
""While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory,"" stated the website.
Jenna Davis, a morgue employee, claimed that the coworker who caused the accidental cremation was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.
The Beaumont Police opened a criminal investigation, the website stated.
Actually, the police department did no such thing.
Carol Riley, public information officer for the police department, told PolitiFact that her department was inundated with phone calls about the story when it first appeared months ago.
""People were sharing it on our Facebook messenger, they were calling our local media, calling to see if it had any teeth to it,"" Riley said.
The story is ""absolutely fake news,"" she said. ""It did not happen.""
Helga Briscoe, administrator for Forensic Medical that does autopsies for 14 counties including Jefferson County, told PolitiFact that the privately-run facility doesn’t even do cremations.
A search of the photos in Google Images shows that the photos were lifted from other news stories.
The photo of the alleged Jenna Davis, the morgue coworker, is actually Dr. Lisa Funte , a  forensic pathologist at the morgue photographed by the Beaumont Enterprise newspaper in 2012.
But the photo of the wide-eyed smiling man who was allegedly cremated was totally unrelated to the morgue: it matches the image of a DeSoto County constable arrested for DUI in 2015 , Snopes found .

"""Foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire budget."" President Barack Obama’s April 13 speech on federal debt and spending contained plenty of interesting claims, and we’ll be checking those in the coming days.
We wanted to start with with a remark the president made to back up his contention that politicians often focus their deficit-cutting rhetoric on hot-button programs that are just a small portion of the federal budget.
Politicians in both parties, he said, ""suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1% of our entire budget.""
We wondered if foreign aid really makes up such a small portion of federal spending.
In February, PolitiFact checked a claim by Ross Douthat, a columnist at The New York Times. Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that True , noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion.
Those 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget.
What about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget.
If you’re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here’s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid.
So Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget.",1,Barack Obama
"""If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. ... But if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries"" then you can stay in the United States. Why are so many children pouring across the southwest U.S. border? The answer is partly U.S. law, said a Texas congressman on CNN’s State of the Union on July 6, 2014.
Candy Crowley, CNN’s host, asked Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, ""Why are they coming in such numbers? What do you think prompts these numbers right now?""
Cuellar answered, ""If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. Mother, kids, adults, you're sent back, but if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries, then the law says that you are going to be held, (and) Health and Human Services, they're going to place you. That’s the law that we need to change right now.""
We looked into the claim and found that Cuellar wasn’t crossing any lines.
With an influx of about 52,000 child immigrants at the border since October, the conversation has shifted to explanations. Which brings us to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 . Some have cited it as the catalyst for the increase in illegal immigration.
President George W. Bush signed the law on Dec. 23, 2008; it received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide.
The law was never intended to encourage mass immigration from noncontiguous countries. But the law’s Section 235 did change the policies and procedures for handling unaccompanied alien children.
Section 235, entitled ""Enhancing Efforts to Combat the Trafficking of Children,"" requires humane treatment of minors crossing the border from foreign nations. It also mandates ""safe and secure placements,"" calling for careful consideration when placing unaccompanied minors in residences within the United States.
The law lays out one procedure for child immigrants from contiguous countries, like Mexico and Canada, and another for children from noncontiguous countries, like El Salvador or Honduras.
Child immigrants from contiguous countries are processed for immediate return to their home country. In all other cases, the children are placed under the responsibility of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These children are placed with family or in other residences while they await their immigration court date. Long story short, they get to stay in the United States.
The law seems to assume that alien children from noncontiguous countries were likely to be the victims of human trafficking, and it guarantees these minors access to legal counsel and child advocates.
Experts said Cuellar was right, and the law was never intended to allow immigrant children from Central America to remain in the United States.
""Representative Cuellar's characterization is mostly right,"" said Dan Cadman, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. The law ""has actually fueled an industry in the smuggling of minors. Contrary to intent, it has proven to be an inducement to wholesale smuggling of minors from noncontiguous countries.""
The House GOP task force, assembled by speaker John Boehner to address the immigration crisis, issued a statement this week calling for changes to the law. ""We agree with the president that (these children) must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.""
On July 9, 2014, Cuellar said that he is introducing legislation to make the repatriation of minors from noncontiguous countries easier and faster by revising the law.",1,Henry Cuellar
"""Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.' "" Donald Trump has suggested that paid protesters targeted his rallies during the 2016 campaign, and even stronger charges from conspiracy websites such as Infowars have flooded the Internet.
If such claims piqued your interest and you plugged ""paid protesters"" into Google at mid-day on Nov. 17, at the top of the list is this one: "" Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally .' ""
The link cites not one but two seemingly mainstream media outlets. It’s credited to ""abcnews.com.co"" and includes the abbreviation ""(AP),"" which is how the Associated Press marks its stories.
But the story doesn’t have anything to do with ABC News, and it doesn’t have anything to do with the Associated Press. It is 100 percent fake.
It was created by Paul Horner, who posts fake news on a variety of websites. Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google’s news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an interview with the Washington Post -- $10,000 a month in ad sales.
In the Post interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500.
""His followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything,"" Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, ""His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist."" Here’s a screenshot of Lewandowski’s since-deleted tweet:
Asked by the Post’s Caitlin Dewey why he posted the fake story, Horner responded, ""Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests — trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.""
The story’s high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner’s decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11.
Automated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has regularly debunked articles from websites operated by Horner.
Horner even quoted himself by name in the fake story, something he does in many of his posts.
PolitiFact has also debunked at least three fake Horner stories in recent years. PolitiFact was unable to reach Horner independently.",0,Bloggers
"The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates ""beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980."" For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday.
Many forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge.
""The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980,"" said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer on CNN’s State of the Union on Nov. 2.
It’s commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats?
We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring.
In 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats (nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.). Spicer is correct to say they haven’t beat more than two incumbents since then.
We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution’s most recent "" Vital Statistics on Congress "" report. (h/t to Sabato’s Crystal Ball .) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa.
From 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans’ biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively.
Senate Democrats haven’t had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since 1981, they’ve beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans’ 12.
So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past.
If Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times’ election model has as the most likely outcome ), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats.
What made 1980 so special? In the same election , former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter’s struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections.
Compare that to this year’s Senate elections where, although there is no presidential election, Republicans are using President Barack Obama’s relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats.",1,Sean Spicer
"""Clinton Foundation ordered to cease operations – Chelsea (Clinton) charged with fraud!"" A fake news story that reads like a page out of conspiracy theory Mad Libs said that Chelsea Clinton was charged with essentially stealing from the Clinton Foundation, which had been ordered to shut down.
""Clinton Foundation ordered to cease operations – Chelsea charged with fraud!"" read the headline on a May 3, 2017, post on Liberty-Courier.com .
The post was flagged as being potentially fake by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from user feeds.
Among the numerous allegations made in the post, it said Chelsea Clinton was CEO of the Foundation (that would currently be Kevin Thurm ; Chelsea is vice chair ). The foundation had been told to stop operating, although the post didn’t say who or what made such a demand.
For the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect.
The story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads:
""During (Hillary) Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories.
""Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle.""
For the record, Gen. George Hammond was the one-time leader of the fictional Stargate Command . We also highly doubt Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton went toe-to-toe over Scattergories at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly ""used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents.""
We found several examples of this story online , most of which appeared to point back to the same May 3 post at USAPoliticsToday.com .
The only source cited in that story was a Nov. 6, 2016, article from the New York Post. That article said there was evidence from WikiLeaks’ hack of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails that Chelsea Clinton had taken money from the foundation to pay in part for her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker had examined that same claim in January 2017 , noting that the New York Post was the only U.S. newspaper to run the story, which was picked up by British tabloids and right-leaning news outlets like Fox News.
""Despite the breathless reporting, it’s hard to tell exactly what is going on in the email exchange , which is dated Jan. 4, 2012,"" the Post’s Glenn Kessler wrote. ""There is no mention of actual Foundation monies being used for the wedding.""
Chelsea Clinton herself has decried how the Clinton Foundation has been a target of fake news outlets and conspiracy theorists.
""The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn’t seem sufficient to put them to rest,"" she told Variety magazine in April . ""I think that was so odd about the whole experience — either the truth was insufficient or people just didn’t care.""

"By 2009, ""dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield"" by drones. In Hillary Clinton’s new memoir, Hard Choices, the former secretary of state defends the administration’s use of drone strikes in the face of knotty ethical and legal questions.
In chapter 9 of the book, Clinton says drone strikes quickly became ""one of the most effective and controversial elements of the Obama Administration’s strategy against al Qaeda and like-minded terrorists.""
She goes on to defend the careful planning of the strikes and their legal grounding, as well as their strategic value. But we were especially interested in one claim she made: ""President Obama would eventually declassify many of the details of the program and explain his policies to the world, but in 2009 all I could say was ‘no comment’ whenever the subject came up. Yet it was widely known that dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones, and we later learned that bin Laden himself worried about the heavy losses that drones were inflicting.""
Is that correct?
First, some background. Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries. (Here’s a previous fact-check in which we looked at this issue.) Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil.
In defense of the program, officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations.
Tallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging, for obvious reasons -- they are done with tight secrecy. Although breaking down this data is difficult to do as a layperson, experts we checked with suggest that the claim that U.S. drone strikes have killed ""dozens"" of senior terrorists may well be an understatement.
""Hillary Clinton’s statement is 100 percent correct,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""That’s a conservative estimate.""
There are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties they cause, but an analysis by the New America Foundation, a think tank, found that as of 2013, drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen. In just those two countries, drones have killed between 2,861 and 4,452 people in all -- civilians and unknowns, in addition to militants, according to the foundation’s study. (Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes, though attacks have also occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Philippines.)
Clinton, though, uses the ""dozens"" number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009. A look through another non-governmental database -- created by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , a philanthropically funded investigative-journalism project based in the United Kingdom -- appears to provide support for Clinton’s claims.
We sifted through the project’s aggregated news reports about confirmed and suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. primarily sends drones to target members of al-Qaida and its affiliates. We searched for reported deaths of terrorists and militants described as ""senior,"" ""leader"" or ""commander"" through the end of 2009.
Under these reasonably restrictive conditions, we found roughly three dozen top terrorists killed. Looking just at articles compiled by the  Washington Post , we come up with at least two dozen.
This number is nowhere near definitive, since it includes several deaths that are disputed. On the other hand, the number could be higher since it doesn’t include information from unreported strikes or strikes in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq or Philippines.
Despite these caveats, a conservative analysis of the evidence does suggest a factual basis for Clinton’s claim.
A final note: Clinton also appears to be right about bin Laden being concerned about drones.
A trove of letters found at Osama bin Laden’s compound after his 2011 death reveal that he was concerned about America’s drone use . In an October 2010 letter, he revealed that he was particularly worried about attacks in Waziristan, a region of Afghanistan.
""I am leaning toward getting most of the brothers out of the area,"" he wrote. ""We could leave the cars because they are targeting cars now, but if we leave them, they will start focusing on houses and that would increase casualties among women and children. It is possible that they have photographed targeted homes. The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay, but move to new houses on a cloudy day.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Trump’s DHS secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders."" A headline on a website called Newsflash overstates efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities and their elected officials.
""Trump’s (Department of Homeland Security) secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders,"" said an undated headline on flashnewss.club , operating under the banner ""Newsflash.""
Sanctuary cities refers broadly to jurisdictions with policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Donald Trump has promised to withhold federal funds from these cities, claiming they attract criminals and make communities less safe.
The story also claimed ""it won’t be long until Trump’s DHS gets a warrant for pioneers"" of communities and states with ""haven city strategies.""
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
We found that there is an element of truth to the claim, but it is also a sweeping exaggeration of what’s been said.
At a Jan. 16 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about a comment made by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official on Fox News. The official, Thomas D. Homan, said on TV that he asked the Justice Department to look into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies, Harris said. The comment was made specifically about California elected officials after the enactment of the California Values Act , according to Harris.
Harris: ""My question is whether DHS is currently working with the Justice Department to bring section 8-USC 1324 charges or any criminal charges against state or local officials.""
Nielsen: ""I believe the request was made. The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. The context of this is, of course, not only putting my ICE officers at risk but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our immigration laws.""
Harris: ""So, you are aware of cases in which this code will be used to criminally charge elected officials?""
Nielsen: ""I am not aware of any cases, no ma'am. I believe it was just a request to look into it.""
At the hearing, Nielsen acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security had asked the Justice Department to look into the issue, but did not confirm, as Newsflash claimed, that they are already preparing to make arrests. The website also presented a revised version of what Nielsen said, quoting her as saying ""The Department of Justice is looking into what roads might be accessible."" (She said: ""The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available."")
DHS referred PolitiFact to the January hearing but did not say what avenues, if any, the Justice Department had determined to take — or if it had responded to DHS’ request. The Justice Department did not respond to our query.
Newsflash cited the The Washington Times as the source that ""revealed"" the information. A January story on The Washington Times headlined, ""Homeland Security pursues charges against leaders of sanctuary cities."" The story offers a more toned-down version, saying DHS ""has asked federal prosecutors to see if they can lodge criminal charges against sanctuary cities.""",0,Newsflash
"""Young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve."" During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked whether he would consider giving companies a tax break if they hired honorably discharged veterans.
Obama said it’s an idea that he’s ""been talking a lot about internally. We’ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we’re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve. And that makes no sense.""
We wondered whether Obama was right about unemployment among recent veterans, so we took a look at federal statistics.
We found a recent table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that breaks down employment status for veterans and non-veterans.
It reported that in May 2011, veterans from the post-9/11 period had an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent. By comparison, non-veterans that month had an 8.5 percent unemployment rate. So Obama was correct.
It’s worth noting that since post-9/11 veterans account for a tiny fraction of the entire labor force -- a bit over 1 percent -- and because the BLS did not seasonally adjust the numbers, these figures are subject to a lot more volatility than the unemployment rate for all workers.
For instance, in March and April 2011, unemployment for post-9/11 veterans was 10.9 percent, or more than a full point lower than it was in May. Going further back, it bounced around quite a bit -- 12.5 percent in February 2011, 15.2 percent in January 2011, and 11.7 percent in December 2010. Still, even the lowest of these figures were comfortably ahead of the comparable unemployment rates for non-veterans.
The other issue we’ll mention is that post-9/11 veterans are an exception to a more general rule. Typically, veterans of earlier military actions have unemployment levels similar to, or even lower than, non-veterans.
Consider the statistics for May 2011. As post-9/11 veterans saw their unemployment rate hit 12.1 percent, veterans of the first Gulf War were seeing a 7 percent unemployment rate, veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam were seeing 7.4 percent unemployment and veterans from other periods saw a rate of 7.9. Each group’s rate was clearly lower than the 8.5 percent unemployment rate for non-veterans.
Still, none of this undercuts Obama’s claim. If you interpret his remark -- that ""young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve"" -- to mean post-9/11 veterans, then the rates have indeed been significantly higher than for non-veterans over at least the last six months.",1,Barack Obama
"""Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled."" President Donald Trump proposed eliminating a program to help millions of Americans heat or cool their homes, according to a viral story by a liberal website.
""Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled,"" stated the Nov. 26 headline by Democrats Rising , an anti-Trump website.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story failed to tell the entire story: while Trump proposed getting rid of a heating assistance program several months ago, the federal government has continued to fund it.
The Democrats Rising article, written as winter weather was setting in, misleads by stating that millions of households will be at risk of losing heat this winter. But that’s not what the facts show.
Democrats Rising didn’t name the program, but it appears to be a reference to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a program started in 1981. The program provides federal dollars to help poor people pay their home energy bill, energy crises, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs. On average, the annual heating/winter crisis assistance benefit per household was $371 in fiscal year 2015 .
In March, Trump’s budget blueprint called for cutting money for several programs that help low-income Americans including LIHEAP. The document said that LIHEAP ""is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes.""
The budget request for the Administration for Children and Families stated that utility companies and state and local governments provide significant heating and cooling assistance and that the majority of states prohibit utilities from discontinuing heat during the winter.
Trump’s proposal faced pushback from senators, including many in cold weather states.
A bipartisan group of a few dozen senators wrote a letter in September urging the federal government to release funds for LIHEAP as quickly as possible under the continuing resolution.
U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., led the bipartisan group to push for $3.39 billion, the same amount allocated in the previous fiscal year.
On Sept. 8, Trump signed the continuing resolution to continue funding appropriations for a few months. That allowed the Department of Health and Human Services in October to release $3.03 billion for states, tribes and territories for the heating program for fiscal year 2018. That represents 90 percent of the funding available under the continuing appropriations act.
We asked a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services when the remaining 10 percent will be provided. Trump’s proposed budget did not include funding for LIHEAP, Monique Richards said. Funding will be determined by the passage of appropriations legislation from Congress.
In the past, the federal government has released 90 percent of the funding under a ""seasonability exception,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association.
""Because LIHEAP spends so early in the fiscal year, if funding was delayed it would cause a hardship to low-income families,"" he said.
A spokesman for Trump did not respond to our questions.",0,Democrats Rising
"In 2010, uninsured voters made up ""about 5 percent of the electorate."" Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer ruffled some feathers among his own party recently when he said passing Obamacare was the wrong thing to do.
In remarks at the National Press Club Nov. 25 , Schumer, of New York, said it wasn’t politically prudent for the Democrats in Congress to focus their energy on health care. The vast majority of voters who brought President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats into office in 2008, Schumer said, wanted policy that addressed the recession, not health insurance.
In fact, he said, uninsured voters -- those who would get many of the law’s immediate benefits -- were a relatively insignificant portion of the electorate.
""The Affordable Care Act was aimed at the 36 million Americans who were not covered,"" Schumer said. ""It's been reported that only a third of the uninsured are even registered to vote. In 2010, only about 40 percent of those registered voted. So even if the uninsured kept with the rate, which they likely didn't, you would still only be talking about 5 percent of the electorate.""
There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we’re most interested in the last part of Schumer’s claim: that uninsured voters only made up 5 percent of the electorate in 2010, the year Congress passed the Affordable Care Act.
We asked Schumer’s office where they got that stat. They laid out for us their calculations, using figures from the  U.S. Census Bureau  and the Election Project , a website run by a University of Florida professor that tracks election data.
Well, we crunched the numbers ourselves, and our results lined up with Schumer’s.
Here’s how we got those figures. In 2010, about 42.6 million people of voting age were uninsured, according to the Census . Of those 42.6 million, we estimated that 14.6 percent -- or 6.2 million -- are illegal immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute , meaning they are not eligible voters.
This brings us down to about 36.4 million eligible voters who do not have health insurance.
We should note that this figure does not account for people who are ineligible to vote for other reasons, such as a felony conviction. Additionally, Schumer’s office came up with a slightly lower count than we did.
The next step is to find out how many of these 36.4 million uninsured eligible voters actually voted in 2010. That year , 41.8 percent of the voting-eligible population in the United States voted in the general election. Schumer said in his National Press Club remarks that he assumed that voter turnout among the uninsured reflected overall voter turnout. And 41.8 percent of the 36.5 million uninsured eligible voters is 15.2 million.
Then we calculated what percentage of the total electorate (217.6 million) are these 15.2 million uninsured eligible voters -- 7 percent, compared to Schumer’s 5 percent figure.
In any case, both Schumer’s and our calculations potentially overestimate the number of uninsured people who voted in the 2010 general election.
That’s because the uninsured population is less likely to vote than the insured population. An October 2014 Pew Research Center study found that of all ""likely voters,"" 93 percent have insurance coverage, and only 7 percent do not have coverage. (Compare this to the general population, of which 13.4 percent is uninsured, as of October 2014 .)
""I believe (the Pew figures support Schumer’s) point on the more limited potential impact of the uninsured vote on this election,"" said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University.
Additionally, the uninsured population has a lower level of voter registration than the insured, according to a 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. The poll found that 64 percent of uninsured people are registered to vote, compared to 86 percent of insured people.",1,Charles Schumer
"""One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left"" on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Insurance providers are ""fleeing"" Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, President Donald Trump said at a March 13 ""listening session"" on health care.
""One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left,"" Trump said , adding that the Republican replacement for the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare will have ""far more choices, at a lower cost.""
Trump has the right statistic about insurance provider participation. In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016.
In several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there’s only one insurance provider total participating in each state’s online marketplace in 2017.
That’s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties — and one state, Wyoming — were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges.
On the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11.
It’s important to note that Trump’s claim doesn’t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there’s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser.
So of the approximately 9.2 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company.
These individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn’t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost.
Insurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges — including UnitedHealthGroup , Humana and Aetna — have said they were losing money by participating.
Among plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a standard measurement used by the Department of Health and Human Services — what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan — average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017.
""Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces — that's important for keeping costs down,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ""But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others.""
Glied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated before the Affordable Care Act, too .",1,Donald Trump
"""What happens is people like Warren Buffett — and he says this himself...pay 15 percent on the millions of dollars that they earn from wealth income... while their secretary is paying a higher rate on her work income. It's not right."" Warren Buffett doesn't just make oodles of dollars, his tax rate on all that money is lower than that of his underlings.
At a June 25, 2007 event supporting Edwards' presidential rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Buffett pulled out paperwork and told the crowd it was wrong that he pays a lower rate than his subordinates.
On his $46.9-million income for 2006, he said, he paid a 17.7 percent tax rate. His secretary and other staffers had a tax rate that was 32.9 percent on average, Buffett told the crowd.
The difference is because of the way the Internal Revenue Service treats different types of income. Most of Buffett's income is from investments such as dividend payments and capital gains on sales of assets, which are taxed at 15 percent.
Taxes on capital gains and dividends are lower because corporate profits already are taxed at 35 percent by federal law. Some critics say any tax on individuals for capital gains and dividends amounts to double taxations that hurts the economy.
Buffett's employees may end up paying at a higher tax rate because standard, earned income, which is the bulk of their income, is taxed at progressively higher brackets up to 35 percent.
Edwards borrowed the Buffett moment at the Clinton event to bolster his argument that the capital gains tax rate is too low. Edwards wants the capital gains rate raised back to 28 percent for people earning more than $200,000, its level before President Bush won lower tax rates.",1,John Edwards
"An all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed. Internet conspiracy theorists have claimed the deadly pedestrian bridge collapse at Florida International University, which killed six, was a consequence of having women lead its construction.
A video blogger with the handle Wife With A Purpose titled her 30-minute YouTube video ""Florida Bridge Collapse, All Female Company."" The video is based on an article from the website Squawker that suggests a high number of female employees doomed the construction project to failure.
The two companies involved in the construction were FIGG Bridge Group and Munilla Construction Management, though bloggers have focused on MCM as the key culprit. (But as our friends at Snopes point out, this choice is a somewhat ironic considering FIGG’s CEO is a woman.)
A visit to MCM’s homepage clearly shows the company is not staffed exclusively by women — not by a long shot. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman.
According to MCM’s website, the company is fully owned and managed by five brothers: Raul Munilla, Juan Munilla, Jorge Munilla, Lou Munilla, Fernando Munilla and Pedro Munilla (seen below, from left to right).
As for MCM’s vice president? Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men, too.
""Although the company has several women in very responsible roles, the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families,"" said Donald Silver, a spokesman for MCM. ""It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful.""
To bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers, the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater, Florida International University.
Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU, was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIU’s website about the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge.
""It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build, too,"" Flores told FIU in an article that ran March 3, less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse.
The Squawker article pointed to Flores’ quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior-ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety. The Squawker article characterizes Flores’ quote as follows:
""Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters.""
But let’s set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores’ quote. An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that ""Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity.""
Silver, the MCM spokesman, confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project.",0,Bloggers
"Says of Donald Trump, ""He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms."" Hillary Clinton says that as president, she would ""tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America,"" while her opponent Donald Trump would ""do nothing.""
At a rally in Cincinnati eight days before Election Day, Clinton explained how she and Trump differ on the issue of guns. The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and ""in return"" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said.
""He’s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,"" Clinton said. ""How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?""
We wondered if Trump really has said he’d put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list.
Throughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office.
""I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and — you have to — and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont . ""On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.""
The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later.
""I’m going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I’m also going to do it in schools,"" he said, adding that he would try to ""work with the states"" or ""perhaps override the states if I have to.""
The topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA’s endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus.
In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, ""We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them.""
On May 21, Trump tweeted : ""Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!""
He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn’t advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom.
""I don’t want to have guns in classrooms,"" he said. ""Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what’s going on. But I’m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.""
We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment.
One final note: It’s highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well.",1,Hillary Clinton
"When oil and gas prices sent state revenues up, Palin sent ""a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska."" John McCain chose Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska, as his running mate for the 2008 election.
Palin joined the ticket at an event in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29, 2008, delivering a speech discussing her biography and qualifications to be vice president.
When she entered public office, she said her goals were ""to stop wasteful spending, and cut property taxes, and put the people first.""
""When oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase, I sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska,"" Palin said of her accomplishments as governor.
We looked into the record and found that Palin did push for a measure to return state surplus revenue back to residents of mineral-rich Alaska. On Aug. 7, 2008, the Alaska Legislature approved a measure she promoted that would send $1,200 to every Alaskan who qualifies.
That comes to about $741-million for state residents, out of an estimated $2.7-billion in increased oil taxes and royalties.
Purists might argue that the rebates only come to 35 percent of the estimated excess revenue. But still, it seems fair to us to describe a $741-million outlay as ""large,"" and $1,200 per person is a nice windfall.",1,Sarah Palin
"""In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier.""

""In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier,"" he said.
He is suggesting Sen. Hillary Clinton's strong reelection showing in Republican-leaning counties in 2006 means she can win nationwide, a key question facing her candidacy.
It is true that she carried 58 out of 62 New York counties, and that President George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years before.
In the interview, the former president delved further into the numbers from the 2006 race, in which she beat Republican John Spencer by more than 2 to 1.  ""In the counties that President Bush won, she got a reelection margin of about 60 percent, which means some -- a lot of Republicans and conservative independents voted for her, because they know her now, and they like her, and they saw her in action working for them,"" he said.
That's not far off the mark from what pollsters say about the reasons for Hillary Clinton's strong showing in her 2006 reelection. Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, says she gained 18 percentage points among independent voters from 2000 to 2006 -- even better than her 15-point gain among moderates.
But he and others also attribute the increase to the fact that Mrs. Clinton was a well-known incumbent with a weak Republican challenger. And she also had the advantage of a national wave, fueled by the unpopularity of President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, that propelled Democrats nationwide in 2006 and helped them regain control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.
Mrs. Clinton may not be able to count on moving independents elsewhere. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 47-percent of independents nationally view her unfavorably.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Hillary Clinton ""wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent."" It’s an old political motto: A good offense is good defense. So to defend Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton’s policies.
On NBC’s Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump’s policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity.
When Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton’s Syria policy.
""Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent,"" Pence said. ""Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program.""
Pence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria.
We wanted to look at Pence’s claim that Clinton’s policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now.
Syrian refugees by the numbers
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million.
Many of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement.
President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for  fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release.
""We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded,"" said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States.
The agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement.
In September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be ""looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.""
That 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported.
It’s important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it’s possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date.

Buzz Aldrin, the 88-year-old astronaut who became the second man to walk on the Moon in 1969, made the news in recent days -- but not of his own volition. A story about Aldrin witnessing space aliens went viral.
The headline on hidden-mag.com ’s post was, ""Buzz Aldrin ‘passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life.’""
The post went on to say that Aldrin and other astronauts -- Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper -- ""gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions."" Specifically, the post said, the four ""took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio.""
One problem with the story: Cooper died in 2004, while Mitchell died in 2016. Worden is 86.
Another problem with the post: It said that Aldrin had said ""he was a spaceship on his way to the Moon,"" the post said, when he saw ""something out there that was close enough to be observed … sort of L-shaped."" According to the post, Aldrin passed a test akin to a lie detector, only ""more reliable.""
That’s an incomplete and misleading snippet from a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he took part in three years ago. Here’s the full comment .
""On Apollo 11 (en) route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world -- it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ‘unidentified.’
""We well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that I had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.
""But the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light years away.""
Bottom line: In the Reddit session, Aldrin clearly rejected any suggestion that the light he saw was some sort of of space alien.
A representative for Aldrin told PolitiFact that the lie-detector angle is bogus as well.
""We don’t know where this new UFO story came from,"" said Christina Korp, vice president of marketing, media and business development for Aldrin. ""Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO.""
Referring to the light he mentioned in the Reddit session, Korp said, ""Buzz has been very clear on this over the years and has never wavered in his description of it. He does not believe in UFOs. ... This is not the first time someone has tried to capitalize on using Buzz’s name to make headlines.""
The Aldrin story appears to have originated with an April 8 ""exclusive"" article in the Daily Star, a site based in the United Kingdom.",0,Bloggers
"""Senator Obama has, in fact, never had a serious Republican challenger."" Trying to cast Sen. Barack Obama as untested in general elections, Sen. Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn asserted during a Feb. 11 conference call with reporters that the first-term Illinois senator has ""never had a serious Republican challenger.""
Critics have frequently tried to hang the ""short on experience"" rap on Obama, but in this instance, Penn is correct.
Obama's toughest battles at the state and national level have been in Democratic primaries. As a community organizer and civil rights lawyer on Chicago's South Side, Obama won his first political race in 1996 by successfully challenging the nominating petitions of four primary rivals in the overwhelmingly Democratic 13th Senate district. He faced no Republican opposition.
In 2000, Obama made his first run for Congress by challenging incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush in a primary but got trounced, finishing with just 31 percent of the vote, compared to Rush's 61 percent.
Four years later, Obama found himself on an unexpectedly easy path to the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Peter G. Fitzgerald. First, Republican multimillionaire front-runner Jack Ryan dropped out of the race amid allegations he pressured his wife to go to sex clubs. The GOP, desparate for a quick replacement, turned to social conservative Alan L. Keyes, who moved from Maryland to Illinois for the race.
Obama wound up capturing 70 percent of the vote, buoyed by the national exposure he received from delivering the keynote speech for presidential nominee John Kerry at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.
Because Obama has faced only token Republican opposition, when he's faced any at all, we deem this claim to be True.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Breaking: federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump."" A misleading viral headline on Facebook suggests that a judge has given the thumbs-up for President Donald Trump to face a subpoena in a case related to his private businesses.
""Breaking: federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump,"" stated a Nov. 29 headline on news.groopspeak.com.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While the headline is wrong, it is based on an actual ruling by a judge. We sent a message to the website but did not get a reply.
The article linked to a Nov. 29 article in the Washington Post about a federal judge’s ruling in a lawsuit brought by two Democratic attorneys general against Trump. The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution because he benefits financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties.
The emoluments clause of the Constitution says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress.
On Nov. 28, U.S. District Court Judge Peter J. Messitte ruled that that D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can serve subpoenas requiring Trump-owned companies to preserve documents.
The Post described the decision as ""a small advancement"" in the case.
We read Messitte’s two-paragraph decision and saw nothing that addressed Trump himself being subpoenaed. Here is the main part:
""It is hereby ordered that the parties shall be permitted to serve subpoenas on third-parties for the sole purpose of preservation of documents,"" the judge wrote.
We asked a spokeswoman for the Maryland attorney general if the ruling stated that the plaintiffs could subpoena Trump.
""No, it only relates to preservation of documents,"" Raquel Coombs said.
Robert Marus, a spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General, told PolitiFact that the ruling allows the plaintiffs to serve document preservation subpoenas on the Trump-owned companies in preparation for moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit against President Trump.
""Those entities are not parties to this litigation, which means they would not normally be required to preserve documents. However, their records may be relevant to the case, which is why we asked the court for special permission to subpoena them to preserve these documents,"" Marus wrote.
Parties to litigation -- in this case Trump in his official capacity -- do not have to be subpoenaed to preserve documents, Marus said.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department pointed to a court document filed on behalf of Trump in which the defendant argued that while a motion to dismiss is pending there shouldn’t be any discovery.
For the record, a sitting president can be subpoenaed, said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.
""Richard Nixon had documents subpoenaed, and the Supreme Court upheld this,"" he told PolitiFact.
A headline stated that a ""federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump."" A federal judge made a ruling about the preservation of documents in a case, but the subpoenas pertain to third-parties, not Trump individually.",0,news.groopspeak.com
"""America is No. 1 one in oil and gas."" The United States is on top of the world in terms of energy production, President Barack Obama said during his sixth State of the Union.
""We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet,"" he said during his Jan. 20 address. ""And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.""
We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we’ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration , which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain.
By this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production.
If we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of ""oil production"" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
A note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It’s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings.
The United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.
Here is a chart showing the breakdown:
The United States and Russia are the top producers of natural gas -- with the United States producing 29.5 trillion cubic feet in 2012, and Russia producing 23 trillion.
Oil production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices.
The majority of U.S. oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D.; Eagle Ford, Texas; the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest states; and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all U.S. crude oil production.
In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing , or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production.
There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared with Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market.
""In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,"" Maugeri said.",1,Barack Obama
"""Heroin .. pours across our southern borders."" In the third and final presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump blamed President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for many of the problems faced by people in New Hampshire. Trump said that included drug addiction.
""The single-biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders, just pouring, and destroying their youth and is poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people,"" Trump said.
We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border?
Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.
""Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand,"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 .
""Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States,"" the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. ""Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons.""
Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border:
As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades.
In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves.
Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact in September.
This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico.
From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer.
In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer.
""The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends,"" he said.
Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast.",1,Donald Trump
"""Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies."" A story on Facebook celebrates President Donald Trump’s approval rating and boasts that it is better than two of his predecessors, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan.
""Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies,"" said a June 9 headline on The Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump website.
The story said that Trump’s approval rating is at 45 percent, which it claims is nearly equal to Obama and Reagan at the same point of their presidences.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
Is it true? We looked at the polls cited in the story as well as additional polls to provide a more complete picture.
We found that The Gateway Pundit cited the early June polls that were the most favorable to Trump: a Fox News poll showed that 45 percent of respondents approved of Trump while Rasmussen Reports showed 47 percent approval for Trump.
A compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics in early June showed that five other polls, including Gallup, all had slightly less favorable results for Trump.
For Obama, The Gateway Pundit cited a Rasmussen poll that showed Obama’s approval was at 46 percent on June 9, 2010. Some experts have raised questions about Rasmussen’s polls, because they are based on likely voters, which is a smaller sample than most other polls; historically, Rasmussen has tended to report more favorable results for Republicans generally and Trump in particular. So we looked at one other poll from the same time, Gallup , and also found Obama had the same approval rating.
We also found the comparison between Trump, Obama and Reagan in a story about a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal . The story said that Trump’s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010) ""before both presidents saw their parties lose a significant number of House seats in the midterms."" Historically, the president’s party usually gets shellacked during the midterms .
The Gateway Pundit did not cite this NBC/WSJ poll, which has some warning signs for Republicans in general, including that Democrats were far more enthusiastic than Republicans about the upcoming midterms. Also, 48 percent of voters indicate they’re more likely to support a congressional candidate who promises to provide a check on President Trump, compared with 23 percent who say they’re less likely to support such a candidate.
Karlyn Bowman, a polling specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned against drawing conclusions about what the polls in early June mean for the midterm election in November.
""Although polls have more predictive value as we get closer to Election Day, we are still more than 100 days out,"" she said.
Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said that there is considerable variation in presidential job approval ratings across survey organizations. These differences are due to variation in sampling frames, question wordings, weighting, and other factors.
""Consequently, claims like the Gateway Pundit claim that depend on differences of a few percentage points using different survey organizations’ findings are questionable. The comparisons simply are not reliable,"" he said.",1,The Gateway Pundit
"""Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S."" Fake Internet posts said President Donald Trump offered to give refuge to Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses after that country banned followers of the religion, but there is no record he made any such comments.
""Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.,"" reads the headline on an undated story on States-TV.com. The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, HoustonChronicle-TV.com and Fox-News24.com .
Facebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds.
The post is keyed to a real event: Russia’s Supreme Court banned the religious organization on April 20, labeling the group as a danger for ""extremist activities."" The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned.
From there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move ""is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation.""
""I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you,"" Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah’s Witness could find freedom in this country.
""As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated,"" he said, according to the post.
The problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn’t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all.
We reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn’t receive a response.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner did release a statement on April 20 saying that the United States was ""extremely concerned by the Russian government's actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah's Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism.""
Toner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society.
""All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation's constitution,"" he said.
But there’s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn’t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country’s 175,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses being harassed by Russian police since the ruling.
Fox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper’s name but doesn’t look to have affiliation.
All three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites.
But even though this story appears to be bogus, it’s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles.
Fox-News24.com, for example, features one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying she wouldn’t mind shutting down the Education Department. It’s copied practically word-for-word from a Feb. 17 story from U.S. News & World Report.
Fox-News24.com administrators have hidden the registration of the website, which was only registered on March 20. There is no contact information available. The same goes for the other two websites we’ve noted .
The story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah’s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America. The State Department did decry Russia’s ruling, but there’s no evidence Trump weighed in.",0,Bloggers
"Children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt. On Sept. 21, 2010, a group called Citizens for the Republic unveiled a television ad called ""Mourning in America,"" that mirrored, right down to its understated visuals and narration, a famous Ronald Reagan ad from his 1984 re-election campaign titled ""Morning in America."" Whereas the original ad exuded confidence and pride in the United States under Reagan's leadership, the new version -- aired by a group run by veterans of the Reagan administration -- presented a bleak look at the current state of the economy and a tone of sadness about the country's seemingly diminished prospects.
""There's mourning in America,"" the ad begins. ""Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work. Businesses shuttered. Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall. This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt.""
We won't judge whether these statistics support the idea that the country is ""fading,"" that President Barack Obama's policy has ""failed"" or the ad's exhortation to vote for a ""smaller, more caring government."" But we will look at each of the statistics mentioned in the ad. (The ad was put together by Fred Davis, a leading Republican ad-man. We discuss some of the ads he made this year in a story posted today .)
• ""Fifteen million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work."" According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, there were 14.9 million unemployed Americans in August. Close enough for us.
• ""Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall."" According to RealtyTrac , the leading authority on foreclosure statistics, ""lenders foreclosed on 95,364 U.S. properties in August (2010), the highest monthly total in the history of the report."" If you divide that total by 31 days, you get 3,076 foreclosures per day. That's actually a little more than the ad indicates.
• ""This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married."" This statistic was presumably included so the current ad would mirror the script of the one from 1984, which cited the then-rate of 6,500 marriages per day as evidence that couples were heading optimistically into the future. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, though it's not clear how much of this is due to economic conditions, as opposed to broader social and demographic trends.
The most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, show that there were 2,077,000 marriages in 2009. Dividing this total by 365 days, you get 5,690 marriages per day. That's a little lower than what the ad says -- by about 5 percent. Also, those who are really picky may quibble that the number of marriages completed on weekdays is a lot lower than 6,000, and it's a lot higher on weekend days. Still, the ad is pretty close.
• Each child born will have ""a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt."" At first, we were confused by this statistic because our reading of the ad's wording suggested that it should involve how many children were going to be born to couples who got married this year. But it turns out this statistic is much simpler than that. The ad writers divided the total estimate for the public debt at the end of 2010 ($9,297,653,000,000) by the total U.S. population (307,006,550) and came out with $30,286 for every man, woman and child.
In a recent item , we discussed the relative merits of two different measures for the national debt. One is debt held by the public (which the makers of ""Mourning in America"" used, and the other is that amount plus debt held by the government, typically in trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When we asked economists for their opinion of which measurement is more relevant, each of the two statistics had its fans, so we concluded that both are legitimate measurements. For completeness, we'll note here that using the larger figure, called gross federal debt, the per-person debt load would be just shy of $45,000, which would only make the ad's argument stronger.
Put it all together and you have four statistics that are all very, very close to being accurate.",1,Citizens for the Republic
"""Breaking: Crew of Air Force One Refuses to Fly Obama 6000 miles ‘Just to Play Golf’ "" The claims circulated on social media that Air Force One won’t transport the Obamas for vacation are flights of fancy.
The website BuzzFeedUSA.com, which appears to be registered to an address in Macedonia and has no connection to the real BuzzFeed.com, posted an article on Dec. 20 with the headline, ""Breaking: Crew of Air Force One Refuses to Fly Obama 6000 miles ‘Just to Play Golf.’ ""
The article states that the captain of the fleet had enough with the Obamas’ frivolous flights and wouldn’t take the president to Hawaii ""just for the day"" to play a round of golf with a friend.
This is not true.
The Obamas set out for their annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii — Barack Obama’s birthplace — the evening of Dec. 16, four days before the article posted. Here’s video of them departing on Air Force One that night.
Per White House pool reports, Obama played rounds of golf on Dec. 17, 19, 21 and 23. The First Family has also spent time at the beach, walked a nature trail at a botanical garden, played escape the room and dined at a popular Japanese restaurant — all in Hawaii. On Christmas Day, the President and First Lady visited troops at a marine base, again in Hawaii.
Several of the other claims made in the article are entirely fabricated. The Obamas never took Air Force One to Chicago for White Castle burgers. There is no Air Force Osprey specifically to transport the First Dog. (Here’s an article describing Bo walking up and down the aisle of Air Force One.)
The article’s assertion that Air Force One is not obligated to fly anywhere ""unless it was on official business"" lacks critical context. Vacation trips fall under the official travel category as the president and vice president are assumed to be always on duty, according to the Congressional Research Service .
The article also includes a picture of the First Family’s dog, Bo, departing a marine helicopter. As our friends at Snopes point out , the image was taken in 2013 during the Obamas’ vacation on the Martha’s Vineyard.

After the photo, the article then concludes with a wink:
""It’s a fairly well-known fact that after about 150 words and a picture that may or may not be related, most conservative readers will stop reading and go comment that the Muslim should be executed for playing golf. Therefore, less than 20% of those who clicked this article will have made it this far.""
While BuzzFeedUSA.com’s article fetched no comments, many who read the same article posted on a different fake news site seem to have missed this disclaimer and praised the dissident pilot.

"China is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites."" The 2016 presidential campaign has inspired discussion of plenty of scary foreign-policy scenarios, from ISIS attacks to cyber warfare. But at a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio offered one we hadn’t heard much about – the possibility that China could blow an American satellite out of the sky.
China, Rubio said, is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites.""
Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. ""Regrettably true,"" Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim.
Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. ""And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft,"" as Popular Mechanics magazine put it .
China’s destruction of its own missile inspired ""a great deal of international rebuke,"" said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to  Scientific American .
The technology China used, known as ""hit-to-kill,"" doesn’t technically ""blow up"" the satellite, as Rubio had said. No explosives are involved, only the force of impact of a missile-launched ""kill vehicle.""
""This is the same technology that the U.S. missile defense systems are based on,"" Grego said. ""In fact, the U.S. used the Aegis ship-based missile defense system to destroy the USA 193 satellite just over a year after the Chinese test.""
Which brings up a point worth noting: China isn’t the only one playing this game. Russia and the United States have been testing anti-satellite technology since the 1960s .
In fact, when the United States, a year after China destroyed its satellite, destroyed one of its own, cables released by Wikileaks suggest was a mission with military significance.
""Russia and the United States either have experimented with or deployed similar technologies"" as China, said Theresa Hitchens, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. ""Indeed, the Chinese are actually behind both Russia and the United States regarding development of these technologies. Nothing China has tested is anything that the U.S. has not tested before.""
A further complication: Technologies that can be used to destroy satellites can also be used for benign purposes. Ballistic missiles can destroy satellites – or they can be used legitimately for missile defense. And satellites themselves can be maneuvered to damage or destroy nearby satellites – or they can be maneuvered for repair or refueling, Hitchens said. This is known as ""dual-use"" technology.
This makes it hard to discern motives. In fact, China has ""officially said its tests are not aimed at any other country, and it has been a longtime proponent of trying to manage this issue using space arms control,"" Grego said.
But it’s difficult to prove a purely defensive motive when dealing with such dual-use technologies, Hitchens said.
""We see them doing dual-use experiments and assume it’s for nefarious purposes, and they see us doing dual-use experiments and assume nefarious purposes,"" she said. This kind of thinking can produce an arms race.
Still, experts said it was fair for Rubio to point out China’s development of technologies that can be used to attack satellites, since it’s a threat to national security even if we’re working on much the same thing.

Under questioning from Stewart, Obama came back to a familiar theme: When he took office, he inherited a mess.
""We lost 4 million jobs before I was sworn in; 750,000 the month I was sworn in; 600,000, the month after that; 600,000 the month after that. So most of the jobs that we lost were lost before the economic policies we put in place had any effect.""
Candidates have sparred endlessly over who deserves the blame for the nation’s high unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent in the latest tally. After the Daily Show interview, one of our readers asked us to check Obama's numbers. So we decided to take a look.
Obama didn't give a time frame for the 4 million lost jobs other than to say the losses occurred before he took office. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics , official keeper of the jobs statistics, to see if the numbers matched up in some way.
We found a match: Looking at BLS data on seasonally adjusted non-farm employment from December 2007, when the recession officially began, to January 2009, the month before the stimulus was enacted (a 13-month period), the jobs number declined by 4.4 million. So Obama’s first number was right, although he could have been clearer about the time frame.
When he refers to his economic policies, we presume he is referring to his main economic stimulus, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It passed in February 2009, but it took several months before the impact of its spending was felt in the economy.
Job loss didn’t stop, but Obama is right that it slowed down. In the 19 months from February 2009 through September 2010, the month of the most recent preliminary data, the overall job decline in the private and public sectors was 2.6 million. And the number of jobs lost per month has declined from around 700,000 a month at the beginning of the administration to months in which there were small net gains. Since May, however, the losses -- albeit smaller ones -- have returned, giving Republicans fresh ammunition. For example, payroll employment dropped 57,000 between July and August 2010.
""I watched the president on Stewart’s show last night, and I thought his basic point about the timing of the employment losses was correct and ought to be noncontroversial,"" Gary Burtless, a labor markets expert at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said in an e-mail.
There's still plenty to debate about the stimulus and its impact on the economy, and the recent reversal of job gains is troubling.",1,Barack Obama
"In Parkland, Fla. ""the mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."" A conservative website portrayed Nikolas Cruz, who admitted to fatally gunning down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as sharing views of certain Muslims and leftists.
""The mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate,"" stated a story on the Geller Report website on Feb. 14, the day of the shooting at the Parkland, Fla., school.
The author of the website, Pamela Geller , is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a far-right group.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate.
Most of Geller’s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz’s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase ""Group Therapy.""
Geller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz’s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase ""Allahu Akbar."" The phrase , which means ""God is greater,"" is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks.
Cruz’s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that ""at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar.'""
We sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim.
""He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people,"" she told PunditFact in an email.
Geller said that Cruz’s interest in the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" ""doesn't mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it.""
Law enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past.
Cruz had regularly gotten in trouble at school at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of mental illness , and police had been called to his home. Cruz’s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child.
Ocean Parodie, 17, told The Daily Beast that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that ""seemed really extreme, like hating on"" Islam and would also deride Muslims as ""terrorists and bombers.""
In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as ""off,"" ""weird"" and ""crazy"" to describe him to journalists.
Some initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but law enforcement said they didn’t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have spread misinformation to media outlets .
We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office to ask some questions about Cruz’s Instagram account but not did get a reply.
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with Local 10 ABC’s Michael Putney .
When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: ""Because he is an evil killer.""
The Geller Report described Cruz as being ""immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."" Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns. A mocking Instagram post attributed to him showed he Googled the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" but that doesn’t prove that he was immersed in Islamic and left-wing hate. We found no evidence to support Geller’s claim.",0,Pamela Geller
"Says ""2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash"" in a nearby county. A fake news website looking to spread malware lured readers by altering details of a tragically true news story of a fatal car wreck that killed two women and several children.
At least 22 posts we first noticed on April 10, 2017, on the website CountyNewsroom.info carried headlines that declared, ""2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash,"" followed by the name of a county, such as Stark County or Schuyler County.
Facebook users flagged multiple versions of the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news in user feeds.
The story is fake, although it does steal details from a real event (more on that in a second). The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used.
When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won’t be linking to any of the stories for that reason.
The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as ""Police."" The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it’s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not.
There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia. The small country in the Caucasus has been a growing source of multiple fake news websites since the 2016 presidential campaign.
We emailed the person listed in the WHOIS lookup, but have not heard back.
The story, meanwhile, gives no indication in which state it is located, but the details of the accident are identical in each version. Two men — Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47 — were the sole survivors of a crash that killed their families, the posts said.
According to the story, the two men were in a minivan with their families when the minivan hit a black BMW on the side of the road. The minivan was then struck from behind by ""a big rig,"" sending the minivan toppling into a ravine.
The minivan caught fire, the story read, and the two men managed to escape. Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities.
""Words can’t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene,"" a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. ""It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly.""
The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said.
While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif . Some, but not all, of the details were changed.
Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post. Their wives and four children, not five, were trapped in their minivan and killed in the fiery wreck. The children were aged 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the two men did suffer burns trying to save their families.
The quote is unaltered, and came from a California Highway Patrol officer named Dan Williams. Another CHP officer also is quoted in some true reporting of the incident .
The author of the post made minimal changes to real news stories about the accident, using the shocking specifics to fool readers into clicking.

"Says Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death. Here’s a scary story. A mother in Mexico thinks that her 2-year-old has a cold and puts Vicks VapoRub on his chest and under his nose. She lies down next to him and when she wakes, she finds the child dead.
The tale began moving through the Web in November. Smag31.com , a website that targets young mothers, carried it on Nov. 25 with the headline, ""Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies.""
But so far as anyone can tell, the story is untrue. Vicks VapoRub has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, but not to any deaths. The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news.
Bruce Rubin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. In 2009 , he published a peer-reviewed article based on a case he had encountered a few years before. The parents of an 18-month-old had put Vicks under the child’s nose and the child immediately stopped breathing. They quickly turned the child upside down, slapped it on the back and it coughed up a plug of mucus. Its breathing returned to normal.
But Rubin told us that in the 10 years since that case, he’s seen no report of any deaths. On the other hand, episodes of breathing distress while rare, are not unheard of.
""I understand that there have been about 30 such reports, all with Vicks under the nose of very small children,"" Rubin said. ""Procter and Gamble (the maker of Vicks) specifically states never to use this directly under the nose at any age, and never use at all in children under the age of 2.""
To underscore, that is what the label says. Never under the nose. Never with kids under 2.
A 2012 study looked at what happens when menthol, one of Vicks’ active ingredients, is inhaled. It found that the body responds by making more mucus, but again, the authors cited no example of a child actually dying.
Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ environmental health council, said, ""I have never heard, nor could I find a report of, a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub.""
Lowry said as a pediatric medical toxicologist, she has concerns about any product that contains camphor, as Vicks does. But her main worry is that parents will do exactly the wrong thing and have kids eat it. That’s very dangerous.
Procter and Gamble spokeswoman Velvet Gogol Bennett said the company has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling Vicks VapoRub.
""We have had no local health authority notification, no hospital notification, nor any doctor or any official news organization anywhere in the world has brought this case to our attention,"" Bennett said. ""Despite all of our efforts to investigate this social media posting, there is no verifiable information in terms of city and name of the person concerned.""
The blog post about the alleged death said, ""The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.""
If such a medical report exists, no researcher we contacted seems to have ever seen it.
We reached out to the author behind the blog and did not hear back.
The myth-busting website Snopes also looked into this and found it lacked substance. A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products. Those situations sent children to the emergency room, but were not fatal. The one exception was in 1983 involving a child with pneumonia whose parents had given him a home remedy that contained camphor and alcohol.
Rubin said if people follow instructions, Vicks is fine: ""If you are an adult with a stuffy head cold, putting Vicks on your chest and drinking some hot tea with honey (and perhaps rum) is as good a medicine as it gets. Just keep the Vicks (and the rum) away from the under-2 crowd.""",0,Bloggers
"""National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days"" A website called Viral WDC said the deployment of the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border allowed immigration officials to arrest ""1,600 extra people"" trying to cross into the United States illegally.
""A major game-changing incident took place after the National Guard stormed the border to protect the immigration laws and defend citizens from having nearly 2,000 people break into America illegally. … Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally,"" said the May 14 post on Viral WDC , headlined ""National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days.""
Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Looking past the bluster of the headline, the story largely checks out.
Government officials have credited National Guard troops at the border for contributing to the apprehension of 1,600 people , the capture of about 1,000 pounds of marijuana and 451 ""turn backs"" of individuals seeking to come into the United States illegally, CNN reported May 9, based on a conference call with CBP and National Guard officials.
The Viral WDC story cites a Washington Examiner story that said, ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border.""
Neither Viral WDC nor the Washington Examiner say what the 1,600 number is in addition to. The way the Viral WDC story is written suggests that 1,600 would not have been apprehended if the National Guard wasn’t assisting. But there’s no evidence to support that.
CNN said a CBP official ""did not have comparison numbers available, so it was not possible to determine if those figures were substantially more than if National Guard troops had not been dispatched to the border.""
Total apprehensions were up in April compared to March, but border apprehensions have been increasing since February. There were about 37,400 southwest border apprehensions in March, compared to approximately 38,300 in April, according to CBP.
President Donald Trump on April 4 issued a memorandum so that the National Guard could help immigration officials stop the illegal entry of immigrants and illicit drugs.
It’s important to note that the National Guard is not actually apprehending individuals. Instead, they are carrying out non-enforcement roles , serving as pilots, aerial observers, intelligence analysts, communications specialists, camera operators and vehicle mechanics.
Defense Secretary James N. Mattis authorized the use of Defense Department funds to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to the southern border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He authorized the deployment through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2018.
The troops are deployed under Title 32 duty status, meaning they are under the command and control of their state governors but paid by the federal government and can undertake ""Homeland Defense activities.""
There are now more than 1,800 National Guard troops who deployed starting in early April, U.S. Customs and Border protection spokesman Daniel Hetlage told PolitiFact on June 6.",1,Bloggers
"""Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."" The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long and intertwined history .
While the Marines are considered a separate branch of the military, and while the Commandant of the Marine Corps is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine commandant formally answers to the Secretary of the Navy, and the corps has been considered part of the Department of the Navy since 1834 . The United States Naval Academy commissions officers for both.
So it would be a pretty big deal if President Donald Trump acted to officially separate the two military branches from each other.
That’s what a widely shared item on the website Vet TV said. Is it true?
The short answer: No. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds.
An article on the website is headlined, ""Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."" The article claims, ""President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy. The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare.""
Setting aside the tiny likelihood that the administration knows in detail what executive orders Trump will be signing on a specific date six months down the road, there is no evidence to support the notion that he will be splitting the two branches.
""We have not heard anything about that. Semper Fidelis,"" said Marine Capt. Ryan Elizabeth Alvis, a public-affairs official at the Marine Corps headquarters.
The Navy referred PolitiFact to the office of the Secretary of Defense, which referred us to the White House. The White House declined to comment on the record.
As it happens, there may be an explanation for why the article ran. Vet TV bills itself as an entertainment and humor site for veterans -- though it would be hard to know that from the web page in question.
All the way down at the bottom of the article , past the lengthy reader comment section, is this description of Vet TV: ""The first television network created by and for post 9/11 veterans without civilian influence. Hollywood wouldn't make this for us, so we did it ourselves. Get ready to laugh at everything the DoD leadership doesn't want you to laugh at. This network is sure to offend p------, liberals, and probably our parents.""
Vet TV was founded by Donny O’Malley , a humorist and YouTube celebrity. According to his bio, O’Malley was a Marine infantry officer for almost six years, serving in Asia and Afghanistan and reaching the rank of captain.
Vet TV was launched as a Kickstarter campaign , setting a goal of $250,000 and securing a total of $296,331 from 3,609 donors. The idea is to create a app and a website for irreverent videos that can be streamed across all devices. ""Imagine the ‘Netflix of the military,’ but with all original content,"" as O’Malley describes it. The project is set to launch later this month and dubs itself ""the Comedy Central of the military.""
However, the article about the Navy-Marines split does not include a prominent ""satire"" label, and much of the text of the article itself rather mundane. As a result, it would be easy for social media users to think that word of the inter-branch split was legitimate news.
With the Navy-Marines article, ""the first part of the piece isn’t very humorous at all,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Only deeper in the article does the satire become more obvious, he said, such as this passage: "" ‘The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia,’ Sgt. Major Garrett explained.""
Janda said that the article does draw on a deep well of competition, and even tension, between the two branches.
""The U.S. Marines were modeled on the Royal Marines in the same way that the early U.S. Navy modeled itself on the Royal Navy,"" he said. ""Marines served on every ship, just like today. They fought as sharp-shooters or with bayonets in ship-to-ship encounters, made up landing parties, guarded the captain, and enforced discipline when needed. In mutinous situations they almost always stayed loyal to the captain, and for that reason, and because they enforced ship discipline such as executions and floggings, they were usually hated by sailors. Some of that mutual enmity, driven by rivalry and respect, endures today.""
O’Malley did not reply to an inquiry sent through his website.",0,Vet TV
"""Just in: 45 states just banned Sharia law"" A story appearing on Facebook repeated talk of Donald Trump’s 2015 proposed ban on Muslim immigrants but went too far in including a claim that the majority of U.S. states have banned Sharia law.
""Just in: 45 states just banned Sharia law,"" said a Feb. 6 headline on viralusa.org.
Similar fake stories have circulated for months on various websites proclaiming that many states, or Trump himself , banned Sharia law.
Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, and financial dealings.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the majority of states have not imposed such a ban. While the headline is a hoax meant to drive page views, some of the quotes in the article related to Trump’s proposed ban are accurate.
We have been tracking Trump’s promise ""for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims"" entering the U.S. and rated his efforts, which have been bogged down in litigation, Stalled .
The viralusa.org story that followed the headline makes no mention of states banning Sharia law. Instead, the brief story focused on Trump’s effort to ban Muslims.
The story repeated a quote by Trump about the Muslim ban:
""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,"" he said.
The story on viralusa.org didn’t explain the setting when Trump made that quote: he said it at a rally in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Dec. 7, 2015 pointing to a statement he made earlier that day.
Viralusa.org then posted the response by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. who said on CNN ""you know how you make American great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.""
The story also quoted a reply from Ben Carson : ""We do not discriminate on people based on religion"" -- again, a real quote from CNN.
(Graham and Carson were among Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary at the time.)
While the vast majority of states haven’t banned Sharia law, 11 states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington -- enacted legislation regarding the application of foreign or religious law in state courts in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
These state laws generally ban the application of foreign laws if it violates a person’s fundamental rights such as freedom of religion or speech.
Additionally, Texas adopted a law that requires the Texas Supreme Court to adopt rules and provide judicial instruction regarding the application of foreign laws in certain family law cases.
Though most of the laws don’t expressly ban Sharia law, critics say that they could be viewed as anti-Muslim.
In reality the practice of using foreign law in state courts is not uncommon and generally not controversial, experts told PolitiFact Florida in 2014. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements.
A headline said that ""45 states just banned Sharia law,"" but the story itself contained no information about any such state bans. While there have been some states that have enacted legislation to ban the use of foreign law, at least in some circumstances, it’s a gross exaggeration to say that the majority of states have banned Sharia law.",0,Bloggers
"""Thirty-four percent of Hispanics don't have any health care at all, don't have any health insurance.""

The report cites 2005 estimates by the Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.

"Says Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst ""promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA."" A new ad from a coalition of environmental groups tries to paint Iowa’s Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst as too extreme. The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second TV spot on June 23, 2014.
The ad raises concern over Ernst’s promises ""to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.""  It claims that these promises are ""why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington."" All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is ""Too extreme for Iowa.""
It’s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate’s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency?
Our research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April.
Will she do away with the Education Department?
Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She’s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley.
Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014.
One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation’s ""crumbling road and transportation systems."" Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds.
""I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government,"" Ernst said . She called for ""closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it’s coming from the state.""
We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is ""about state-driven policy,"" Hamel said.
According to the Education Department’s website the ""federal role in education is limited."" States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, at the federal level , the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants.
The ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to federal numbers , that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn’t get a response.
What about the EPA?
While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. ""Let’s shut down the EPA,"" she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, ""The state knows best how to protect resources.""
So, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA.
Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa’s key industries , and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst’s spokeswoman, said that ""Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions.""
The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA.
Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry.
""Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years,""  said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. ""Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA’s responsibilities, many — probably most — do not.""",1,League of Conservation Voters
"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held for about five years by the Taliban after disappearing in Afghanistan, has taken off again -- this time during his own court proceeding, says Duffel Blog.
""Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial,"" said the October headline in Duffel Blog .
Here’s the accurate backstory: Bergdahl walked off his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban. The military searched for him, and officers were injured in the process. Bergdahl was freed by his captors in 2014. In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. President Barack Obama’s controversial decision to exchange Bergdahl angered many Republicans, including then-candidate Donald Trump .
The Duffel Blog says that Bergdahl now has walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, prompting a statewide manhunt.
""Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal,"" states the article.
He left behind a note, the blog says:
""Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others. I am ashamed to even be an American (deserter).""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story is fake.
The article then becomes more ridiculous. It says that a few military personnel were injured in the manhunt and that ""ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified.""
The Pentagon offered a reward for information about Bergdahl’s whereabouts: ""$25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information.""
""Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years,"" states the blog.
The article linked to an Oct. 12 Washington Post  story previewing an upcoming hearing for Bergdahl.
Multiple news outlets including the AP reported that Bergdahl entered a plea of guilty during the Oct. 16 hearing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He didn’t wander off during his hearing.
""I understand that leaving was against the law,"" Bergdahl testified.
On Nov. 3, a military judge ordered that Bergdahl receive a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Army and reduced his rank from sergeant to private.
The Duffel Blog calls itself ""the American military’s Most Trusted news source"" but readers will have to find the disclaimer to learn this is fake news.

"""There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."" With the health care bill teetering in the balance, antiabortion Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak's announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift.
For weeks, Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions, contrary to longstanding federal policy. But on the afternoon of March 21, 2010, Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him ""there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation.""
Stupak's comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late-night health care debate.
""It is the Democrats who, through the president's executive order, ensure that the sanctity of life is protected,"" Stupak said.
His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bill's Republican opponents, one of whom was heard to yell ""baby killer!"" Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted. But he said he yelled ""It's a baby killer,"" referring not to Stupak (to whom he apologized), but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president.
The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start.
From early on, legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill. But that quickly proved difficult, if not impossible. Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military.
But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance?
In the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion ""rider"" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.
The Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions.
The Senate bill's proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue. Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks -- one for abortion services and one for everything else. NARAL called the provision ""unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization (that) could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage, even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women.""
Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bill's abortion language, arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions, that's federal funding of abortion. They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums -- not government subsidies -- nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme.
Until March 21, 2010, that was Stupak's consistent position.
In a Fox News interview on March 17, 2010, Stupak said of the Senate bill, ""It is very clear that abortion is, for the first time ever, a funded benefit by the federal government.""
So, what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say ""there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation""? In the hours leading up to the vote, he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions.
The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that, but Obama's executive order went one step further, putting the president's weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated. By our reading, the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill. But it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions.
That's why some abortion foes -- not all -- believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans.
""It was issued for political effect,"" said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. ""We don't see any value in the order.""
We don't think Rep. Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions, and then the next day, after getting the agreement on the executive order, that it does not. Stupak's issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions, that was federal funding for abortion. And that hasn't changed. The president's order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated. But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before, there's nothing in the executive order that would change your mind.
At the climax of the health care debate from the floor, House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president, the Senate bill would provide ""taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years.""
We don't agree. It's understandable that abortion foes opposed a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions. But it's another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars. The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited. But more than that, the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums, premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion. The executive order puts the weight of the president's word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled.
We think that's enough to back up Stupak's claim, ""There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."" But that's a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order, back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions. We don't understand how the executive order changes Stupak's logic on this issue, but no matter how he arrived as his conclusion, we think he's right now. And we rule his claim True.",1,Bart Stupak
"Says he ""came to the Republican Party sooner in age"" than Ronald Reagan. Texas Gov. Rick Perry wasn’t always a Republican.
His opponents like to remind him of that, as Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann did in a Republican presidential primary debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. And Perry likes to respond that another notable Republican once had a ""D"" behind his name too.
""I, like most people in the state of Texas and those southern states, grew up a Democrat. Michael Reagan and I were talking just the other day, Charlie, that I came to the Republican Party sooner in age than his dad, Ronald Reagan, did,"" Perry told debate moderator Charlie Rose on Oct. 11, 2011.
Perry said something similar to conservative commentator Sean Hannity during a radio appearance in August 2011. His words then, also repeated from a conversation with the former president’s son: ""I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.""
PolitiFact Texas checked it out .
According to biographer Edward Yager, Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""
Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat.
He remained a Democrat even as he supported Republican presidential candidates, according to Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library.
The library’s website says Reagan made the switch and registered Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51.
As for Perry, born March 4, 1950, he won his first three political races for a Texas House seat as a Democrat, then switched parties in 1989 to challenge a Democratic agricultural commissioner. A Texas Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29 of that year in a press conference outside the Texas Capitol.
On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old, 12 years younger than Reagan when he made his switch.",1,Rick Perry
"President Trump greenlighted Congress to ramp up Clinton investigation. A fake news story makes the explosive claim that, on the heels of his inauguration, President Donald Trump personally greenlighted the chairman of a powerful congressional watchdog committee to pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.
The story appears on the website Federalist Tribune alongside a video clip in which Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, recalled Trump speaking in general terms about Chaffetz’s oversight authority during a backstage meeting at the Jan. 26 Republican retreat in Philadelphia.
But at no point does the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee claim that Trump even mentioned Clinton’s name -- much less that Trump urged him to ramp up an investigation into the 2016 Democratic nominee, as the story claims.
The Federalist Tribune story, which has more than 5,000 page views at the time of this writing, is just one of several websites to use the Chaffetz video to advance the unsubstantiated claim that Trump encouraged Congress to aggressively pursue charges against Clinton.
And it’s worth noting that as it stands now, we’ve rated Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton as Stalled.
The fake article opens with the inflammatory allegation that Trump has ""finally given Congress the authorization"" to pursue charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.
It then mischaracterizes Chaffetz’s recollection of his meeting with Trump by claiming Chaffetz’s statement ""hint(s) that charges against Hillary could be happening soon"" -- before promising that ""Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted.""
In truth, the video shows Chaffetz merely recalling how Trump offered him words of encouragement about staying focused on his oversight mission, without mentioning any specific investigations.
Chaffetz recalled Trump telling him, ""‘I understand that I’m the president. But you have a job to do. You do the oversight. You don't slow down. You go after everything you want to go after. You look at anything you want to look at.’""
Chaffetz said Trump’s words at the Philadelphia convention were an inspiring message about how Trump views his committee’s government watchdog role.
""If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight of the government and the function that we fulfill, you’d be pretty inspired,"" Chaffetz said. ""And for him to convey a message of 'Don't slow down, go do your job, there’s a lot to get after with the government,' I think was a good message.""
It’s wrongheaded to extrapolate from Chaffetz’s statement that Trump gave his imprimatur to a ramped-up investigation into Clinton.
Chaffetz’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
For his part, Chaffetz said after the election that Clinton’s defeat would not signal an end to his committee’s investigation of her email practices and handling of classified information while in government.
But there’s no evidence Trump has personally urged him to keep the pressure up.",0,Bloggers
"""Breaking: Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’"" A newly elected mayor in New Jersey has banned the word ""Christmas"" at government functions, prompting an angered man to toss a souffle at his head, a fake news article proclaimed.
""Breaking: Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’"" stated a Dec. 16 headline on the Last Line of Defense , a fake news website that identifies itself as satire.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no such ban on the word ‘Christmas’ by Mayor-elect Ravi Bhalla.
Bhalla, a city council member and lawyer , was elected mayor Nov. 7 out of a field of six candidates. He will be officially sworn in Jan. 1, 2018. The previous mayor, Dawn Zimmer, decided not to run again.
Bhalla will be the first Sikh mayor of Hoboken. During the election, a flier with the phrase ""Don't let TERRORISM take over our town"" above a picture of Bhalla appeared on car windshields.
The Last Line of Defense article stated that Bhalla received a Christmas gift from Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center at 5th and Brussels.
The two politicians shook hands and then ""Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that ""the word ‘Christmas shall not be said at government functions,'"" the article stated.
Apparently that didn’t sit well with one man in the audience, according to the website which used a quote allegedly from the Hoboken Journal.
""The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhalla’s head, knocking his turban off. Eventually, things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening.""
We searched the website of the Hoboken Journal , a blog, and found no such quote.
The Last Line of Defense article then stated that the ""war on Christmas has gone on long enough.""
""If Mr. Bhalla doesn’t like it he can go back to his home country of IDontGiveAFuckistan and leave Americans to be Americans,"" stated the article.
Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli said that the only truthful part of the article is that Bhalla will become the mayor in January. The photo accompanying the article is of Bhalla and Zimmer in front of City Hall.
""Everything else is garbage,"" Melli told PolitiFact. ""I don’t know how else to put it.""
There was no Christmas gala (there was a Christmas tree lighting that was indeed open to the public). Also there is no intersection of 5th and Brussels in Hoboken. And Bhalla isn’t Muslim -- he is a Sikh.
Bhalla, a child of Indian immigrants, was born in New Jersey.
Melli said that he sent the fake news article to Bhalla and that the mayor-elect laughed.

"""‘The largest bust in U.S. history’ 412 Muslims arrested from Michigan!"" Hundreds of Muslim doctors in Detroit were arrested by the federal government in a record-breaking bust, stated an article on Facebook.
""The largest bust in U.S. history: 412 Muslims arrested from Michigan,"" stated a headline we saw in November on Fresh Media News.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While the headline is fake, because it describes all of the suspects as Muslims from Michigan without evidence, a key element of the story is based on real events: The federal government did charge 412 people nationwide in a health care bust in July.
Fresh Media News calls itself a website that provides ""daily updates of the hidden things."" We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website and sent a message via Facebook and did not get a reply. Similar articles ran on other websites in July.
The article portrays Michigan Muslims as rampant criminals.
""The state of Michigan is clearly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the last 8 years,"" stated the article.
Fresh Media News claims that federal officials made a bust in a $1.3 billion fraudulent scheme involving Medicare fraud, ripping off insurance companies and prescribing opioids.
Some of the basic details are muddled -- the headline says the 412 suspects were from Michigan while part of the article says officials arrested 412 people nationwide.
Here is what actually happened: On July 13, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the ""largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history.""
Federal authorities charged 412 defendants across about two dozen states, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving approximately $1.3 billion in false billings. Thirty-two of the defendants were from the Eastern District of Michigan .
Fresh Media News cited some accurate details in the case, including that the FBI raided medical offices in Detroit’s historic Fisher building and named one of the actual Michigan defendants: Mashiyat Rashid .
Prosecutors allege that Rashid ran a conspiracy starting in 2008 that involved six other defendants and various companies in which they recruited homeless people as patients and sent phony bills to Medicare, according to  The Detroit News .
The Detroit News described Rashid as a ""Muslim businessman, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh and is a U.S. citizen.""
While Fresh Media News wrote without evidence that the 412 suspects were Muslims, nothing in the federal documents we reviewed, including Sessions’ remarks, mentioned the religion of the defendant. We contacted Sessions’ press office and did not get a reply.
It’s not surprising that a fake news story would target Muslims in Michigan.
The Muslim population has been growing in Michigan for decades and is now about 2.75 percent of the state’s population as of 2015, according to a report by Muslims for American Progress, a project by the Institute for Policy Studies and Social Understanding that aims to educate the public about Muslims. (A Pew study estimates that Muslims comprise about 1 percent of the U.S.)
Michigan Muslims comprise more than 15 percent of the state’s medical doctors and more than 10 percent of the state’s pharmacists.",0,Freshmedianews.com
"Says ""by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels."" President Barack Obama recently announced a new initiative that was close to his heart: a national effort to close achievement gaps and create opportunities for minority boys.
""My Brothers Keeper,"" unveiled at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, combines philanthropy and research to help move young men of color from the streets into schools and the workforce.
""I'm going to pen this presidential memorandum directing the federal government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young men of color, and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies and with local communities to implement proven solutions,"" Obama said at the White House launch event.
Many Democrats in Congress voiced their support for Obama’s push to help young minorities. Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter.
""By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels,"" she tweeted .
It’s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama’s new effort. But is it accurate?
The Nation’s Report Card
When we contacted Slaughter’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a White House fact sheet with an almost identical claim: ""Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade – compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels.""
In turn, the White House said the numbers came from The Nation’s Report Card , a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race.
Broadly, proficiency is defined by the government as students being ""able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations.""
According to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level.
While 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark.
For each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics.
Gaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade.
It’s also worth noting that there’s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind.
But Slaughter’s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics, we had to dive deeper into the report.
Using the government’s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter’s numbers are right on.
By contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient.
And what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys.",1,Louise Slaughter
"""Productivity has risen 18 percent ...yet wages have stayed flat... There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000."" As she makes her case for the White House, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., promises voters that she'll do more to help the middle and working classes. Key to that pitch is the notion that things aren't going so well now.
""Productivity has risen 18 percent among American workers over the past six years, yet wages have stayed flat, and family incomes have fallen by nearly $1,000,"" she told a crowd in New York City on Dec. 5, 2007. ""There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000.""
The macroeconomic forces of a rapidly changing global economy are causing more trouble for many working people than the Bush administration, despite what Clinton and other Democratic candidates suggest.
U.S. Census Data from 1995 to 2005 show that those wages are down or stagnant for workers who have the least education, while earnings have increased for those with college degrees.
Increased competition from cheap foreign labor is squeezing U.S. factory workers and costing jobs, while wages have not kept pace with rising energy and health care prices, several studies say, including the 2006 State of Working America by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan advocate for the poor.
Productivity indeed is up about 18 percent since 2000, but income is down, and nearly 5-million more people are living in poverty than at the height of the last business cycle in 2000, government statistics show.
""All of that paints more of a picture about what individual households are seeing and reacting to,"" said Aviva Aron-Dine, a policy analyst for the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a nonpartisan advocacy group for the poor.

"Says Sen. John McCain was ""caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country."" U.S. Sen. John McCain’s attempt to smooth over a contentious phone call between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was against the law, according to several bloggers.
But their ire toward the Arizona Republican relies on a hard-to-establish link to a highly politicized law that no one has ever been convicted of violating.
""McCain caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country,"" blared the Facebook headline on several Internet posts critical of the senator on or after Feb. 3, 2017. The social media site flagged at least one undated example as part of its efforts to squash fake stories in users’ news feeds. In this case, the post isn’t fake in that details were made up, rather just inaccurate in how the details are portrayed.
The posts reference an initial phone call Trump made to Turnbull on Jan. 28. That call allegedly turned sour when Trump balked over an agreement former President Barack Obama struck to take in 1,250 refugees that Australia held in offshore detention centers.
But the ""highly illegal phone call"" that McCain made was on Feb. 2 , when he contacted Australian ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey to assure Hockey of McCain’s ""unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.""
""I asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote,"" McCain said in a statement .
That caused an uproar in some corners of the Internet. Several websites repurposed or made reference to an undated post that appears to originate at AngryPatriotMovement.com, which carried the same headline about McCain breaking the law.
The post linked to a Feb 3 BizPacReview.com article that said McCain was ""undermining"" Trump , and said McCain’s call to Australia’s ambassador ""might be a violation of the Logan Act.""
""The Logan Act says ANY citizen of the United States who ‘without permission of the United States’ either directly or indirectly ‘commences or carries on correspondence’ with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to ‘influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer’ in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years — or both,"" the AngryPatriotMovement.com post read.
But really, McCain wasn’t ""caught"" doing anything. His office put out the press release about contacting Hockey. And the Logan Act isn’t necessarily a law designed to root out near-treasonous behavior, the way the blogs make it sound.
The Logan Act dates back to 1798, when a Pennsylvania state legislator named George Logan went to France to negotiate a peace settlement over debts with the United States during the French Revolution, according to the Washington Post . You’ll recall Paul Giamatti agonizing over the issue in HBO’s John Adams .
Adams’ Federalist Party had opposed Logan’s efforts, so they passed a law that said private citizens couldn’t work on foreign policy issues without the government allowing it.
No one has ever been charged with a crime under the Logan Act, but its name comes up from time to time, usually when a lawmaker has contacted a foreign official for some purpose the opposing party doesn’t like.
Some brought up the act when U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went to Syria as Speaker of the House to attempt to wheel and deal with President Bashar al-Assad in 2007. It also was mentioned when 47 Republican senators wrote a letter to Iran in 2015 to try to scuttle Obama’s nuclear treaty. It even came up when Trump, as the GOP presidential nominee, asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails last year.
It’s highly doubtful that McCain, who has made a habit of serving as a foil for Trump , actually violated federal law. Stanford law professor Michael McConnell doubted the Logan Act could be used to keep a senator from talking to a country’s envoy about foreign affairs, which senators often do.

"Orrin Hatch co-sponsored a 1993 health care bill that had an individual mandate. With Keith Olbermann's recent departure from MSNBC, the cable news channel has re-shuffled its liberal talk show hosts and added a new pundit, Cenk Uygur (pronounced Jenk You-grr).
Uygur recently ripped Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for courting the tea party movement. First, Uygur showed video of Hatch saying that he, like the tea party, was opposed to the health care law.
""I was the one who raised the issue about the job-killing employer mandate, and of course the unconstitutional employee mandate,"" Hatch said. ""I've been all over the world for our country. Everywhere we go, people have always been amazed by America. And yet, we're in danger of losing the greatest country in the world. So we've got to fight back.""
""Here's what I'm amazed by -- Orrin Hatch,"" Uygur said. ""You're going to tell me you're tea party? There's no one who's more Republican establishment than Orrin Hatch, who's been there for approximately 800 years. ... By the way, did you hear him putting dirt on the mandate? He said, oh, I can't put a mandate. I'm totally against that. Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? ... It's unbelievable.""
We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years. (Hatch was elected in 1976, not 1210.) But we were interested in Uygur's comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate. We wondered if that were actually the case, so we decided to check it out.
Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups.
To counter that, the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls. Chafee's plan, one of several Republican alternatives, created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies. It also required everyone to buy insurance -- an individual mandate.
Chafee's plan was backed by a group of Republican senators, including Hatch, according to news reports from the time. When the plan was formally introduced as legislation, Hatch was one of the co-sponsors. Two other current senators also co-sponsored the plan: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
We examined the old legislation, which we found in the THOMAS legislative database. The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law. The main difference is how the fines work for those who don't buy insurance. The new law sets a dollar amount; the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
We contacted Hatch's office to ask for an explanation for Hatch's change of position, but we didn't hear back. Last year, Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., who had also co-sponsored the plan. Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993, backing away from policies on health care they once supported.
Uygur asked, ""Did you know that Hatch co-sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate?"" We didn't, but we checked the record. Hatch was the co-sponsor of a Republican-backed bill that included an individual mandate.",1,Cenk Uygur
"Says 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump’s proposal for child care ""go to the people making over $100,000 a year."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she cannot jump on board with President Donald Trump’s child care proposals because they won’t actually help the poorest Americans.
On CNN’s State of the Union, moderator Jake Tapper said, ""In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Trump renewed his commitment to child care and paid family leave ... Paid family leave, a big Democratic priority for a long time, is that something you could work with the president on?""
Pelosi said, ""The first conversation I had with him after the election, that week of the election, we talked about that subject, and a subject that his family is interested in as well. But what he has proposed is something that benefits -- 70 percent of the benefits go to people making over $100,000 a year.""
We decided to check out Pelosi’s claim.
It’s important to note she is not referring to the estimated benefits of paid family leave, but the monetary benefits of Trump’s child care tax proposals.
Trump has made no formal attempts to advance his paid family leave policy yet, although both Democratic and Republican senators introduced two different bills on this general issue. So all we have is an analysis of his proposal from the campaign.
Trump’s proposal includes six weeks of paid maternity leave if no policy is offered by an employer; tax deductions for child care expenses up to age 13, capped at the average cost of childcare per state; a refundable tax credit for child care costs for lower-income families; and expanding tax-free savings accounts for childcare and school tuition.
The Tax Policy Center, run by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, released its study of Trump’s child care plan Feb. 28, a few days before Pelosi’s interview. Pelosi’s spokesman confirmed she was citing this report on during her CNN interview.
The Tax Policy Center study found that 70 percent of total tax benefits would go to families earning more than $100,000.
The reason? Trump’s plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families. That’s because families with higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates. Lower-income families may spend less on child care because they often rely on informal, low-cost arrangements.
Chye-Ching Huang, one of the study’s co-authors and deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email, ""The estimate that 70  percent of the benefits go to those with incomes over $100,000 is conservative -- the share going to those with incomes over $100,000 could very well be higher.""
Analysts looked at three new tax benefits related to child care proposed by his campaign: the deduction for child care expenses, a refundable credit aimed at low-income families without stay-at-home parents, and the expansion of tax-free savings accounts.
According to their report, Trump’s plan would increase the average after-tax income for families by about $190 in 2017. Those with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. Families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year might see an average jump of $360.
Further, they say Trump’s proposed tax credit for lower-income families is worth less than the deduction. Taxpayers who claim the credit would benefit by up to 7.7 cents per dollar spent on child care. Those claiming the deduction may receive between 10 and 39.6 cents per dollar spent on child care. Lower income families are also less likely to place money into Trump’s proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity.
In sum, then, the report finds that Trump’s current family leave policy is regressive, helping families in higher income brackets more than those in lower-income ones.
Alan Cole, an economist from the Tax Foundation, said that he agreed with the distribution tables from the Tax Policy Center’s report. ""The only caveat I'd add is that campaign proposals like this one tend to be refined and revamped after people take office,"" he said. ""I could easily see the next version of the policy having a different distributional impact.""

"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest."" U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been criticized for waiting to fire an information technology employee who did work for her office until his recent arrest.
While many other Democratic members fired Imran Awan months ago when news reports stated he was under investigation, Wasserman Schultz waited until July 25, the day after his arrest for bank fraud. (Awan was a shared employee among multiple House members.)
For all of the questions about how Wasserman Schultz handled the situation, there have been unsubstantiated attacks on the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman from Broward County.
The website US Daily News 24 compiled various news reports, blogs and tweets about the Awan investigation in a July 28 post. However, the clickbait headline of the story is totally unsupported.
It states: ""Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest.""
There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz is headed to a mental health facility.
In fact, other than the headline, the article itself makes no mention of her going to a mental hospital or facing arrest -- and it’s unclear what the author is alluding to that she did ""overnight.""
Instead, the article contains some sweeping statements about her alleged state of mind with no evidence, such as there are reports that Wasserman Schultz ""has been an absolute wreck since Imran’s arrest"" and an unsourced text posted on twitter alleging that she was spotted berating her daughter about buying a $2 purse.
We found no contact information for US Daily News 24, although we left a comment in the comments section asking for evidence. We found the same post on Freedom Daily and used their contact form but did not get a reply.
The article does correctly state that Awan was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport while he was attempting to leave the country.
The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., states that on July 24 Awan had purchased a flight to Qatar and then to Lahore, Pakistan, with a return flight in January. He was arrested on one count of bank fraud related to allegations that he provided inaccurate information when applying for a home loan. He pleaded not guilty.
The criminal complaint makes no mention of allegations reported since February by Buzzfeed , Politico and The Daily Caller that Awan and other relatives were under investigation related to a procurement scam and theft of equipment and data. The articles we read attributed key information to unnamed sources.
There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz faces arrest.
Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, told the  Miami Herald , a PolitiFact Florida news partner, on Feb. 8 that ""no members are being investigated"" related to the actions of the House IT support staff.
Unrelated to this fact-check, the Miami Herald asked Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman David Damron on July 28 if she had scheduled any public events for the August congressional recess. Damron said that she planned to spend some time with family out of town during the first couple of weeks and would do district events later during the recess.
The A. Philip Randolph Institute, an AFL-CIO group, also announced that Wasserman Schultz will speak at the group’s education conference in Broward on Aug. 3.
Through Damron, Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact that the website is a ""false story.""",0,US Daily News 24
"""You can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters."" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized Republican Donald Trump during their second debate for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
Clinton questioned how such a religious test would be implemented, saying Trump’s comments have been ""extremely unwise and even dangerous.""
""And indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters,"" Clinton said at the Oct. 9 square-off in St. Louis, Mo.
Trump has adjusted the temporary ban on Muslim immigrants he once proposed to say he would instead suspend immigration from regions with a ""proven history of terrorism .""
Clinton has said before that Trump is being used "" to essentially be a recruiter "" for people to join the cause of terrorism.
Earlier this year, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, issued a 51-minute video telling ""Muslims of the West"" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States.
The video says the United States has a history of ""slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps.""
It then shows a video of Donald Trump where he is calling ""for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" until United States representatives can figure out what is going on. Trump made that statement after the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks.
The video calls for American Muslims to leave the United States and join the terrorist group, the Wall Street Journal reported .
This spring, Newsweek also reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip of Trump speaking about Brussels.
""Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show,"" Trump says in the video , as ISIS lets the phrase ""absolute horror show"" repeatedly echo and fade.
Clinton’s campaign sent us a Politico story about that video, pointing out that it also features ""English subtitles, musical accompaniment and a song of sorts, with the lyrics: ‘Brothers rise up! Claim your victory! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go for jihad.’ ""
Her campaign also pointed to Foreign Affairs and Time articles reporting that an ISIS spokesman wrote on ISIS-affiliated channel, ""I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump.""
Trump’s campaign did not return requests for comment.
Clinton is right about the Trump’s comments being incorporated into propaganda, but it’s difficult to know what effect his words have had on recruitment, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
""Obviously, we know less about how effective his comments have been as a recruiting tool -- reliable data is hard to come by,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""But that is how it's being used.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Mitt Romney is using ""a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah Senate race."" A Democratic candidate for Utah’s U.S. Senate seat claimed Republican opponent Mitt Romney is using $1 million of leftover donations to his unsuccessful presidential run to finance his Senate bid.
""The former Governor of Massachusetts is taking yet another short cut to the Utah Senate Seat,"" Nickie Titus, campaign manager for Democrat Jenny Wilson, said in a press release . ""Mitt certainly does things his way — moves to Utah from California (and) uses a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race.""
It turns out Wilson’s campaign is right: Romney is using $1 million from his failed presidential bid to fuel his Senate campaign. Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism.
Campaign fund-shifting
Romney’s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney’s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial — and flexible — bankroll.
Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group.
Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said.
""It happens all the time,"" said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. ""House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay.""
Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn’t mean it’s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that’s contrary to donors’ intentions.
""A donor may have supported Romney’s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney’s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election,"" Holman said. ""Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors’ funds without getting their approval.""
Romney followed suit
At the beginning of 2018, Romney for President, Inc. , the nonprofit organization that supported Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand. On Feb. 5, the organization transferred $1 million to Romney for Utah, Inc., according to an FEC filing .
To the chagrin of Romney’s opponents, the transfer from Romney’s presidential campaign to his Senate run comprises donations made mostly by non-Utah residents, according to the  Salt Lake Tribune .
""The $1 million is indicative of what we’re seeing from Mitt Romney. He’s bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race,"" Wilson told the Tribune. ""I’m a Utahn running for Utahns.""
The April 15, 2018, FEC filing, which covered the first three months of the year, shows the organization also made smaller disbursements for consulting work, email services and bank fees. At the end of the reporting period, Romney for President, Inc., had $222,755 cash on hand.",1,Jenny Wilson
"""Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump’s private messages in undercover sting."" An old headline making new waves on social media falsely claimed Twitter was caught leaking President Donald Trump’s private messages to the Justice Department as part of an undercover sting operation.
""Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump’s private messages in undercover sting,"" said a Jan. 11, 2018, headline from Neon Nettle, an online news site created to provide an ""educational and thought provoking"" alternative to the mainstream news media, according to its about page.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice,"" the Neon Nettle story said.
The headline is based on comments made by a Twitter engineer, but the engineer never said he had leaked information to the Justice Department.
The story cited a video from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O’Keefe, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building and was sued for $1 million in 2017.
Project Veritas has a proven history of using undercover reporting , hidden cameras and selectively-edited video recordings to serve a predetermined narrative. In 2017, the organization sent a woman posing as a sexual assault victim of Roy Moore — a candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama — to the Washington Post in an apparent effort to discredit the paper’s investigation into Moore’s predatory behavior.
For this particular sting video, Project Veritas used hidden cameras to surreptitiously record two separate conversations between undercover journalists and Clay Haynes, a senior network security engineer at Twitter, according to LinkedIn. The journalists, dressed in disguises, asked leading questions in a clear effort to elicit certain responses from Haynes.
""We’re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation (into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election),"" Haynes, who also expressed his personal disdain for Trump, said at one point. ""Basically, giving them every single tweet that he’s posted. Even the ones he’s deleted, any direct messages, any mentions.""
In the second interview, Haynes said of the possibility of turning over Trump’s messages, ""We have a subpoena process for that very reason."" When asked whether Twitter was working with the Justice Department, he declined to comment.
Both interviews occurred in January 2018, and Twitter issued a statement after Project Veritas published its video. ""The individual depicted in this video was speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent or speak for Twitter,"" a company spokesperson said . ""Twitter only responds to valid legal requests, and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request.""
""We deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a predetermined narrative,"" the spokesperson said. ""Twitter is committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules.""
It is unclear from the video whether Haynes knew he was being recorded, though he does not seem to be aware. It is illegal to record a private conversation without the consent of both parties in California, where the video was taken.
As Snopes previously noted , Project Veritas’ videos are ""virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips of the involved conversations"" because they use ""stitched-together, out-of-context remarks with no indication of what occurred or what was discussed just before and after the included portions.""
According to Twitter’s Help Center , legal processes are required to trigger the release of private messages. ""Non-public information about Twitter users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process,"" the company policy said. ""Requests for the contents of communications … require a valid search warrant or equivalent from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter.""
Haynes did not say that Twitter leaked private messages from Trump. He said only that the company would be ""more than happy to help the DOJ"" were such help ever triggered by a legal process.
We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any reports that Twitter was cooperating in this fashion with special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the 2016 election, although the company did meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss Russian bot accounts on its site.
But even if we were to take Project Veritas’ video at face value, the Neon Nettle headline was misleading. The video showed Twitter to be capable of granting access to Trump’s private messages — a capability that most technology companies maintain — but the company was not caught leaking them.

"Over the last 10 years, incomes for the top 1 percent ""have grown."" Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, ""they've seen their wages stagnate."" During the July 25, 2010 roundtable of ABC's This Week, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile made the case for extending tax cuts for low and middle-income families, rather than for the wealthy.
""Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate,"" she said.
Income inequality has become a fairly common Democratic talking point, so we decided to weigh in on the claim that while income for the top 1 percent has been increasing, it's been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country.
Brazile's office told us to check out a June 2010 report by Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher for the left-learning Center on Budget and and Policy Priorities. Sherman uses data from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher for Congress, to graph income for different groups over time. The data starts in 1979 and goes through 2007. ""After-tax incomes nearly quadrupled for the top 1 percent of Americans in the last three decades, while barely rising among middle- and lower-income households,"" Sherman writes.
We tracked down the raw CBO figures to see if our own calculations would match Sherman's. The numbers, which come from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), show average, inflation-adjusted to 2007, after-tax income. The chart shows how income has changed over time for five different income categories set by the IRS. There is additional data on the top 1 percent.
No matter how you slice it, Brazile is on firm ground. Those with incomes in the bottom 20 percent had mean income of $16,100 in 1997. In 2007, it climbed to $17,700 -- or up 9.9 percent. For the group on the next rung up the ladder, income grew by 15.9 percent. For those ranked between 41 and 60 percent of income --only some of whom are in the bottom 50 percent -- income grew from $48,000 in 1997 to $55,300, or about 15.2 percent. That’s not stagnant, but it’s small potatoes compared to a 74.6 percent jump in income for the top 1 percent of earners. Mean income for that group climbed from $755,700 to slightly more than $1.3 million between 1997 and 2007.
We then moved to income data from the U.S. Census. Those inflation-adjusted figures start in 1967 and go through 2008. Looking at the 10  years, 1998 to 2008, mean reported income for those at the bottom fell by 4.2 percent; for the next lowest income group it dropped by 3.9 percent, and for the group that includes some in the lowest half of incomes and some who are not, income decreased by 2.5 percent. During the same period, income for the top 5 percent (the figures do not include information on the top 1 percent), increased by about 0.5 percent. We should note, however, that if we look at income for the top 5 percent between 1998 and 2007 (as opposed to 2008 when the economy began spiraling downward), that's a 1.7 percent increase.
Finally, we contacted numerous independent economic experts, who, for the most part, said that Brazile's argument is accurate. ""The big picture statement is exactly right. No gains for bottom half, big gains for top 1 percent,"" wrote Irwin Garfinkel, professor of contemporary urban problems from Columbia University. Edward Wolff, economics professor at New York University, told us that, based on his calculations from the the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, ""income of the bottom half fell by 9 percent over the last 10 years [from 1998-2008] while the income of the top one percent rose by 40 percent.""
A few experts did take issue with Brazile's use of the phrase ""the last 10 years."" As we pointed out, the most recent data for the CBO ends in 2007. Census figures only go through 2008. If Brazile was truly talking about the last 10 years, i.e. from 2000 to 2010, as opposed to the last 10 years for which the data is available, one may argue that she engaged in a little bit of extrapolation. Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, told us that ""more and more of the compensation of the top 1 percent depends on the stock market,"" which took a plunge during the ongoing recession.
Still, Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, argues in a July 2010 paper that the ""Great Recession is unlikely to have a very large impact on top income shares and will certainly not undo much of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s"". Sherman also pointed out that by ""convention, it is often accepted to talk about the last 10 years as meaning the last 10 years for which the data exist.""
We also note that Brazile mentioned ""wages"" in the last part of her statement, which is a narrower term than income. Still, based on our review of the context of the conversation, our discussion with experts, and the statement itself --which mentions income twice, it seems clear that she was talking about income in both cases.
Donna Brazile said that while the incomes for the top 1 percent have climbed, they've been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country. We consulted data from the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. Census, and just to be sure, we double checked with independent economics experts. The CBO numbers showed relatively small increases in income for those in the bottom half, compared with the 74.6 percent gain for the top 1 percent. Mean income for the top 1 percent rose from $755,700 in 1997 to slightly more than $1.3 million 10 years later. The most recent 10-year data -- from Census -- shows income falling for those in the bottom 50 percent and increasing for the top 5 percent. Most of the experts we talked to said Brazile’s underlying argument is on solid ground.",1,Donna Brazile
"""More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas."" During debate on the Republican health care bill, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., spoke passionately about the impact it will have on women’s health and especially on Planned Parenthood.
""We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has bad news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for women,"" Maloney said on the House floor on March 16, 2017, the same day that the House Budget Committee approved the bill.
""The GOP plan makes Planned Parenthood ineligible for any reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one entire year,"" Maloney said. ""More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas.""
Maloney was right that the bill restricts funds for Planned Parenthood. The American Health Care Act has a provision that won’t allow states to use direct spending of federal funds on prohibited entities.  Planned Parenthood is a prohibited entity under the bill because it is a provider that is ""primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care"" or ""provides for abortion"" in any situation besides saving the life of the mother, incest or rape.
We were intrigued, however, by the claim that half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or underserved areas. It’s a tricky thing to measure, but the evidence suggests the claim is sound.
Our research
Maloney’s spokeswoman Jennifer Bell pointed us to data from Planned Parenthood’s website.
Statistics there show that 54% of Planned Parenthood facilities are located in health professional shortage areas, rural or medically underserved areas.  This percentage was calculated by the Health Resources & Services Administration Shortage Area Database system.
The HRSA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HRSA's programs help provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, or economically or medically vulnerable. The agency identifies areas where health care is difficult to come by.  Planned Parenthood matched up their locations to the HRSA data.
Mark Holmes, an associate professor in health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, told us the government system of identifying underserved areas is reliable.
""The HRSA database for shortage areas is pretty accurate.  In terms of additional context, there are multiple types of shortage areas,"" he explained.
Holmes said some shortage areas are designated as a ""population"" shortage area.  ""This area is okay in general, but for certain kinds of populations, they may have a tough time getting the care they need,"" he said.
He used an example of ""low-income"" populations.  ""Medicaid beneficiaries may live in an area with lots of providers, none of whom take Medicaid, so then although it looks like the area is well-served, there is actually a considerable shortage,"" Holmes said.
""In Planned Parenthood’s case, I don’t think that is a problem because so many of Planned Parenthood’s clients are lower income, according to their data.""
We ran this by two other health care experts, and they said that the claim was accurate.",1,Carolyn Maloney
"""You know, Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years..."" To highlight the different approaches between Democrats and Republicans on keeping troops in Iraq, Sen. Hillary Clinton pointed to remarks Sen. John McCain made in the days before the New Hampshire primary that indicated his support for a prolonged military commitment in the region. Clinton has said that, if elected, one of her first official actions would be to direct military leaders to draft a viable plan to begin a phased withdrawal within 60 days. Her goal is to have most troops out of Iraq by the end of 2013.
Clinton's account of McCain's position rings true. The Arizona senator was an enthusiastic supporter of President Bush's surge and opposes a timetable for troop withdrawal. He was somewhat glib about the issue during a Jan. 3, 2008, town hall meeting in Derry, N.H. When a voter asking a question made the point that President Bush raised the possibility American troops would be in Iraq for 50 years, McCain interrupted by saying, ""maybe 100.""
McCain went on to note the United States has maintained a military presence for decades in such places as Japan and South Korea. He said he supported such a commitment in a global hot spot like Iraq where al-Qaida continues to wield influence and recruit followers — as long as there aren't American casualties.
McCain expanded on those thoughts three days later during an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, asserting that most Americans share his views. ""We have a base in Turkey.  We have a base in Japan, Germany. We've had bases there.  It's not American presence that bothers the American people, it's American casualties,"" McCain said.  ""And if Americans are safe wherever they are in the world, Americans — the American people don't mind that.  So what I believe we can achieve is a reduction in casualties to the point where the Iraqis are doing the fighting and dying, we're supporting them, and, over time, then it'll be the relation between the two countries.""
McCain skirted questions about what kind of troop levels are acceptable in coming decades.
Because McCain unabashedly entertains the possibility of an open-ended military commitment in Iraq — with little more than a proviso that American personnel should not come in harm's way — we rule Clinton's statement True.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered."" A fake news story tried to connect the random deaths of doctors with conspiracy theories around vaccination.
Neonnettle.com posted a story headlined,""Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines found murdered,"" on March 2, 2017. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds.
The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public.
We reached out to the website but got no response. (Neonnettle later emailed us to say it deleted the post.)
Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high.
That theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards.  Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven.
Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery.  But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy.
Dr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations . Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way.
Another doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money.
Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry.
In a follow-up article , healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide .
Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor, went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff’s office told the  Bismarck Tribune  that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case.
The only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by several studies . Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism.
According to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff’s Office , his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories.
While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet’s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch.

"""Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies."" As part of a dust-up over which candidate is more likely to stand up to Big Oil, Hillary Clinton knocks Barack Obama for taking money from people who work for oil companies.
The ad starts by showing Obama saying, ""I don't take money from oil companies."" The Clinton ad's narrator chides Obama for boasting about this when corporations are prohibited by law from donating to political candidates. ""But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies,"" the narrator ads.
Obama would have been correct if he had said he didn't take money from oil company lobbyists or political action committees. (He did make this point in a later ad, which we found to be Mostly True; see it here .)
The ad also is correct that Obama accepted $222,309 from executives and employees of oil companies, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's worth noting those donations could be from anyone from the CEO to the janitor. People who donate to political candidates are required to list their occupation and employer. It's important to note that this rule is has far from perfect compliance; sometimes people don't fill it in at all.
Clinton doesn't mention the fact that she accepted even more money from executives and employees of oil companies — $309,363, according to the center. And she accepted about  $442,800 from energy lobbyists, according to the center, though not all of that is from oil and gas alone.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""We now consume at the federal level 25 percent of the gross domestic product. Historically we were at 20 percent. So we've taken 5 percent away from the private sector."" With the rise of the fiscally conservative tea party and the recent release of a draft report by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the nation's fiscal challenges have rocketed up the list of urgent agenda items in Washington.

On CBS' Face the Nation , host Bob Schieffer asked Paul whether he would favor eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, as the commission suggested.
""No, once again, I'm on the other side,"" Paul said. ""I want to be on the side of reducing spending. So I think really the compromise is where you find the reductions in spending. But I don't think the compromise is in raising taxes. I mean, you have to put things in perspective. We now consume at the federal level 25 percent of the gross domestic product. Historically we were at 20 percent. So we've taken 5 percent away from the private sector. And the private sector is the engine that creates all these jobs. I want to send that 5 percent back to the private sector.""
We'll focus on whether Paul's numbers are correct.
As we did with Conrad's comment, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole.
The most recent full-year figure is for 2009, and it shows that federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of gross domestic product that year, or 25 percent when rounded up. So Paul is correct.
The second statistic -- the historical level of spending as a percentage of GDP -- is slightly more complicated, but here too Paul is basically correct. Over the past 40 years, spending has averaged 20.7 percent of GDP, though it has varied a bit over the years. In both the 1970s and the decade beginning in 2000, it was almost exactly 20 percent. In the 1990s, it was slightly higher, while in the 1980s it exceeded 22 percent.
In fact, the only other years since 1950 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the last recession that rivaled the current one in severity, the 1981-82 recession. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps.
So in 1983, under a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, the government spent just 1.2 percentage points less than the current level, which suggests that the recession shouldn't be ignored as a major reason why spending is so high.
Still, Paul's larger point is valid. Federal spending is now approximately 25 percent of GDP, and that level is roughly 5 percentage points higher than the historical pattern.",1,Rand Paul
"Federal spending is ""the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years (and) revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years."" With the rise of the fiscally conservative tea party and the recent release of a draft report by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the nation's fiscal challenges have rocketed up the list of urgent agenda items in Washington.
We'll take a look at two comments on federal spending made on the Nov. 14, 2010, Sunday talk shows -- one by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and the other by Sen.-elect Rand Paul, R-Ky. We'll address Conrad's here.
In an interview on ABC's This Week With Christiane Amanpour , Conrad -- who chairs the Senate Budget Committee and serves on the presidentially appointed panel -- said, ""If you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation.""
Let's take a look at Conrad's numbers.
As we did with Paul's item, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole.
In 2009, the last full year available, federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of GDP. That's higher than it's been in any year since 1949 -- 60 years prior. You have to go back to 1946 to find a higher percentage -- 24.8 -- and that was a year in which the nation was winding down high rates of spending for World War II. (From 1943 to 1945, the height of the war, federal spending ranged from 41 percent to 43 percent of GDP.)
Clearly, recessions have an impact on how high this percentage gets. The only other years since 1946 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the 1981-82 recession -- the last one that rivaled today's in severity. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP growth and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps.
Either way, Conrad is correct on spending. What about tax revenue as a percentage of GDP?
In 2009, tax receipts accounted for 14.8 percent of GDP. According to the table, tax receipts as a share of GDP were always higher all the way back through 1950, when they accounted for 14.4 percent of GDP. That would be 59 years -- not quite 60, but very, very close.
The recession factors into the tax revenue statistic as well. Both the 2008 stimulus package under President George W. Bush and the 2009 stimulus under President Barack Obama included tax breaks as a major component.
Because the statistics show a number so close to 60 years -- and because Conrad was speaking during a television interview rather than a prepared speech or written statement -- we'll give him some leeway and rate the statement True.",1,Kent Conrad
"""Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die.’"" Oprah Winfrey gave a speech at the Golden Globes Jan. 7 that focused on race, gender, injustice and the importance of speaking the truth, all of which fueled talk about Winfrey running for president in 2020.
The speculation has led to numerous claims about her past statements recirculating on Facebook including her alleged comments about white people in 2014:
""Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die,’ "" stated an Oct. 12, 2014, headline on American News .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the headline distorts what Winfrey said — and where she said it.
While the headline said that Oprah made the comment about white people on Fox News, Winfrey’s comments came in an interview with the BBC.
Winfrey was interviewed by the BBC ’s Will Gompertz on Nov. 13, 2013, to coincide with the release of her film The Butler in which she played Gloria Gaines, the wife of a White House butler.
Gompertz asked Winfrey to weigh in about whether racism still exists.
Winfrey said that society has evolved on race relations, but there are still places where people are terrorized because they are black.
""As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem is not solved. There is a whole generation -- I said this for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south -- there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die.""
Winfrey’s overall point during the interview is that race relations have improved from decades ago, but there are older people in the United States and other countries who grew up surrounded by racism. The inference of her comments is that when older racists die out, that particular type of racism will die out.
Note that Winfrey didn’t say ""all white people have to die"" — she didn’t say ""white people"" at all.
While some on the left have shown some support for Winfrey’s 2013 statement, her comments drew criticism from conservatives.
About a week after her BBC interview, her comments were criticized on Fox News' The Kelly File by former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla ., a Fox News commentator.
West criticized Winfrey and Obama for trying ""to use the race card to talk about the failures and the faults not in his racial content but in the content of his character and the failure of his policies.""

"Every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II — more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined. Congress recently gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to regulate tobacco, and George Will is not impressed.
He said the new law is flawed because it restricts advertising (new rules could ""merit a constitutional challenge""), because it is supported by the tobacco industry (""a crystalline example of Washington business as usual"") and because it it perpetuates what Will calls a government ""addiction to tobacco tax revenue.""
""The February expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program is supposed to be financed by increased tobacco taxes, so this health care depends on an ample and renewable supply of smokers,"" he wrote in a June 18, 2009,  Washington Post  column. Governments will never outlaw smoking because ""governments cannot loot tobacco companies that do not flourish.""
Will thinks the new law is no good, but he's certainly no fan of smoking either, and he made this claim to demonstrate his aversion to the habit:
""Three decades ago, public outrage killed an automobile model (Ford's Pinto) whose design defects allegedly caused 59 deaths,"" he wrote. ""Yet every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II — more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined.""
More than AIDS? More than car accidents? We were skeptical, so we decided to take a look ourselves.
It seems that Will plucked part of his claim from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a leading advocate for the new law. According to the organization, about 400,000 people die from their own smoking each year, and about 50,000 die from second-hand smoke annually. And according to the group's Web site, ""Smoking kills more people than alcohol, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined.""
Even though that fact is repeated by many antismoking campaigns, and by the American Cancer Society, we decided to crunch the numbers ourselves. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2006, when their database was last updated, 22,073 people died of alcohol, 12,113 died of AIDS, 43,664 died of car accidents, 38,396 died of drug use — legal and illegal — 18,573 died of murder and 33,300 died of suicide.
That brings us to a total of 168,119 deaths, far less than the 450,000 that die from smoking annually.
As for the part about World War II, Will came up with this comparison himself. About 292,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines were killed in battle during World War II, according to a U.S. Census Bureau April 29, 2004, report in commemoration of the new World War II memorial in Washington, D.C. An additional 114,000 members of U.S. forces died of other causes during the war, bringing the total to 406,000 people.
Will's claim — that smoking kills more people annually than in World War II or from other dangerous diseases and habits — holds up with the CDC and the Census Bureau. As a result, we give Will a True.",1,George Will
"""The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago."" The Republican presidential candidates sparred over many issues in the CNN debate, including the potency of pot.
On drug policy, there was talk about expanded rehabilitation and prison reform to reduce the number of nonviolent prisoners. When it came to marijuana, one candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the hardest line, saying he would enforce a federal ban nationwide.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul favored allowing states like Colorado do as they please. So did former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who explained his position by acknowledging his own use. ""So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom's not happy that I just did.""
Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina shared the view that states should decide for themselves, but she offered an important caution.
""The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago,"" Fiorina said.
We thought it would be good to explore whether pot has become more potent since the 1970s. This is something we’ve looked at before.
The main psychoactive agent in marijuana is THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.
THC levels differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years.
But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent?
The answer is yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time.
The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period.
Back in the late 1970s , the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research with the monitoring project, told us in an interview for a prior fact-check.
Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007.
But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said.
For the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s uncertainty about what rising THC levels mean.
Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level.
In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs.
Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact.",1,Carly Fiorina
"""You’re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas"" than find in-person voter fraud. The Voting Rights Act turned 50 on Aug. 6, but the anniversary also doubled as an occasion for voting rights advocates to celebrate a new victory: The day before, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas’s 2011 photo ID law was unconstitutional, because it violated the rights of minority voters.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., went on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 9 to explain why he supported the decision: ""Take Texas for example, where Lyndon Johnson's obviously from, they passed these voter ID laws. In the decade before it, 10 years, they only prosecute two people for in-person voter ID, only two people. You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud.""
We were surprised by the colorful comparison. So we decided to see if we could figure out whether lightning really is more likely to strike in Texas than people trying to cast ballots using fake identities.
The odds
In 2014, the National Weather Service gave the odds of being struck by lightning as 1 in 960,000. Their methodology consisted of taking the number of reported deaths and injuries (267) and then adding in another 63 estimated injuries, since not every injury caused by lightning will be properly reported, or even reported at all.
Texas had the second-highest number of lightning-related fatalities from 1959 to 2013, behind only Florida. But that’s mostly because Texas is so big, both in terms of area and population; once you adjust the death rate, Texas actually ranks 33rd.
An expert from the National Weather Service confirmed to us that the probability of being struck by lightning in Texas is slightly lower than the national average, right around 1 in 1.35 million.
So how does this 1 in 1.35 million chance compare to the probability of finding voter fraud?
To find out, we first counted up the total number of ballots cast from 2000 to 2014 using the Texas Secretary of State’s online record . The website includes presidential, congressional, and special elections, but skips over a lot of the more local ones. We came up with just about 71.5 million votes cast, but since the database isn’t comprehensive, we rounded up to 72 million (though that’s probably still an underestimate).
Before delving into how many cases of voter fraud there are, here’s a quick definition. Voter fraud is ""the intentional corruption of the electoral process by voters. This covers knowingly and willingly giving false information to establish voter eligibility, and knowingly and willingly voting illegally or participating in a conspiracy to encourage illegal voting by others,"" according to Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud.
Minnite goes on to distinguish between election fraud — which includes fraud perpetrated by other parties involved in elections, such as advocacy groups or election officials — and voter fraud, which is a subset of election fraud committed specifically by voters.
Booker’s press secretary said he was referring only to in-person voter fraud, or voter impersonation, which is the type targeted by voter ID laws, and given the full context of Booker’s comments, that makes sense. Looking at the kind of fraud that voter ID laws aim to prevent excludes certain categories of fraud, such as those involving absentee ballots.
A spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent us information on electoral prosecutions. Since 2002, there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved. Some of these were dismissed; others were classified as a pre-trial diversion, which generally means that authorities agreed not to charge the defendant.
In total, then, there were 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions, for a total of 60 cases of election fraud. Our next step was to identify how many cases were of in-person voter fraud. We reached out to experts who have studied these cases in detail.
Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law.
""There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots.  There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls,"" Levitt said. ""There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls.""
Minnite, the Rutgers professor, pointed us to 2012 court testimony from Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that only two of these cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. So Booker was off by one when he claimed two people had been prosecuted in the ten years before the ID law was implemented.
Levitt, for his part, found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 that could have been prevented by an ID rule. Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014.
Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes makes the chance of voter fraud 1 in 18 million.",1,Cory Booker
"President Barack Obama ""had the legal authority"" to strike Syria without a vote from Congress. For people who strongly favor U.S. action against Syria, one of the questions they’re asking is why President Barack Obama hasn’t acted already.
Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who supports intervention, faced that question on CNN’s  Crossfire .
Host S.E. Cupp asked, ""After two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, (and) two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?
""Well, I wish we were not pausing,"" Lieberman said, adding, ""I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it.""
We wondered whether Lieberman was right. (Lieberman was traveling and did not respond.)
United States law
The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution  set the terms for military engagement. In Article II, Section 2, the Constitution says the president is commander in chief of the armed forces. Then, in Article I, Section 8, it assigns the right to declare war to Congress. The last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II, when Franklin Roosevelt was president.
Since then, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions.
In 1973, Congress, frustrated with the Vietnam War, passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution required that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise.
No president has ever conceded that Congress can limit the president’s power as commander in chief. Even as Obama announced that he would seek a congressional resolution, he affirmed that ""I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization.""
Presidents have danced around the War Powers Resolution. They will report military engagement to Congress but specifically omit mention of the section of the law, Section 4(a)(1), that triggers the 60-day limit. Only one president, Gerald Ford, has ever referred to that clause in a report to Congress. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush never did.
There is debate over the legal weight of the War Powers Resolution and what the Constitution allows. Sen. Rand Paul, R- Ky., who appeared on CNN’s Crossfire on Sept. 9, seemed to invoke both against presidential authority. Paul speculated on what Obama would do if Congress voted against the use of force in Syria.
""The real question is would he even abide by our verdict, would he abide by the congressional verdict,"" Paul said. ""Would he obey the Constitution and say, ‘I've been told I don't have authority; therefore, I can't do it?’""
But in a case involving Clinton and Kosovo , the courts have said members of Congress lack the standing to sue to get a president to comply with the War Powers Resolution. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, letting the decision stand.
During the Libyan conflict, Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote  that by regulating the principle that the president ""may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress,"" the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that the president can act unilaterally.
Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said while the Constitution trumps all other laws, ""many legal scholars have concluded that the War Powers Resolution unconstitutionally restricts the president's authority.""
Arend said the president has the authority for ""quick, limited uses of force.""
Other experts we’ve asked have generally agreed with this line of argument. In short, even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. An unresolved legal issue is what happens if forces are kept in place for a longer period of time, but at this moment, no one is proposing that military option.
Lieberman was discussing whether Obama had the legal authority to act without Congress within the framework of U.S. law. We should note that there's a separate question of whether the United States as a country would have legal authority to attack Syria; we addressed that question in a separate story . Here, we're only considering Obama's legal authority within the context of U.S. law.",1,Joe Lieberman
"""An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom."" The former British ambassador to the United States was hospitalized after being attacked in a tube station. Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition.
Some bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump’s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration.
Earlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station.
An article, posted on clickbait site Neon Nettle , claimed that Meyer was ""savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom."" This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives.
We decided to investigate whether Trump’s visit was tied directly to Meyer’s attack.
The editorial
A few days before the protests, the Independent published an editorial written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked.
In the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump.
""Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order,"" he writes.
Meyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change, engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative.
Neon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up ""a gang of anti-Trump protestors.""
The attack
Meyer’s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: ""He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.""
However, London police said it is more likely that Meyer’s assailants wanted to rob him . There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted.
The Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by ""a mob of thugs"" involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police.
Additionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and a day before Trump arrived in the country .
The Neon Nettle also alleges that ""violent riots"" have occurred throughout London in response to Trump’s visit. While there were massive protests against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a single altercation outside of a pub , one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter.",0,Bloggers
"""First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs."" Taking a knee in protest during the national anthem has led the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team to bankruptcy, a fake viral post on Facebook said.
""First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs,"" said a Feb. 2 headline on TopBuzz , an open platform where anyone can post articles and videos.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
We found that there is no evidence that the Jaguars plan to file for bankruptcy as a result of players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality or injustice against African-Americans.
The fact-checking website Snopes found that the same story was posted by Patriot Post , a satirical website , on Dec. 3. The article has since been posted by many other websites including Defense USA , Santa Christmas and Policetask .
The Feb. 2 story said that ""last week"" 31 of 42 men on the Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem. (The Jaguars’ schedule shows their last game was Jan. 21, so technically they didn’t play the week before Feb. 2.)
The players angered ""every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag,"" the story said.
The story said that the Jaguars were ""quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week.""
We found no such court in Atlanta, and we found there is a bankruptcy court much closer to home: the Florida Middle Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville .
We searched news reports and found nothing about the Jaguars moving toward bankruptcy.
Forbes valued the Jaguars at about $2 billion , in 25th place, in it’s 2017 ranking of the value of NFL teams.
The controversy about football players’ silent protests began in 2016, when then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick initially sat, and later switched to taking a knee, during the pre-game anthem to protest racial discrimination, especially at the hands of police.
Those protests became even more politicized after President Donald Trump tweeted Sept. 23, 2017 that any such players who don’t stand during the national anthem should be fired.
The next day, dozens of NFL players nationwide took a knee in protest, including some Jaguars players during their game in London.
The Jaguars drew particular attention because their owner, Shahid Khan , a Pakistan-born Muslim and only nonwhite NFL owner, publicly showed his support for the protests. Khan joined his team on the field and locked arms to show solidarity during the game.
""We have a lot of work to do and we can do it, but the comments made by the president make it harder,"" Khan said in a statement. ""That's why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation.""
Khan had donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration but has also criticized Trump’s attempt to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries.
We emailed the Jaguars’ public relations office and did not get a reply.
The protests by NFL players have fueled multiple fake news stories including that a flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway, and that the NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem and that Fox Sports cancelled NFL broadcasts .
All of those stories rated Pants on Fire, and in this case the claim that the Jaguars declared bankruptcy over ""kneeling thugs"" is also made up.",0,Bloggers
"""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans"" A conservative website falsely claimed that U.S. representatives to the United Nations promised to push for gun-control policies at home.
""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans,"" said a July 5, 2018, headline from the Conservative Daily Post website. The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for ""freedom-loving Americans"" who support ""limited government under the Constitution,"" according to its about page .
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a ""new international gun registry"" and a chain email that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons.
As with these past statements, there is also a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference.
The report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed ""to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ … that will enforce ‘proper management’ of ‘small arms and light weapons’ stockpiles.""
The report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens.
""In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people,"" the story said. ""If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional.""
Citing six points spelled out in the ""implementation at the national level"" section of the conference’s outcome document , the story said the meeting resulted in the United States’ willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights.
But the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons.
According to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree ""to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management — and to engage in cooperation and assistance.""
Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to the U.N.'s list of participants. The State Department and the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the role of U.S. representatives at the conference.
Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.
""The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,"" Dorminey wrote in an email. ""The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.""
""Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.""

"Says David Hogg wasn’t at school during the Parkland school shooting. Multiple internet bloggers falsely claimed that student David Hogg was not on the campus of  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the school shooting happened Feb. 14.
The inaccurate claims surfaced after CBS News produced ""39 Days,"" a documentary of several Stoneman Douglas High School students including Hogg. At the beginning of the video, Hogg, described as a student journalist, explained his immediate actions following the shooting that left 17 people dead.
Some bloggers took the 14-second soundbite to insinuate that Hogg wasn’t actually at school when the shooting took place.
""In a recently leaked excerpt of a CBS documentary, David Hogg admits he was at home during the Parkland shooting,"" reads the opening of a story on Squawker.org .
""David Hogg admits he wasn’t at school during Parkland school shooting,"" says a headline on DailyPresser.com.
None of those claims are true.
The inaccurate posts say that Hogg’s comments directly contradict statements in a Feb. 15  Time Magazine  interview. Hogg said he heard a gunshot while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m.
The blogs juxtaposed that statement with the following statement from Hogg in the CBS documentary: ""On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.""
People questioned how Hogg could be at school when the shooting started and also be riding his bike three miles to get his camera. And if Hogg really did leave school; how did he get back on to campus if the area was on lockdown?
The timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing, but the blogs didn’t try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy.
Here’s what happened.
Hogg was at the school during the shooting. Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet.
Sometime after that, he went home.
At around 6 p.m., Hogg went back to get interviews, according to Vox .
""The evening after the shooting, Hogg says, he biked up to the school, where the media was still camped out,"" the article says. ""This time, he put himself in front of the camera, making his first — but not final — plea for an end to mass shootings.""
Regardless of this information, other conservative news websites including InfoWars and RedState jumped the gun and reported that the CBS interview ""cast doubt"" on Hogg’s whereabouts during the school shooting.
Sometime after the original stories, both websites issued ""updates"" on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hogg’s quote without context.
But not every site did.
""It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context,"" wrote conservative Florida writer  Sarah Rumpf, author of the errant RedState story. ""Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street.""

"Say ""Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."" Did Pope Francis say that the rights of Muslim migrants are more important than any country’s safety concerns about them?
That’s what a largely plagiarized story on the website opreminfo.com claimed. But what he said was more nuanced.
Facebook flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
So we decided to investigate.
It turns out that a large part of the article is copied, word-for-word, from a 2017 Reuters article titled, ""Pope says migrants’ rights should override national security concerns."" The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants.
Reuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story.
But this recently posted article has a few problems.
First, there's an issue of timing.
The story begins with the statement, ""Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants."" The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a message the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees.
In it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, ""Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate.""
He then goes on to describe the task of ""welcoming"" as follows:
""Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation … The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security … The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization.""
The opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope ""urged political leaders on Monday,"" even though the pope’s remarks were published nearly a year ago.
Secondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to ""Muslim migrants."" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for ""broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally.""
We didn’t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope’s message .",1,Bloggers
"""The U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent."" Let’s be honest: When Hillary Clinton announced she was writing a memoir on her four years as Secretary of State, everyone had one question. What would she say about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya?
As it turns out, Clinton did not disappoint — at least on that topic. While critics have called the book a bit of a snoozer, the chapter on Benghazi is one of the longest in Hard Choices. The book explains what happened and how the State Department reacted — and offers a full-throated rebuke of Republican criticisms.
In defending the United States’ response to the attack, one of the factors Clinton noted was that there’s a gap between popular perceptions about the country’s military capabilities and the reality.
""Critics have questioned why the world’s greatest military force could not get to Benghazi in time to defend our people,"" Clinton said. ""Part of the answer is that, despite having established United States Africa Command in 2008, there just wasn’t much U.S. military infrastructure in place in Africa. Unlike in Europe and Asia, the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent.""
Since Libya is located on the Mediterranean Sea, on Africa’s northern coast, Clinton’s claim that the U.S. military is ""nearly nonexistent"" in Africa is pretty consequential to the debate.
In 2007, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would create a singular African command responsible for military operations throughout the continent. Prior to its creation, jurisdiction over Africa was split between combat headquarters in the Pacific, European and Middle East regions.
The motivation for the change was that Pentagon planners argued that terrorism and extremism spread more easily in countries with weak governments and poor citizens susceptible to ideological messaging. In creating what would become known as AFRICOM, the U.S. hoped to improve its own security by partnering with developing countries in Africa to better handle their own security concerns and avoid another Afghanistan.
Pentagon officials also thought, however, that a large U.S. military presence in these countries could become counterproductive, offering propaganda opportunities for terrorists and breeding anti-American sentiments, said Joseph Siegel, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University.
The goal all along, he said, was to have a ""light footprint."" Instead of a large scale operation, small groups would work with African countries in training African troops to handle the unique security issues within their own borders.
''Bases? Garrisons? It's not about that,'' then-Africa Commander Gen. William E. Ward of the Army told the New York Times when AFRICOM opened in 2008. ''We are trying to prevent conflict, as opposed to having to react to a conflict.""
How small was the presence? A spokesman for Clinton told PolitiFact that AFRICOM is not even based in Africa. Its headquarters are in Germany, where about 1,500 of its 2,000 personnel — troops, civilians and contractors — are located. There’s very little military infrastructure or advanced weaponry and warships.
Of the Department of Defense’s annual budget of $520 billion, the Africa Command accounted for just $275 million in 2012. An AFRICOM spokesman noted that Europe — geographically one-third the size of Africa -- has 12 times the number of U.S. troops. Even smaller countries like Afghanistan and South Korea have five times the U.S. forces than all of Africa does.
""It’s the smallest of the commands in resources and personnel, and to my knowledge it controls very few assets that it would deploy on its own,"" Siegel said.
There is one U.S. military base on the continent — Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, a country in the African Horn. Between 2,000 and 4,000 personnel are typically stationed there. That includes some troops, but many of those individuals are contractors or military personnel who are there to run base operations, said Larry Hanauer, a senior international policy analyst at RAND Corporation, a think tank.
""We do not have combat aircraft permanently based in Africa,"" Hanauer said. ""There are transportation aircraft in Camp Lemonnier,"" but not fighter jets.
Even if Camp Lemonnier had those resources, Djibouti is some 2,000 miles away from Benghazi. Points in Europe are much closer, such as Rome, which is about 800 miles away.
At the time of the attacks, AFRICOM had to borrow an emergency response force from Europe Command because it did not yet have one. According to a New York Times article, the Africa Command did not have a gunship or armed drones.
Asked whether he thought Clinton’s statement was accurate, RAND’s Hanauer said, ""I think it’s more accurate than not."" Siegel of National Defense University agreed that it was a ""fair statement.""
So did Michael O'Hanlon, a director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. ""Hillary's right. The headquarters is in Germany and our total military force on the continent is a total of a few thousand at most dispersed in various small locations, not operational bases.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"""President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" but China and India will still be allowed to increase their emissions. On Day 2 of the climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin decided to weigh in.
Her op-ed, published in the Dec. 9, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , enumerated her concerns about a series of e-mails that skeptics say show disagreement over the seriousness of climate change and President Barack Obama's plan to pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels. We wrote a separate story on the e-mails . Here, we'll look at the emissions questions.
Palin argues that developing countries, like India and China, should at least be equal partners in the effort to slow global warming; it's unfair for the United States to shoulder the burden.
""Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen -- which actually allow them to increase their emissions -- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" she wrote.
Is that really what is happening?
On Nov. 27, 2009, China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
That may sound like a lot, but it's important to read the fine print here. China is talking about lowering carbon intensity. It's a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output. Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy, but not as quickly as they would have otherwise.
""Let's say you commit to an intensity target of -6% per year in carbon/GDP,"" wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey, professor at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ""If your GDP grows at 10% per year, that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4% per year. So you're improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing.""
Indeed, China's GDP is growing rapidly. In the third quarter of this year, it grew 8.9 percent, likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent.
On Dec. 4, India offered a similar proposal. Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020. It's a landmark announcement for India; traditionally, the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But like China, India's economy is growing rapidly, and with it its carbon emissions.
Obama, on the other hand, is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions, explained Koomey. (Obama's plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap-and-trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives. A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut.) Koomey, like many climate scientists, say overall cuts -- even from developing countries -- are necessary to really slow down climate change.
While the United States' proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India, they're less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius.
So, where does that leave Palin's claim? She's correct that China and India's plans will allow them to increase emissions, while the United States would have to cut back. For this claim, Palin gets a True.",1,Sarah Palin
"Health care premiums for consumers have doubled since 2001. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper
Roll Call
in which he said, ""Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled."" We address the first part of this statement in another item ; we'll take up the second half here.
The 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its data stretch from 1999 to 2009. (Even though Rockefeller didn't explicitly say it, we'll assume he was talking about the period since 2001 when he made this assertion.)
In 2001, average annual premiums for single people were $2,689, a number that rose to $4,824 by 2008 — a 79 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $7,061 to $13,375 — an 89 percent increase.
So, in neither case did the cost of benefits actually double, although they are in the ballpark. However, if you read Rockefeller's language closely, he did say, ""premiums for consumers have doubled"" — and if you use the data for the employee-paid portion of health benefits by itself, he's right.
For individuals, the employee cost rose from $355 to $779 and for families it rose from $1,787 to $3,515. The former jump is easily double, while the latter is just shy of double. Using this calculation, Rockefeller is right.",1,Jay Rockefeller
"Guantanamo Bay detainees will get the H1N1 vaccine. The Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 vaccine has given conservatives plenty to complain about. First, the government got behind schedule with its massive vaccination plans. And then came reports that the Pentagon was planning to vaccinate the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Sean Hannity complained of the hypocrisy on his Nov. 2, 2009, show.
""So you were hoping to get the H1N1 vaccine,"" he said. ""Well, if the vaccine hasn't reached a doctor's office near you, that might be because it's on its way to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That's right. A military spokesman announced Gitmo detainees will receive the vaccine sometime this month. That's well before it's expected to be available to the public at large. Seems the Obama administration has its priorities straight. Doesn't it?""
Given the confusion over the program -- and a White House denial about the Guantanamo vaccinations -- we decided to look into Hannity's claim.
It all started on Oct. 30, when CNN ran a story quoting Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, who said the Pentagon would be offering the H1N1 vaccines to people held at the camp.
""Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination,"" she told CNN. ""JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health.""
The Associated Press ran a similar story on Nov. 2.
The news sparked an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers of both parties. They said pregnant women, children and the elderly should have priority access to the limited supply of vaccines over the Guantanamo detainees.
On Tuesday, Nov. 3, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a press briefing that, ""There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there's no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo."" But the same day, a Pentagon spokesman said that a shipment of vaccines would eventually be sent to the prison, although he said the detainees would get the vaccine only after it was given to active-duty troops, contractors and others working for the government.
The most recent news reports say that about 300 vaccines arrived at the installation on Monday, Nov. 9. According to the Associated Press, it's unlikely those vaccines will be given to prisoners. Instead, they are meant for military personnel, contractors and U.S. workers at the base.
""We have an obligation to provide for the health of [the detainees], but we're faced with a situation where we have a limited amount of vaccines at this time,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told PolitiFact. Assuming there are enough supplies, the detainees would eventually be given the vaccine, he said.
The White House told us that, to date, no prisoners have been vaccinated, but that priority for the vaccine would follow this order: U.S. forces, deployed health care workers (civilian and contractor), civilians, detainees and non-US Defense Department contractors.
So, Hannity is correct. Current plans say that the vaccines will eventually be offered to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",1,Sean Hannity
"""Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident."" A series of Internet posts that claimed outspoken rocker Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident — then was assassinated, then was faking his own death — was all fake news.
A fake news story that appeared on multiple disreputable websites on April 28, 2017 , carried a headline that read, ""Conservative icon Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident.""
Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to keep fake news out of users’ news feeds.
The story, which is fake, said Nugent was hunting from a tree stand before dawn somewhere in Montana when he was shot ""in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.""
The unnamed hunter faced manslaughter charges and was being held by state police in Boseman (which is really spelled Bozeman). But that’s not the end of the story, by a long shot.
The post originated on April 28 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked .
TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.
TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
In this case, the site followed up its own story with another fake post the same day that said Nugent actually had been killed purposely by a ""white sympathizer"" named James Alan Whitland, under the alias Alex Hayne. This story also ended up on multiple sites .
Whitland, the second post read, had been a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers and had assisted the man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016. The post said Whitland had been caught by a game warden after Nugent was killed.
Nugent and his wife Shermane posted a Facebook Live video the same day he was supposedly shot, confirming that he was alive.
But there’s more: TheLastLineOfDefense.org then posted a third item, on April 29 , saying that Nugent was actually still alive.
The third post said Nugent actually had called ""local channel WKLU NBC2"" (actually an Indianapolis-area radio station ) and made up the story and had been ""drinking iced tea at the local police station with his accomplices"" as the news hit social media.
This fake post said two Bozeman police officers had been charged with helping create the hoax and had been ""relieved of their duties."" Nugent faced a year in jail and more than $1 million in fines over the waste of resources committed to the hoax, the site said, admitting that TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled, too.
Of course, this was all fake, because the site is the outlet that made up the stories in the first place.
Our contact with the supposed creator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a person who says his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, did not reply to our email seeking comment on the ruse.
Nugent’s assistant, Linda Peterson, did reply to PolitiFact’s questions about the stories, sending a two-word email that read, ""Fake news.""
It’s apparent Nugent was not killed, nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax. The only real news about him recently is his trip to the White House on April 19.",0,Bloggers
"""China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade."" The Trump administration has cited China's trade relationship with North Korea as a key lever to deter the regime from producing a nuclear missile capable of striking the U.S.
""We must all do our share,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. Security Council April 28. ""But China, accounting for 90 percent of North Korean trade, China alone has economic leverage over Pyongyang that is unique, and its role is therefore particularly important.""
Tillerson’s remarks, which included a call for fresh economic sanctions , came at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea.
As a U.S. Navy strike group steamed toward the Korean Peninsula -- where 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea are on alert following the latest provocations from Pyongyang -- President Donald Trump on April 27 warned of a possible ""major conflict"" if diplomatic efforts fail.
We’ve previously looked at Trump’s claim about the degree of control Beijing wields over Pyongyang. With Tillerson citing Chinese-North Korean trade relations as a vital diplomatic pressure point, we decided to explore how much China accounts for North Korea’s overall trade with the outside world.
Finding accurate data for the secretive regime is a bit tricky since no North Korean equivalent of Trade.gov with troves of trade data exists, as Pyongyang treats this information as a state secret. But so-called ""mirror statistics,"" an accounting of data reconstructed from other countries’ reports, offer a workaround, albeit a flawed one, since the statistics don’t capture some transactions.
The available data tell a story of growing dependence on Chinese trade over roughly the past two decades as economic sanctions levied by the UN and individual countries, as well as other factors, have seen North Korea’s trade with other partners fall drastically.
In 2000, China, South Korea and Japan each accounted for about a fifth of the regime's overall trade, with the rest of the world making up the remaining roughly two-fifths. Since then, China’s slice of the pie has more than quadrupled, according to Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego.
""As sanctions have reduced South Korean and Japanese trade basically to nothing, trade has naturally become focused more on China,"" Haggard said. ""The rest of the world has not picked up the slack.""
Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agreed that China’s current position as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is largely a function of Pyongyang’s strained relations with its neighbor to the south -- but he noted this could change if political winds shift.
""The reason that the percentage is so high is that South Korea, which was North Korea’s second largest trade partner, imposed sanctions and trade between the two countries is virtually nil,"" Noland said. ""If South Korea were to resume trade relations (as it might in the next administration) China’s share of North Korean trade would fall, but China would still be the country’s principal trade partner.""
Bilateral disputes led to Tokyo imposing sanctions that went even further than UN restrictions, said Haggard, who noted that the commercial risk associated with North Korea and its poor record on honoring property rights have also dissuaded potential trade partners.
As South Korean and Japanese trade with Pyongyang fell, China’s economy boomed, fueling increased trade with North Korea -- a relationship unfettered by bilateral sanctions, as Beijing has traditionally viewed the regime as an ally. China has also been accused of being less compliant with UN sanctions than other countries.
As a result of these factors, the consensus among experts we spoke to is that China now accounts for roughly 90 percent of North Korean trade.
""Yes, China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s recorded trade,"" Noland said. ""They are the primary supplier of oil and the marginal supplier of grain. If China wanted to, it could bring North Korea to its knees.""
""It has the economic leverage, but has been unwilling to use it, perhaps because it fears destabilizing the regime,"" he added.",1,Rex Tillerson
"Foreign aid ""is less than 1 percent of our federal budget."" Florida has the highest percentage of senior citizens in the United States, so Social Security was one of the big topics during the March 10 Republican debate in Miami.
Most candidates spoke of how they would modify the program when discussing the balance sheet for Social Security. Donald Trump, though, suggested the United States cut back on foreign aid and other military spending in order to keep Social Security solvent.
Marco Rubio said he often hears people argue that a lot of taxpayer money can be saved by cutting back on foreign aid. That’s not reality, though.
""I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget,"" Rubio said. ""We can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.""
We wanted to fact-check whether foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the federal budget.
The amount the United States spends on foreign aid depends on who is doing the tally, as a 2011 Congressional Research Service report explained. Different agencies include different elements when they calculate what the United States spends on foreign aid. We'll use 2013 as an example, the most recent year for all four sources.
• The federal budget only includes programs that fall under the International Affairs section of the budget, specifically sections 151 and 152. It says $32.5 billion was spent in 2013.
• The U.S. Overseas Loans & Grants database, also known as the "" Greenbook ,"" developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) uses a broader definition. The latest Greenbook lists the United States as giving $31.9 billion in total economic assistance and $8 billion in total military assistance that year, for a total of $39.9 billion.
• The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of  34 developed countries, measures foreign aid by calendar year and excludes all military assistance. It says the United States spent $31.3 billion in ""official developmental assistance.""
• And the CRS has its own total that includes "" foreign operations "" plus food aid, usually found in the agriculture section of the budget. It pegged the amount at $35.74 billion.
So the range goes from $31.3 billion to $39.9 billion. On a total federal budget of just under $3.5 trillion, that's 0.9 percent to less than 1.2 percent.
In addition, we found multiple reports that put the figure in the ballpark of what Rubio mentioned.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in 2015 that ""foreign aid represents a total of 0.7 percent of the budget, or 1 percent if military aid is included. That means fully eliminating foreign aid would save only $35 billion or $40 billion per year – a very small fraction of projected annual deficits.""
That’s not much different than historical figures.
A Congressional Research Service report in 2011 stated that foreign assistance spending represents about 3 percent of the discretionary budget authority and just over 1 percent of total budget authority each year since 1977. For the 2010 fiscal year, foreign assistance totaled $39.4 billion, or 1.1 percent of the budget,
To further complicate things, these tallies usually don't include non-traditional foreign aid, where other United States agencies engage in activities that most people would put under the category of foreign aid, such a joint research on pollution in other countries conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency.
""It is estimated that these non-traditional sources of assistance equaled about $12.6 billion"" during the 2009 fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That would have raised the total actually spent on foreign aid to $47.5 billion.",1,Marco Rubio
"Says ""Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values."" A post that appears to have originated from fake news purveyors in Macedonia used a real news item from months ago to falsely say the U.S. state of Georgia has outlawed ""Muslim culture.""
A March 13, 2017, post on USANewsPost.us carried the headline, ""Georgia becomes first state to ban Muslim culture in historic move to restore Western values.""
Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fake, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to remove fake news from news feeds.
PolitiFact Georgia examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day , April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.""
The story cited an actual event — a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils . The story trumpeted the bill as being ""about keeping the American people safe.""
But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law.
State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 filed HB 3 for the 2017 legislative session. The bill aimed to expand the scope of a state law passed in 1951 that made wearing a mask a misdemeanor (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods.
Spencer’s bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in driver’s licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule the state already had .
""This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,"" Spencer told Atlanta’s WSB-TV .
The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped ""Muslim culture"" in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.)

""While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered.

"""Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum."" The full quote from a debate in Orlando, Fla. on Oct. 21, 2007. : ""In case you missed it, a few days ago, Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum. Now, my friends, I wasn't there. I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event...I was tied up at the time.""
McCain's claim is accurate.
The Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Committee Appropriations Report shows that Clinton and fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer did lobby for a $1 million earmark for the Bethel Performing Arts Center in Liberty N.Y. Clinton and Schumer intended to use the earmark for a museum located at the Performing Arts Center that would commemorate the 1969 Woodstock music festival in their state.
The Woodstock museum -- officially called the Museum at Bethel Woods -- is due to open in the spring of 2008, but without the federal money. According to a statement on Clinton's website, the $1 million in federal funds was to be used for purchasing and borrowing exhibits at the non-profit museum as well as the audio-visual presentations, computer interactive displays and films. The senator's website says the exhibits will focus on the ""post-WWII period and cultural, political, social, and significant historic events during this period including, in particular, the period of the 1960's and its continuing legacy.""
When Clinton announced the $1 million earmark for the museum on June 22, 2007, she said: ""These funds will help the for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region.""
The New York senators were successful at including the money when the bill passed the Appropriations Committee. But the full Senate then approved an amendment introduced by Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that stripped the money for the Bethel museum and instead redirected it to the Health Resources and Services Administration for the maternal and child health services program.
During Senate debate, Clinton did not defend the Woodstock project, but Schumer strongly stood up for the Bethel project as an asset for an economically struggling county.
UPDATE: McCain's campaign used his remark for a TV ad that began airing in New Hampshire a few days later.
The ad begins with psychedelic music (the Doors?) and a swirl of colors to invoke memories of Woodstock. It then shows McCain's statement from the debate interspersed with a shot of him in a North Vietnamese prison when he says he was ""tied up at the time.""",1,John McCain
"""Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth."" Hillary Clinton promised to ""connect more Latinos with good-paying jobs that pay good wages"" when she spoke on Sept. 15, 2016, at the 39th Annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Public Policy Conference and Annual Awards Gala in Washington.
""We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said . ""There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth.""
We decided to fact-check those percentages, recognizing that although the federal government considers Latino to be synonymous with Hispanic, many people make a distinction. Because we'll be using government data, we'll consider the terms comparable.
First, a bit of history.
The Great Recession had a much more devastating effect on Hispanics than on whites. The Pew Research Center found that while median wealth for whites fell 16 percent after the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent recession, it fell by 66 percent for Hispanic households.
Wealth includes all savings, investments and property, minus the value of debt, such as car loans, mortgages and credit card debt.
In 2009, median net worth for whites was $113,149. It was $6,325 for Hispanics. Four years earlier, the numbers were $134,992 for whites, $18,359 for Hispanics.
""Hispanics (were) hit hardest by the meltdown in the housing market,"" the Pew report said.
When it comes to specific percentages, the Clinton campaign sent us two two reports.
The first was from the Census Bureau , which pegged the Hispanic population at 17 percent as of July 1, 2014. That confirms the first part of Clinton's statement.
The second was a 2014 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, part of the federal reserve system. It predicts that the wealth owned by Hispanic families in total dollars will triple by 2025, although most of the extra wealth ""would result from the Hispanic population growing faster than other groups"" rather than individual Hispanics gaining more wealth.
The report uses 2010 data (when Hispanics made up 16.3 percent of the United States population). The St. Louis Fed calculated that in 2010 Hispanics represented about 2.2 percent of the total wealth in the country. That's that 2 percent Clinton was referring to.
At the time, median wealth for an Hispanic family was $15,000 versus $77,000 for the entire U.S. population.
We sought newer data by turning to Pew, where Richard Fry, a senior economist, used 2013 household data collected by the Federal Reserve.
""The nation’s total wealth was $64.7 trillion,"" he told us via email. ""The nation’s 13 million Hispanic households owned about $1.5 trillion of that $64.7 trillion, so yes, Hispanic households owned about 2 percent of the nation’s wealth in 2013.""
The actual ratio: 2.3 percent.
The current outlook for individual Hispanics is not very good.
The Fed estimated that the Hispanic share of the economy's total wealth would rise by 2025 to either 2.6 percent or 3.2 percent, depending on the projection used. But that would be because the Hispanic population is growing significantly, not because individual families would be making a lot more money.
""If it were not for the faster rate of population growth projected for the Hispanic population,"" the Fed concluded, ""the wealth shares in 2025 would be 2.0 or 2.4 percent — that is, either a small decline or a small increase from their 2010 shares. Thus, relatively rapid population growth in the Hispanic population is likely to be an important contributor to the rising share of total wealth owned by Hispanics.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Hillary Clinton ""said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true."" Several speakers touched on Hillary Clinton's email scandal at the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one. He used it to argue that ""Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America’s secrets. And then, she lied about it over and over and over again.""
""She said there was no marked classified information on her server. The FBI director said, that's untrue,"" Christie said. ""She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI director, says that's untrue. She said all-work related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true.""
For this fact-check, we'll look at Christie's claim about what happened with Clinton’s work-related emails.
Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, decided to use a private, unsecured email server at her New York home for government business. When news of the system came to light — indirectly, as part of the investigation into the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya — Clinton's lawyers went through the 60,000 or so emails she had collected to cull out personal communication.
She claimed the remaining government-related emails were turned over to the State Department.
The Clinton campaign fact sheet on the controversy says she provided copies of 30,490 emails covering over 55,000 pages.
""In providing these emails to the department,"" the fact sheet says, ""Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related — including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting — erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the department and National Archives’ determination that over 1,250 emails were 'personal' records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).""
That's in line with her statement on the April 3, 2016, edition of Meet the Press where she said, ""I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails."" (At the time, before the FBI released the results of its investigation, we gave her a Half True because more than 31,000 had been deleted by her lawyers without any government review.)
And in a Sept. 4, 2015, interview on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell, Clinton claimed that her lawyers ""went through every single email.""
Then the FBI released the results of its probe.
Director James Comey reported finding ""several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.""
Some were uncovered because they had been archived in government email accounts belonging to workers who had sent or received them. Some were discovered among the millions of fragments of emails stored in the unused space of the servers used by the Clinton system. Two emails were classified as ""confidential;"" one was classified as ""secret."" None were top secret.
But Comey also said it wasn't surprising that those work-related emails weren't turned over.
""We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,"" he said during his news conference. ""Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed.""
The FBI director also said some of the work-related emails not turned over to the State Department may have been deleted because her lawyers had not, in fact, gone through every one.
Instead, they ""relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related emails,"" he said. ""It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the (unused) slack space of a server.""
If Clinton had been using a government account like she should have, the work-related correspondence would have been archived, the FBI director said. But her system didn't do that.
When we asked the Clinton campaign about Christie's work-related email claim, spokesman Josh Schwerin noted Comey testified before Congress that three of the classified emails were not properly marked as classified, and there was no evidence that any work-related emails were intentionally deleted.",1,Chris Christie
"""After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years."" During his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama touted recent growth in manufacturing jobs.
""After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years,"" Obama said.
Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs.
A decade of decline
It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce.
Between December 1999 and December 2009 -- the decade Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.3 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had experienced ""a decade of decline"" by the time he took office. If you look at the chart (reproduced above) the downward slope is essentially uninterrupted.
Half a million manufacturing jobs created
During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to July 2012 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 532,000. That’s ""over half a million manufacturing jobs,"" as Obama put it.
It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the ""decade of decline."" The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline.",1,Barack Obama
"Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. It would be an understatement to say that voters in the recently completed midterm elections didn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy about incumbents on the ballot this year -- even about the ones they voted for. According to the 2014 exit poll of voters, 59 percent of those who voted said they weren’t happy with Republican leadership in Congress, even as they were handing control of the Senate to the GOP.
A meme making its way around social media, sent to PolitiFact by a reader, captured the frustration many Americans felt. The meme said, ""11% approval ratings. 96.4% re-elected"" -- in other words, Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. The text was superimposed over a photograph of the House chamber in the Capitol.
We wondered whether that was true, so we took a look.
Does Congress have 11 percent approval ratings?
While the meme features a picture of the House chamber, the most common polling question refers to Congress generally, rather than the House specifically, so we looked at Congress’ approval ratings overall. We found congressional approval scores from October 2014 from five different pollsters on the poll-archive website PollingReport.com :
• Fox News: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the job Congress is doing?"" 13 percent said ""approve.""
• CBS News: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?"" 14 percent said ""approve.""
• CNN/ORC: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?"" 13 percent said ""approve.""
• ABC News/Washington Post: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way the U.S. Congress is doing its job?"" 20 percent said ""approve.""
• NBC News/Wall Street Journal: ""In general, do you approve or disapprove of the job that Congress is doing?"" 12 percent said ""approve.""
That averages out to 14 percent -- slightly higher than 11 percent, but in the same, miserable ballpark.
Were 96.4 percent of congressional incumbents re-elected?
To be consistent with the polling, which covers Congress broadly, we’ll lump together the incumbent winning percentages in both the House and Senate. There are a few contests still to be decided, but there are enough settled that we can make a pretty close count.
In the House, we counted 390 incumbents who ran on Election Day. Of those, four haven’t had their races called as of Nov. 10, so we’ll set them aside. Of the remaining 386 incumbents, 373 won, for a winning percentage of 96.6 percent.
If you add in three incumbents who ran but lost in primaries, the incumbent winning percentage drops to 95.9 percent.
Meanwhile, in the Senate, 23 out of 26 incumbents won, with one more (Alaska’s Mark Begich, a Democrat) trailing in a race that has not yet been called, and another (Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu, also a Democrat) heading into a runoff.
If you don’t include Begich and Landrieu, the combined House-Senate incumbent winning percentage is 95.4 percent. If you do include them, it falls slightly to 95 percent.
All of these percentages are exceedingly close to the meme’s stated 96.4 percent, and they’re a moving target due to late-called races. So we won’t quibble.",1,Facebook posts
"""Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards."" An online website that describes itself as ""free independent news"" is pushing a false story that a Las Vegas shooting victim saw multiple gunmen dressed as security guards at Mandalay Bay.
One of the more pervasive conspiracy-minded claims spinning around the Internet is that the Las Vegas shooting was some type of staged attack or that there were multiple gunmen. As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true.
However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported ""multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.""
""As the mainstream media in the US attempts to lock down the ‘crazy lone wolf gunman’ narrative for the devastating shooting attack in Las Vegas, the truth has started to seep through foreign news outlets who don't follow the same political agenda as the American MSM,"" the post , dated Oct. 3, 2017, reads.
The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter.
The story talks about an Oct. 2 interview Hodge gave to the  Courier Mail , an Australian tabloid. In that article, Hodge said he hid in the bushes outside the casino hotel until police arrived.
""There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us,"" Hodge is quoted as saying.
Later, Hodge said: ""My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.""
While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that’s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he’d have any way of knowing.
In fact, Hodge gave an interview to the  Sydney Morning Herald  in which he more fully describes what he saw.
Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside.
""I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn't know where they were... I didn't want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life.""
Hodge also posted on Facebook, ""There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes.""
More importantly for this fact-check, it’s clear to us the Neon Nettle post puts words in Hodge’s mouth. Hodge never said in the Courier Mail article nor in any other article or social media post that the security guard was a shooter.
And he also disputed saying shooters.",0,Bloggers
"""A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton."" A story online that says a witness will speak out against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of a larger investigation into her actions is a muddled mix of real developments misleadingly retold.
""Breaking: A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton,"" read the headline on a July 30, 2017, post on CoffeeBreakForYou.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.
The post said that Clinton would be ""held accountable for the many wrongdoings she has been charged with,"" although it never specifies what those charges may be. It said President Donald Trump had tasked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton’s ties to Russia.
That’s where the ""key witness"" comes in.
""Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years,"" the post read. ""Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels.""
The CoffeeBreakForYou.com article said the Senate Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed Simpson. The post asked readers whether they thought Simpson ""will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump.""
The story appears to have originated as a July 30 post on Conservative101.com. The byline on the post was Christopher Reynolds. We attempted to reach Conservative101.com through the website’s contact form (the only method of contact available) but didn’t get a response.
The story isn't fake in the sense that it makes up all its content, but it does spin things to the point of being misleading or incorrect. The most notable issues are whether Clinton is really being investigated, and for what reasons the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to talk to Simpson.
Trump has publicly criticized Sessions for failing to investigate Clinton for deleting emails from her private server and for allegedly getting information from Ukraine during her presidential campaign.
The Justice Department has not publicly acknowledged an investigation into Clinton, although the Senate Judiciary Committee has demanded the agency disclose if it’s investigating the Ukrainian allegations . The Justice Department has until Aug. 3 to respond. House Republicans have requested FBI documents into the campaign investigation and have asked for a special counsel for a Clinton probe.
The Senate committee has been looking into the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election.
Simpson is a real person. He is a former journalist who is a founding partner of opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Simpson was initially being subpoenaed for a hearing , but not explicitly to expose Clinton. The committee wanted to compel him to discuss details of his company’s Trump dossier, which became public in January 2017.
Simpson wanted to protect the Democratic-leaning client who hired Fusion GPS to create the Trump dossier, according to the Daily Beast .
Simpson had originally intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, but struck a deal in which he would provide a transcribed interview . The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed and withdrew its subpoena .
We couldn’t find any proof that Simpson was ""friends with the Clinton family,"" although the New York Post reported that Fusion GPS was ""actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda.""
But trying to protect the identity of a Clinton ally who paid for opposition research against Trump is not the same as testifying against Clinton.
In addition to the Trump opposition report, Fusion GPS also had reportedly worked to ease sanctions against Russia , through ties with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya . She’s the same lawyer Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had met in a controversial and previously undisclosed 2016 meeting.",0,Bloggers
"Says Virginia Del. Mark Cole ""wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom."" A left-leaning advocacy group says Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia.
""Virginia Republican wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom,"" read the headline of a Jan. 12 web post by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - ""counterbalance the Republican Tea Party.""
The ensuing article elaborated that Cole’s bill ""would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their ‘anatomical sex.’""
Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: The Raw Story and Peacock Panache , triggering some Internet debate that isn’t exactly flattering to Cole.
We wondered whether the description of Cole’s bill is accurate.
School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole’s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student’s use of a girls’ lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school.
Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls’ room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys’ restroom.
Cole’s bill would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room ""designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation."" The legislation defines ""anatomical sex"" as the ""physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person’s anatomy.""
That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student’s gender.
Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group’s founder, told us in an email that the group ""simply took Del. Mark Cole’s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion.""
""How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual's anatomical sex matches Del. Cole's interpretation of binary gender designation?"" they wrote. ""Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.’""
But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently noted , there’s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor’s note, Snopes said.
To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student’s ""biological sex"" by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student.
Cole issued a written statement Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can’t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district.
""Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks,"" Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student’s choice of bathrooms. ""If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate,"" he wrote.
Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections.
""It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search,"" Cole said.",0,Occupy Democrats
"""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy.
Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change ""have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.""
We wondered whether Murphy’s polling data was sound.
Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy’s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election.
The poll asked, ""Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?"" Here are the responses:
• Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent
• Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent
• Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent
• Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent
• Don't know: 3 percent
This appears to support Murphy’s claim.
We should note a few quibbles.
• The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it’s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible.
• On a subsequent question in the same poll -- ""When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?"" -- the number answering ""never"" was 6 percent. That’s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things.
• There’s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren’t exactly comparable.
The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: ""From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?""
Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent.
Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from ""registered voters … who voted in the 2012 general election,"" while the Pew poll simply asked ""adults."" This means the poll results aren’t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion.
This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said ""3 percent of voters"" -- not ""3 percent of Americans."" So we don’t find fault on these grounds.
""Pollsters don’t ask about climate change very often,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high.""",1,Chris Murphy
"""Dwayne 'The Rock' (Johnson) Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign"" It’s never too early on social media to stir up interest about the next presidential election in 2020 -- especially if the buzz features a potential candidate who’s a bona fide celebrity.
On Aug. 9, Rearfront.com -- a viral-content website that describes itself as a ""powerhouse of generating awesomeness"" -- posted an item headlined about former pro wrestler and popular actor Dwayne Johnson, sometimes known as ""the Rock.""
It said: ""Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign And Twitter Is Already Going Crazy.""
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post had attracted 16,700 views through Aug. 11. So we decided to take a closer look.
As it turns out, the headline and some of the text in the article offered a garbled account of what had actually happened.
Johnson, reportedly an independent, has indeed flirted with making a presidential run in 2020, though it remains to be seen how serious his is about a bid. In May, when he hosted the season finale of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, Johnson joined with fellow actor Tom Hanks under a large banner reading ""Johnson Hanks 2020"" as confetti flooded the stage.
Johnson talked about the growing buzz about a candidacy with GQ writer Caity Weaver in June 2017.
Weaver wrote: ""Johnson doesn't hesitate when I ask him whether he honestly might one day give up his life as the highest-paid movie star on earth — which is unquestionably easier, more fun, and more lucrative than being president of the United States — in order to run for office. 'I think that it's a real possibility,’ he says solemnly.""
Then someone took it seriously and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission -- but contrary to the Rearfront.com article, it wasn’t Johnson.
On July 9, Kenton Tilford of Wheeling, W. Va., filed paperwork to formally establish ""Run The Rock 2020."" It is what’s known as a draft committee -- an organization created ""solely to draft an individual or to encourage him or her to become a candidate for federal office,"" according to the Federal Election Commission .
The paperwork says that the committee supports ""only one candidate … Dwayne Douglas Johnson.""
Where the Rearfront.com item gets it wrong is when it says that Johnson himself has ""officially filed"" as a 2020 presidential candidate.
That is flatly wrong.
The paperwork itself clarifies Run the Rock 2020 ""is NOT an Authorized Committee,"" meaning that it was not established by the candidate being supported.
The Run the Rock 2020 website offers T-shirts for $20.20 to fund its grassroots effort.
Tilford confirmed to PolitiFact that the Rearfront.com post ""is indeed incorrect.""
""I have not been in touch with Mr. Johnson or his representatives,"" Tilford told PolitiFact. ""I'm simply a private citizen who formed a draft committee to rally like-minded people around the goal of encouraging him to run. As far as I know, Mr. Johnson and his representatives have not commented on the matter. We filed paperwork with the FEC because we hope to raise money and develop a real presence to show him the energy on the ground for his candidacy.""
That explanation squares with what Tilford had earlier told several other news outlets that he has not talked to Johnson himself.
According to his LinkedIn page , Tilford graduated from Knox College in 2012 and has worked on campaigns in New Jersey and Louisiana. He was also a field organizer for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign in Clayton County, Iowa.
We did not hear back from two representatives of Johnson’s camp.",0,Rearfront.com
"""Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground"" The Swedes are fed up with the ""Muslim invasion"" in their country and have fought back with fire, according to a news account on Facebook.
""Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground,"" states the headline in Pipo News , which linked to a similar 2015 article in JewsNews , a fake news website . We found no contact information on the Pipo News website.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story and the photo are misleading. However, Muslim refugees have been the targets of suspected arson attacks in Sweden in recent years.
Pipo News states that the multiple arsons have been at facilities that house or are slated to house immigrants.
But the photo is actually a of a fire of a recycling station in Malmo Sweden in 2013, our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted in 2015.
Pipo News cites arson incidents at a children’s summer camp in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna that planned to host asylum seekers and in a refugee center in the town of Munkedal.
Fires did occur in those two towns, according to credible news articles.
On Christmas Day in 2014, five people were injured in a fire in a mosque in Eskilstuna, near Stockholm, which the authorities also suspect may have been arson, the New York Times reported. (Nothing in the New York Times stated that the site was a children’s camp.)
Reuters reported in November 2015 that in the town of Munkedal, a center housing 14 asylum seekers went up in flames.
""The Munkedal blaze was just one of more than a dozen at centers across Sweden in the past month -- some confirmed as arson attacks and others suspected as such -- that the police are struggling to solve as the country expects to take in up to a record 190,000 asylum seekers this year,"" Reuters reported.
The fires occurred while a far-right anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, was gaining more traction, the New York Times wrote in 2015. Sweden had previously been known as a welcoming country for refugees, but that philosophy was tested as an influx of refugees strained government services.
Omar Mustafa, president of the Islamic Association of Sweden, told the New York Times in January 2015 that the fires at mosques followed a year of rising anti-Islamic attacks which included vandalism of mosques.
''It is a scary development in Swedish society,'' Mustafa said. ''It is a big movement that is moving from the Internet to the real world.''
Suspected arson incidents have continued in 2017 at Sweden's largest Shiite Muslim mosque and a mosque near Stockholm .
While the Pipo News article gives the impression that Muslim immigration has led to civil war, Reuters reported in 2015 that opinion polls showed most Swedes supported welcoming refugees.
Pew Research Center surveyed European views of refugees in 2016 and found that in Sweden 57 percent were concerned that refugees would increase terrorism in their country, slightly above the median among the 10 countries surveyed.
But of the 10 countries, Sweden had the lowest percentage that viewed refugees from Syria and Iraq as a major threat.",0,Pipo News
"""More than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women."" On news of the stock market hitting an all-time high, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it’s time to raise the minimum wage.
In a news conference on March 7, 2013, Pelosi, D-Calif., announced her support for a bill raising the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour.
""If we are to honor our commitment to a middle class, which is the backbone of our democracy, we have to reflect ... that intention in our public policy,"" she said.
Then she added, ""It is important to note in this Women's History Month, that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women. So this has a big impact on the financial security of our women.""
A reader asked us on Facebook about the statistic -- that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women. We thought it was an interesting fact to check, and it turns out Pelosi is right.
The best source for this information is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. BLS figures show there were slightly more than 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, and nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. So dividing the total by the women workers gets you to 64.4 percent.
It’s interesting to note, however, that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working --  in this case, 2.6 percent of working women.",1,Nancy Pelosi
"Says a Washington Post reporter is ""calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore"" for up to $7,000. A person purporting to be a Washington Post reporter left a voicemail on an Alabama phone number offering up to $7,000 to women willing to malign Republican senate nominee Roy Moore.
The Nov. 14 message was received by Pastor Al Moore of Creola, Ala., who played the recording for local CBS affiliate WKRG . The news outlet described the message as a ""robocall"" and said ""at least one person in our viewing area"" received the message. (They did not respond when we asked how many people had received the call.)
""Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000 dollars,"" the message stated.
The caller then said the newspaper ""will not be fully investigating these claims"" but would make a written report, and said he could be contacted via email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com.
This voicemail smelled fishy to us — so we decided to investigate further. It turns out the call was a hoax that appears calculated to undermine the work of real journalists.
Voicemail comes on heels of Washington Post report
The suspicious voicemail comes as top Republicans call for Moore to end his bid in the Dec. 12 special election after the Washington Post reported that Moore, while in his 30s, had sexual encounters with several teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, according to the women. Since then, another accuser has alleged that Moore assaulted her in locked car when she was 16.
Moore’s attorney, Trenton Garmon, seized on the phone call during a Nov. 15 appearance on MSNBC and floated the possibility of pursuing legal action.
""Robocalls are now even being made asking for people to come forward against Roy, which I think is kind of an indication of the political climate that we're in, and we plan on even probably getting into some depositions related to that,"" said Garmon, who acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for making the call.
Washington Post's denial
It’s unclear what relationship, if any, the voicemail bears to the Nov. 9 Washington Post report concerning Moore’s alleged sexual encounters.
But for his part, Moore forcefully denied the allegations and threatened to sue the Post after their bombshell investigation led top Republicans to call for Moore’s exit.
""The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign,"" he said at a Nov. 12 campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala. ""These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued.""
The Moore campaign did not respond to our request to comment on this story.
Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron dismissed the voicemail as an effort to ""discredit real journalism,"" saying the reporting methods described in the call bear ""no relationship to reality.""
""The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post,"" Baron said in a written statement. ""The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism.""
The Washington Post further noted in a Nov. 15 article that no Post newsroom employees are named ""Bernie Bernstein"" or ""Al Bernstein."" Additionally, Moore, the pastor who received the voicemail, told WKRG that his attempt to email the address provided in the message came back undeliverable.

"President Donald Trump ""announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with."" A fake news story is tricking people into thinking that President Barack Obama canceled a national day of remembrance for fallen police officers.
""Obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. Not anymore,"" reads a post on theexaminer.site that we also found on guerilla.news .
""President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with,"" the story continues.
The story then allegedly quotes Trump as saying, ""Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.""
However, the Trump quote is fabricated, as is the premise of the story.
The national day of remembrance for police officers killed in the line of the duty currently falls on May 15 each year. It is called Peace Officers Memorial Day.
Obama did not cancel the day, and Trump did not reinstate it.
It was started in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy as part of "" police week .""  It has been celebrated by presidents -- including Obama and Trump -- ever since.
Obama made remarks at a memorial service in May 2013, honoring the death of Jupiter, Fla., motorcycle police officer Bruce St. Laurent , who was struck and killed as part of a presidential motorcade in September 2012.
""I have the privilege of working with some of the nation’s finest law enforcement officers and professionals every day,"" Obama said . ""And I’m perpetually mindful of the sacrifices they make for me and for my family, and for other leaders and visiting dignitaries, but never more so than when I was told that Officer St. Laurent was struck and killed by another vehicle while driving his motorcycle as part of my motorcade.""
Obama also spoke at a memorial service in May 2015.
""We are here to honor heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty -- men and women who put themselves in the way of danger, so that the rest of us could live in safety,"" Obama said in 2015. ""They were beat cops, deputies, detectives, correctional and forest service officers, federal agents and tribal police.  But to many here today, they went by different titles:  caring husband, loving wife, my son, my daughter, Mom, Dad.
We also found electronic copies of the proclamations Obama signed designating ""police week"" in 2014 , 2015 and 2016 .
Trump, like other presidents, continued the tradition in 2017 . He spoke at a memorial service but did not mention Obama.
""America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them,"" Trump said . ""We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals.  We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else.""

"""The day President Obama took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon."" During the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered a line she has used frequently in the past: ""The day that President Obama took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon."" She added that ""it's entirely possible for us to get back to inexpensive energy.""
With regular unleaded gasoline now hovering around $3.60 per gallon nationally, a number of readers wondered whether Bachmann was right on the price when Obama was inaugurated. So we looked into it.
We turned to historical data collected by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department.
The interactive database offers a variety of measurements, so we’ll cite a few of them here. We’ll use the third week of January 2009 as a stand-in for Jan. 20, the day Obama was sworn in.
Here are the average prices in several categories that week, rounded to the nearest cent:
• Conventional retail gasoline , regular unleaded, national average: $1.83 per gallon
• Reformulated retail gasoline , regular unleaded, national average: $1.88 per gallon
• Gasoline retail prices , regular unleaded, national city average: $1.79
So using one of these measures Bachmann is entirely correct and with the others she’s close.
Of course, the national average is the most obvious way to analyze this issue, but there is usually variation by region. During the week in question, the cost of a gallon of unleaded ranged from a high of $2.00 on the west coast to a low of $1.61 in the Rocky Mountain states.
It's also worth noting that a president's ability to affect gasoline prices is limited. ""Other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil,"" said John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association.
As recently as early 2009, a gallon of gasoline cost half what it cost today, which may be hard to remember, given the recent run of high prices. But it did cost that little.",1,Michele Bachmann
"Says Tampa Bay Lightning hockey player J.T. Brown was ""fired after raising fist during national anthem."" We can’t say exactly how many living, breathing people believed the article that the Tampa Bay Lightning fired hockey forward J.T. Brown, but whether it was humans or bots, they shared the story more than 20,000 times. That was enough to flag it on Facebook’s fake news list.
A website called Conservative7.com ran a story with the headline, ""Black hockey player fired after raising fist during national anthem,"" on Oct. 10. It was a copy and paste job from a site called FreedomJunkshun.com, which first ran the story on Oct. 9 .
FreedomJunkshun.com is part of a group of sites run by liberal trolls who write absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservatives .
The site runs the disclaimer that it ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth."" The warning goes on to say, ""All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.""
That nuance got lost in translation.
According to the story, ""J.T. Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the ‘hate our troops’ bandwagon and made a ‘black power’ fist,"" as the national anthem played before a game. The result was swift, the article continued.
The team owner, ""Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.""
What’s true here is that Brown did raise his fist before a Sept. 28 game against the Florida Panthers.
Beyond that, the article is pure invention.
Brown told the  Tampa Bay Times  that after a lot of discussion with friends in the military, teammates and coaches, he ""wanted to show my support for the root of the protest, talking about police brutality and inequality.""
During the game, the Lightning released a statement, ""The Tampa Bay Lightning celebrate the moment before every game when we can unite as a community, paying homage to a flag that is representative of our nation and those who have sacrificed. At the same time, we respect our players and individual choices they may make on social and political issues.""
In another bit of fantasy, the team owner is Jeff Vinik , not Burt Lancaster , a name more tied to Hollywood than hockey.
Lastly, we checked the team roster
.
Brown is still on it. Brown was a healthy scratch for the Lightning’s last game, Saturday against Pittsburgh.
Brown hasn't played since Oct. 7. But that likely has more to do with him being the 12th/13th forward on a team that has typically played just 11 .
Brown has said that he will not continue his protest, ""I am done raising my fist during the national anthem. I am now using this support, opportunity and platform to call out everyone who agreed or disagreed with me to help by sharing suggestions, continuing respectful conversations and looking for ways that they, too, can make a difference in the community.""",0,Bloggers
"Heroin comes in the United States ""from the southern border."" Donald Trump tied the heroin epidemic gripping suburban white communities to the issue central to the campaign: border security and illegal immigration.
The rate of heroin-related overdoses has nearly quadrupled between 2002 and 2013, with more than 8,200 deaths that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Appearing on CNBC, Trump argued that this too is tied to weak borders.
""Our youth is being poisoned. You go to places like New Hampshire, where it’s the No. 1 thing, heroin, and it comes from the southern border. And you go to Ohio, as an example, I was there two days ago, and the biggest complaint they have is what’s pouring into there,"" Trump said , before repeating his False claim that Hillary Clinton ""is for open borders.""
We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border?
Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.
""Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand,"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 .
""Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States,"" the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. ""Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons.""
Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border:
As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades.
In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves.
Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact.
This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico.
From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer.
In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer.
""The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends,"" he said.
Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast.
Here’s a map from the Justice Department that shows how heroin moves through the United States:",1,Donald Trump
"""BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica."" The public has been misled by climate change advocates about the real reason behind the melting of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, claims the website American News.
""BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica,"" states a Nov. 8 headline .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We emailed American News but did not get a reply.
The American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate.
Here’s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, ""Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions,"" was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.
According to the NASA press release, the study ""adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctic Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet.""
The heat source isn’t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable.
Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept.
The American News story used an actual quote from the NASA press release by the first author of the study, Hélène Seroussi. When she first heard the idea, she said, ""I thought it was crazy. I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it.""
To study the concept, NASA scientists used a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets  to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes.
Mantle plumes are thought to be narrow streams of hot rock rising through Earth's mantle and spreading out like a mushroom cap under the crust, NASA wrote.
The Marie Byrd Land mantle plume formed 50 million to 110 million years ago, long before the West Antarctic ice sheet came into existence, NASA wrote.
""At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today,"" NASA said.
Erik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn’t address climate change.
""The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years,"" he said. ""We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales.""
The NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise
""This study doesn’t discredit that,"" he says. ""Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change.""
We interviewed a few experts on climate change including Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central, a news organization that focuses on climate change.
""It merely suggests the presence of a natural contributor to West Antarctic ice sheet melt and instability,"" he says. ""It does not prove that this is the only factor. It does not state that it explains all of West Antarctic mass loss. Saying that a natural heat source disproves any effect of human-caused climate change is just as ridiculous as saying that natural moonlight disproves illumination from a streetlamp.""",0,AmericanNews.com
"Says Roy Moore said a ""practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith."" Until allegations of sexual misconduct emerged, the worst criticism that Roy Moore heard from Republicans in the Senate centered on his views about Islam.
Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was one of just two GOP senators who condemned Moore, the party’s Senate nominee in Alabama.
""When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong,"" Flake said Oct. 31 on the Senate floor. ""That this same judge is now my party’s nominee for the Senate should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress.""
Moore is known for many strong stands, including opposing homosexual marriage and defying a court ruling to remove a display of the 10 Commandments from his courtroom.
But did he say that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress simply because of his faith?
He did, back in 2006.
That year, Moore wrote an op-ed for the website WorldNetDaily.com. Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Moore said Ellison’s faith had no place in the government of the United States because the ""Islamic philosophy (is) directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution.""
""The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god, Allah,"" Moore wrote Dec. 13, 2006 . ""Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on ‘Mein Kampf,’ or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the ‘Communist Manifesto.’ Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!""
As far as we can tell, Moore did not take up the issue again. That is, until he was criticized for it by Flake, which Flake first did during an exchange with a Washington Post reporter on Oct. 26 .
Soon after that, at an event in Decatur, Ala., a reporter asked Moore if a Muslim could serve in federal office.
""Of course they can serve,"" Moore said Oct. 28 . ""But they understand what they swear the Bible on, they swear to on the Bible, is the God that is not of their faith.""
Moore had shifted his position, but how much remains unclear.
On Oct. 31, the same day Flake spoke, Moore was on Capitol Hill. An MSNBC reporter asked him if he still thought Ellison should be ousted from Congress.
""Read my article and you’ll find out what I believe,"" Moore said . ""It’s clarified very clearly in my article.""
Since Ellison's election, André Carson, D-Ind., became the second Muslim member of Congress.

"""Facebook picks sides in Alabama Senate race ... shuts down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart reports on discredited Allred accuser"" On Friday, we rated as Pants on Fire a misleading headline on a blog about a statement made by a woman who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct.
The headline on The Gateway Pundit read, ""WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO).""
But Beverly Young Nelson, who accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16, never said she tampered with his signature or forged the inscription in her high school yearbook.
""He wrote the note and signed his name,"" Nelson told ABC News . ""I had wrote under it where it happened at.""
Allred, Nelson’s lawyer, clarified Nelson had added the ""D.A. 12 -22-77 Olde Hickory House"" to the note that read, ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore.""
The most recent Gateway Pundit headline on the Nelson story was equally misleading.
""Facebook Picks Sides in Alabama Senate Race=> Shuts Down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart Reports on Discredited Allred Accuser,"" the Gateway Pundit wrote in their headline.
""The far left website Politifact said our story was not accurate and Facebook (then) shut it down,"" the post said. ""No one will be able to see our story on Facebook.""
After we rated the story as Pants on Fire, Facebook â€‹flagged our report for its users as part of its effort to combat fake news. But both the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit articles are still searchable.
We found them by scrolling down the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit Facebook pages. The claim that no one will be able to see the story on Facebook is flat-out wrong.
Unless an article violates Facebook’s community standards, it’s not removed.
Facebook does, however, downrank disputed articles. That means they are pushed lower down on users’ newsfeeds, although the severity of downranking varies.
When a user tries to share the original Gateway Pundit story through Facebook, a pop-up appears saying ""Before you share this content, you might want to know that there is additional reporting on this from PolitiFact."" A hyperlink that says ""Visit PolitiFact"" redirects the sharer to our report. But if the user clicks Continue, they are able to share the story as usual.
If a person reading the story through the Gateway Pundit website tries to share the content to Facebook, the pop-up window never appears. The same applies for Breitbart.
Facebook does this for every story flagged as false.
""Our take on facts is that objective facts are objective facts, and their political provenance is irrelevant,"" Facebook spokesman Todd Breasseale said. ""It doesn’t matter if an objective fact was discovered or made apparent by a politically conservative organization or a politically liberal or an apolitical organization.""

"Says ""Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video."" A series of fake news articles saying rapper Snoop Dogg was arrested for encouraging people to shoot President Donald Trump are all fabricated, and can be traced back to one website.
Snoop, born Calvin Broadus, drew fire of his own for pretending to shoot a clown resembling Trump (named Ronald Klump, for subtlety’s sake) with a toy gun that released a flag that read ""BANG"" in his video for the song ""Lavender,"" released March 12.
You can watch the video here if you don’t mind, um, colorful language.
By March 14, the Internet was filled with versions of a post on various websites saying Snoop had suffered the consequences , most with headlines that read, ""Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video.""
Several of these posts were flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, which they are.
The posts, almost all of which appear to copy each other, say Snoop wasn’t arrested specifically because of the video. Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, ""I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun.""
The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail.
To be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan — he called the president a ""clown"" in a Billboard interview — and the video for ""Lavender"" does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive. But Snoop did not say he hoped someone shot Trump.
As is the case with several other claims we’ve checked before , this post originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org. They posted the story on March 14.
The site doesn’t identify the Obama story as fake, but its About Us page notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
None of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either. But the post has been shared tens of thousands of times via various websites.
Trump, who boasted as a presidential candidate , ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,"" tweeted to decry the content of the video:
Like all presidents, Obama did face death threats, although it’s tough to say just how many .
At least one other official also decried the imagery of the president with a gun to his head. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told TMZ.com on March 13 that ""Snoop shouldn’t have done that.""
""We’ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about,"" Rubio said, adding that if the ""wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem.""
The Secret Service did tell TheWrap.com on March 14 that they were ""aware"" of Snoop’s video. But it doesn’t appear they’re hauling him off to prison over his comments. It is a federal crime to threaten the president , but such actions have to be substantial and credible enough to meet the level of a "" true threat .""
The First Amendment allows a lot of leeway for criticism , and Snoop Dogg is hardly the only recording artist to signal his distaste for Trump. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, for example, released a video teaser in November 2016 for his new album Say10, in which he beheads a man dressed suspiciously similar to Trump.
Snoop Dogg’s reaction since has been limited to a March 15 Instagram video in which he said he’s ""got nothing to say, mate.""
He hasn’t been arrested for his video or for talking about it, despite what the fake reports say.",0,Bloggers
"Under Donald Trump's tax plan, ""51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up."" Campaigning in the final stretch of the presidential election, Hillary Clinton took a brief break from knocking Donald Trump’s character to hammer his tax plan.
""He's taking care of himself, he's taking care of his family, he's taking care of the super wealthy and corporations,"" Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Nov. 4, 2016, adding that under Trump, ""51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up.""
Briefly, Trump’s tax plan would collapse the seven federal income tax brackets into three (12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent). He would also raise the standard deduction (the amount everyone can deduct from taxable income) but repeal personal exemptions and head of household filing status.
Tax analysts have found that Trump’s plan would deliver, on average, tax cuts across all income brackets. So how is it possible that single parents would pay more?
The Clinton campaign referred us to analysis of Trump’s tax plan from the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the left-leaning Urban Institute.
According to the report, authored by New York University professor Lily Batchelder, about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would wind up paying more in federal taxes.
How?
First, Trump’s proposal to increase the standard deduction wouldn’t be enough to offset the amount many single parents could have deducted with personal exemptions (which Trump would take away).
For example, a single mother with one child can take a $9,350 standard deduction and two $4,050 exemptions, one for herself and one for her child in 2017 under the current system — or $17,450 in exemptions in total. Under Trump’s plan, she would be able to take just a $15,000 standard deduction. The end result? That mother would have to pay income tax on an additional $2,450 under Trump’s plan.
Second, the head of household filing status currently applies to unmarried filers with dependents, and their standard deduction and tax rates are between those of married filers and single filers. Repealing this provision as Trump proposes would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates.
Third, Trump’s three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers. For example, the current lowest bracket is 10 percent, but Trump’s lowest bracket is 12 percent.
""For example, in 2017 a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25 percent tax rate on adjusted gross income between $53,050 and $68,550, compared with just a 15 percent rate under current law,"" Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in Forbes.
Put it altogether, 51 percent of single parents or about 5.8 million households would see a tax increase under Trump’s plan, Batchelder calculated. As our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted , ""single parents tend to do worse under Trump’s plan than under current law.""
For example, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see his or her taxes increase by $2,440 or by $1,640 if the family had child care costs that could be deducted under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder. Similarly, a single parent making $50,000 and who had three children would face an increase of $1,188.
The Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank, has not released similar analysis. But its director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder’s report.

"Says Donald Trump’s proposed tax treatment of hedge fund managers ""makes the current loophole even worse."" Hillary Clinton is attacking Donald Trump’s tax plan , saying it actually benefits the hedge fund managers Trump had promised to cut down to size.
""Now, before releasing his plan, Trump said, ‘Hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.’ And he added, ‘They’ll pay more,’ "" Clinton said. ""Then his plan came out. And it actually makes the current loophole even worse.
""It gives hedge-fund managers a special tax rate that’s lower than what many middle-class families pay,"" Clinton continued in the June 21, 2016, speech . ""And I did have to look twice because I didn’t believe it. Under Donald Trump’s plan, these Wall Street millionaires will pay a lower tax rate than many working people.""
Trump’s plan does roll back one high-profile advantage for hedge fund partners. Is Clinton right to say they still come out ahead?
Trump took an aggressive position on tax rates for hedge fund managers during his fight for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS in August, Trump called them ""paper pushers"" who ""did not build this country."" In a Republican debate in September, Trump said his tax plan would make them pay more.
""The hedge fund guys won’t like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they’ll pay more,"" Trump said.
After the Republican debate, Trump released the outline of his tax plan .
Trump’s plan eliminates the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows general partners in private investment firms (including most hedge fund managers) to treat some of their income as income from investments, or capital gains, subject to a top tax rate of 23.8 percent, instead of the much higher tax rate for ordinary income (43.4 percent).
Under Trump’s plan, income from carried interest would no longer be treated as capital gains. Tax rates for ordinary income tops out at 25 percent under Trump’s plan. This looks like a hike in line with Trump’s promises.
Except.
Along with private equity and venture capital funds, many hedge funds are structured as partnerships. Under Trump’s plan, income through a business partnership is taxed at a rate of no more than 15 percent, significantly less than the 23.8 percent they previously paid, according to an analysis of Trump’s tax plan from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
Eliminating the carried interest ""loophole"" actually helps these hedge fund managers under Trump’s plan. If carried interest was still treated as capital gains, it could be taxed at the top rate for capital gains in the plan (20 percent), higher than the fixed 15 percent tax for partnership income.
Trump’s plan presents the discounted rate for partnership income as a way to help ""the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy.""
It also helps large businesses and wealthy financiers who structure their businesses as partnerships, including the hedge funds managers he attacked in his campaign.
Clinton also said that rates for hedge fund managers would be lower than for middle-class families under Trump’s plan. Defining the middle class can be tricky, but in the Pew Research Center’s range of $42,000 to $125,000 for a household of three in 2014, a substantial number of middle-class households would make enough to qualify for a marginal tax rate of more than 15 percent if Trump’s plan were enacted.
Not all of these people would pay more than 15 percent overall, according to Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center, and it would be difficult to say how many middle-income people would pay more than hedge fund managers once the many different variables involved played out. But some would, Williams wrote in an email.
In May, Politico reported that the Trump campaign had engaged two economists to craft a new tax plan. The Trump campaign has not confirmed whether they plan to re-write their tax plan, and did not respond to Politico’s request for comment. The tax plan announced in September remains on Trump's website, and is the basis of this article.

"""President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent."" Shortly after General Motors filed for bankruptcy, a plan that will involve significant government ownership of the auto company, Republicans went into attack mode.
The General Motors restructuring plan ""is nothing more than another government grab of a private company and another handout to the union cronies who helped bankroll his presidential campaign,"" said Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele in a statement accompanying a newly minted ad. ""President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent. And what do the taxpayers get? They’ll get stuck with up to a $50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM.""
In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it has $172.81 billion in debt and $82.29 billion in assets — all that despite a $20 billion General Motors has already received from the government, money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks.
Now, the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is ""tailored to the realities of today's auto market,"" said Obama. It's ""a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars.""
So, there's no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors — it has already shelled out $20 billion in loans — but is Steele correct about the government's new financial ties to the ailing company?
We assume that by referring to President Obama owning 60 percent of the automaker, Steele means that the government as a whole will own that stake under the restructuring plan. In fact, the White House was the first to state this fact, during a May 31 briefing with reporters. By the administration's own words, the RNC is correct on this point.
Steele goes on to say that Obama's ""union buddies will own almost 20 percent."" To be exact, the United Auto Workers will get 17.5 percent of General Motor's common stock, plus cash to help pay for a $20 billion health care trust fund for retirees. Whether this is a boon to Obama's ""union buddies,"" as Steele's statement says, is a matter of opinion. However, it's worth noting that the UAW endorsed Obama for president and spent more than $4 million to assist his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
So Steele is right that the administration will have a 60 percent ownership in the new General Motors and that the union will have nearly 20 percent. Steele earns a True.",1,Michael Steele
"""Some politicians … want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries."" Along with Doritos and Bud Lite commercials on Super Bowl Sunday, viewers in the Washington area saw a political ad against taxes on food and soft drinks. We wondered if the ad was correct that politicians are seeking to tax sodas and food, so we decided to put the claim to the Truth-O-Meter.
The ad features a woman talking to the camera as she shops in a grocery store. It has been airing for several weeks in selected markets on cable channels such as CNN.
""Feeding a family is difficult enough in today's economy,"" the woman says. ""Now, some politicians want the government telling me how I should do it. They want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries I buy, like soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks, even flavored waters, trying to control what we eat and drink with taxes. Give me a break. I can decide what to buy without government help. The government is just getting too involved in our personal lives.""
At that point, a narrator says, ""Government needs to trim its budget fat and leave our grocery budgets alone.""
First, some background on the group airing the ad, Americans Against Food Taxes . The group is spearheaded by the American Beverage Association, which represents the makers of sodas and other drinks. According to Advertising Age ,  the American Beverage Association decided to form the coalition in June 2009, when the idea of taxing sodas and other sweet beverages was being considered as a way to fund the Democratic health care bill. The coalition includes dozens of members, including 7-Eleven, Inc., Burger King Corp., Domino’s Pizza, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, McDonalds, the National Association of Convenience Stores, Snack Food Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc.
Although the food and beverage tax was not included in the health care law, the group has continued to run advertising to forestall any effort to revive such taxes. People watching the ad might think Congress is still considering such a proposal at the federal level. But if you listen closely, the ad played during the Super Bowl is careful to refer to ""politicians"" and ""government"" rather than ""Washington"" or ""Congress."" (By contrast, other ads the group has run have mentioned Washington.)
The ad is correct that politicians in some cash-strapped states are considering food and drink taxes.
In the last two years, many states and cities considered such taxes. According to the Campaign for Healthy Kids , an advocacy group that generally favors such efforts, taxes on soda were enacted in Washington state and proposed -- but not passed -- in Mississippi, New Mexico and the city of Philadelphia.
In New York, Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a New York City Democrat, has proposed a tax on foods high in calories, fat or carbohydrates, for the past several legislative sessions.
Most state lawmakers were sworn in only a few weeks ago, so we can't predict how many states will consider soda-tax proposals this year. But already, legislators have introduced bills to impose or raise the tax on sodas and/or snack foods in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, according to separate legislative tracking by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a pro-business advocacy group, and Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity .
So while Congress has not been active on this proposal since it was dropped from the health care law, it's been proposed in many states.
The ad is correct that ""some politicians … want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries.",1,Americans Against Food Taxes
"John McCain opposed bankruptcy protections for families ""who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay."" Trying to portray his opponent as insensitive to the plight of debt-laden Americans, Sen. Barack Obama used a June 11, 2008, speech to highlight Sen. John McCain's support for a 2005 law that made it more difficult for personal bankruptcy filers to escape debts that they could repay. Specifically, he noted McCain's opposition to an effort to exempt from the law individuals whose medical expenses pushed them into bankruptcy.
""John McCain has been part of the problem,"" Obama said. ""When he had the chance to help families avoid falling into debt, John McCain sided with the credit card companies. When he had the chance to protect teenagers and college students from deceptive credit card practices, he sided with the credit card companies. And when I fought against the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt, he supported it — and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay.""
The attack line revives many Democratic criticisms of the 2005 measure, which created a means test designed to force more consumers to file under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, instead of Chapter 7. Under Chapter 7, individuals could have much of their debt erased, while Chapter 13 requires debtors to enter into court-ordered plans to repay their debts over several years.
The legislation was a huge priority of the financial service industry, which mounted an eight-year lobbying effort to get it enacted. But Democrats, then in the minority of the House and Senate, branded it a ""sweetheart deal"" for credit card companies and argued it would force qualified bankruptcy filers to pay higher attorneys' fees and face more paperwork.
As the bill approached a final vote in the Senate at the end of February 2005, Democrats led by Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois threw up a series of roadblocks in the form of amendments designed to exempt certain groups from the means test, including long-term caregivers and victims of identity theft. Each was shot down by the Republican majority, which was eager to send a ""clean"" bill to the House, where GOP leaders had made it clear they would not vote on legislation laden with amendments.
One amendment offered by Kennedy would exempt debtors if their financial problems were caused by medical expenses. All 54 Republicans in the chamber, including McCain, voted against the measure, which was rejected 39-58. Obama joined 37 other Democrats and Vermont Independent James M. Jeffords in voting for it.
In fairness, McCain did not play a prominent role in this debate. And the vote on Kennedy's amendment was not an especially dramatic moment in the life of the bankruptcy law; there was more attention focused on high-profile votes on amendments to raise the minimum wage and to prevent violent protesters from escaping court-ordered fines or judgments by filing for bankruptcy protection.
Still, a vote is a vote, and in a year where candidates are trying to show empathy for economically stressed Americans, votes like this are likely to carry strong symbolism. Because Obama correctly cites McCain's vote on an effort to narrow the bankruptcy law's reach, we judge his statement True.",1,Barack Obama
"""Today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day Senator McCain took office."" Trying to get the upper hand on lowering gas prices for voters, Barack Obama painted John McCain as doing little to lower the appetite for imports since he joined Congress. Noting he had been there 26 years, Obama suggested his Republican rival resisted solutions.
""Today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day Senator McCain took office,"" Obama told the Democratic National Convention in his featured speech Aug. 28, 2008, in Denver.
First, Obama refers to a 26-year period that began after McCain won a U.S. House seat in 1982, taking office in 1983. (McCain joined the Senate in 1987.)
Using that 1983 starting point, imports tripled by several measures, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Between 1983 and 2007, imports of crude oil — refined to produce products like gasoline — went from 3.3-million barrels a day to 10-million, the EIA reports.
During the same time, net imports of all petroleum went from 4.3-million barrels a day to 12-million, the EIA reports. That's a bit below tripling, but pretty close.",1,Barack Obama
"""The federal government is now on track"" for the second-largest budget deficit ""in 65 years."" Vice President Joe Biden talks a lot about the success of the government's economic policies, but not everybody is persuaded. Reacting to Biden's Aug. 24, 2010, statement that ""we are turning this great ship of state around,"" TV host Glenn Beck pointed to the country's dire fiscal situation.
""Remember, Joe Biden says no doubt we're headed in the right direction on the economy. Well, we're just getting started with the news of the day. How about this one? Unemployment 9.6 percent. The real unemployment number is 16.5 for July. The federal government is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years, 9.1 of GDP. And in 31 months, Congress has added $4.4 trillion to the 10-year spending baseline. Who's going to lend us more money?"" Beck said on his Aug. 25, 2010, show.
In this item, we'll focus on the claim that the federal government ""is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years.""
We turned to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that in 2010, the federal deficit will exceed $1.3 trillion. As a percentage of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the value of the goods and services that the economy produces -- that's 9.1 percent, as Beck said. How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget. Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent, according to the OMB. But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946, so that would put 2010 on track to be the second-highest, according to CBO's figures.
The CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit, with the CBO's being the more recent. The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies' projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 10.6 percent of GDP. That would make it the biggest in 65 years -- not the second biggest. But looking back 65 years and using the CBO's estimate, as Beck did, the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009, when it stood at 9.9 percent.
We thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade. We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations.
Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us via e-mail that the main drivers of today's deficit are the ongoing economic downturn, which has reduced government revenues, and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis. ""Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending, even if Congress does nothing. At the same time, we have enacted $1 trillion in stimulus spending, plus TARP, Fannie/Freddie bailouts, and large discretionary spending hikes. So enacted policies are certainly a contributor,"" Riedl wrote.
The CBO provided a similar explanation. ""This year’s deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it.""
Speaking about future projections, Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to ""runaway government spending.""
Kathy Ruffing, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office, the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed $1 trillion. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over $500 billion of that, she wrote on June 28, 2010. Riedl, however, disagrees. ""Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism, but the data contradict these myths. In reality, spending is almost exclusively the problem,"" he wrote in a June 2010 report.
Finally, Chris Dreibelbis, the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the ""main culprits"" in the current deficit. ""Going forward, the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs, to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers,"" he wrote us in an e-mail.
So let's review. Beck said that we're on track to have the second-biggest budget deficit in 65 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, he's right. Going by the administration's own estimate, the situation is even more dire.",1,Glenn Beck
"""We're now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world. We've surpassed Saudi Arabia."" Considering the United States’ strength in energy production, the debate over building the Keystone XL pipeline has become a symbolic one, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.
On NBC’s Meet the Press on Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress’ first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas.
Klobuchar responded by saying the project ""has merit"" but that the decision to build the pipeline should rest with President Barack Obama, not Congress. She said the debate has become a ""symbolic"" one that ignores America’s healthy energy market.
""We're now the no. 1 producer of oil in the world,"" she said. ""We've surpassed Saudi Arabia.""
We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil producer. As it turns out, the United States passed over Saudi Arabia about two years ago.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, the United States has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia since the fourth quarter of 2012. American oil production surpassed Russia in 2011.
Here’s a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration:
In the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production.
This production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years.
The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices.
Total oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products.
On top of oil , the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.
The majority of the United States’ oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production.
In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing , or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production.
There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market.
""In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,"" Maugeri said.",1,Amy Klobuchar
"""House  Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of  earmarks."" No sooner had Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations  panel, announced a plan to ban earmarks to for-profit companies than Sen. Jim  DeMint, R-S.C., sent out a blast of one-upmanship via Twitter .
""House  Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of  earmarks,"" DeMint wrote. ""That's a fig leaf, not real reform.""
While  Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last  several years, the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the  massive budget deficit and several high-profile ethics investigations. On Feb.  26, the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending  panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists  donated to their campaigns. Although they were cleared, the ethics committee  said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that  political donations have an impact on a legislator's decision to author an  earmark for that company.
It was just that kind of conflict that Rep.  Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10, 2010, he initiated a ban  on budget earmarks to private, for-profit companies.
The move -- one of  several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House -- was hailed by several  government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark  reform.
""For-profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay-to-play,""  said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.
But what  about DeMint's Twitter claim that Obey's ""partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to  90% of earmarks.""
By Obey's calculation (or more accurately, the research  of his House Appropriation Committee staff) the ban on earmarks to for-profit  companies would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks this year, which came to a  total of about $1.7 billion.
Taxpayers for Common Sense, which looked not  only at the roughly 9,000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored  through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to  be earmarks, put the total number of earmarks at 9,499, totaling $15.9  billion.
That puts the number of earmarks not going to for-profits  awfully close to DeMint's 90 percent. Democrats don't really take issue with  that statistic. It's what citing that figure implies, as well as the follow-up  comment that Obey's ban of earmarks to for-profits is ""a fig leaf, not real  reform.""
''The political reality right now is that the public has lost  some confidence in this institution, and one of the reasons is the past abuses  of the earmark process,'' Obey told the New York Times. Earmarks for  profit-making companies are ''the most vulnerable place'' for abuse in the  system, he said.
""It's a step forward,"" Ellis said. ""It's not the answer,  the be-all-end-all. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. It's  real. We've been making progress on earmarks for several years now. And I'm fine  with that. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the  good.""
The day after Obey announced the changes, House Republicans went  one step further, saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest  of the year.
In the Senate, however, banning any earmarks has much less traction.
Senate  Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, Obey's Senate counterpart  and a staunch defender of earmarks, called Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits  ""quizzical.""
""Many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby  for themselves or employ lobbyists,"" Inouye told AP. ""That is how most of them  make the Congress aware of their products and services. It is no secret that  many of these individuals make political contributions. All lobbyists file  disclosure reports. These contributions are all fully disclosed and available  for all to see on the Internet.""
Inouye told the New York Times that the  partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch,  that current earmark restrictions were already working and that ''it does not  make sense to discriminate against for-profit organizations'' by banning  earmarks to them.
A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers  would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin  to reconcile spending bills later this year.
But DeMint, a self-described  ""recovering earmarker,"" would like to nip this issue in the bud now. DeMint  vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year --  along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and 15 Republican co-sponsors -- that  would put a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. In the run-up to the 2008  presidential election, DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal. The bill  was co-sponsored by then-presidential front-runners John McCain as well as  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but it failed by a vote of 71-29.
""The  Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a  stop to this wasteful spending,"" DeMint said. ""Our nation is drowning in debt  that will be paid by our children and we’ll never stop Washington’s spending  addiction unless members of both parties take bold action. We need to focus on  balancing the budget, not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges  to nowhere, teapot museums and monuments to politicians.""
Obey told the  New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress ''a rubber stamp''  of the executive branch.
''Where I come from, the Congress has a perfect  right, in fact an obligation, to participate in the budget process, but we've  got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system,'' he  said. ''This strikes a reasonable balance.''
Ellis, of Taxpayers for  Common Sense, said a one-year moratorium is great, ""but to what end?"" A  moratorium puts off the issue for a year, he said, but Congress still needs a  long-term fix to its spending protocol. Some of the projects financed by  earmarks are worthy of federal dollars, Ellis said. The problem, he said, is  that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than  project merit.
We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls  Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits a ""fig leaf."" As the recent ethics report  found, private companies certainly believe their contributions win them  earmarks. And it's naive to think they don't. So at the very least, Obey's plan  addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact  we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave  90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would. There are differences of opinion on  both sides of the aisle about whether that's necessarily a bad thing. But  DeMint's math is accurate.",1,Jim DeMint
"""The black unemployment rate (has) increased since the recovery has begun."" During a discussion of high unemployment on the July 17, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, turned the spotlight on unemployment among African Americans.
""We have a jobs crisis in America,"" said Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, ""and I think that the debt-ceiling discussion should be decoupled from the deficit discussion, and the nation needs a jobs plan. We have 14 million people out of work. The black unemployment rate is at stifling levels. It's, in fact, increased since the recovery has begun. ""
We decided to check whether the black unemployment rate has gotten worse since the recovery began.
We looked at federal Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers starting in June 2009 -- the month the National Bureau of Economic Research determined was the end of the last recession and the start of the recovery.
In June 2009, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 14.9 percent. In the most recent month, June 2011, the rate was 16.2. So the black unemployment rate definitely did rise over that period.
If you look closer at the numbers, they have actually zig-zagged a bit. The rate peaked at 16.5 percent in March and April 2010, before falling as low as 15.3 percent in February 2011. Since then, the rate has climbed almost a full percentage point over four months.
Still, in the period Morial specified, the black unemployment rate increased by more than a full percentage point.
We should note that Morial has some justification for focusing on black unemployment rates.
Of the four major ethnic groups tracked by BLS -- whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans -- only blacks saw unemployment rise over the period Morial cited.
White unemployment dropped from 8.7 percent to 8.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2011. Hispanic unemployment dropped from 12.2 percent to 11.6 percent. And Asian unemployment dropped from 8.2 percent to 6.8 percent. All told, the overall unemployment rate fell from 9.5 percent to 9.2 percent.
In fact, some segments of the black labor force showed even higher rates of unemployment. For instance, the most recent unemployment rate for blacks between the ages of 16 and 24 years was 31.4 percent.
We find nothing amiss in Morial’s claim that ""the black unemployment rate (has) increased since the recovery has begun.",1,Marc Morial
"""Dodd brought both parties together to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act."" In a new TV ad, two barbers (actually Chicago actors) who like Chris Dodd give him credit for winning bipartisan support to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act.
We find the claim is accurate.
Dodd first introduced the bill in 1985 and it became law in 1993, more than seven years later. It allows workers to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or the illness of a close family member.
It's fair for Dodd to say that he had to work hard to get the bill passed. It was stymied by a Republican filibuster in the Senate in 1988. It fared better in 1990, passing both chambers, but the first President Bush vetoed it. The veto was sustained, and the issue was off the table for the session.
Later, in 1991, Dodd found a critical ally in Republican Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri. They negotiated changes that would make the legislation more palatable to the business community and bring on more Republicans.
The bill cleared in 1992, only to be vetoed again by Bush. Again, the veto was not overridden. Finally, in 1993 the legislation cleared for the third time and President Clinton signed it into law.
It took compromise to allay the fears of the business community and get enough Republicans to support it. When it passed, the States News Service quoted Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. saying ""Dodd has been a bulldog on this.""",1,Chris Dodd
"""The average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks."" In a recent column , Paul Krugman of the New York Times tried to put into context how bad the current job market is.
""The latest economic data have dashed any hope of a quick end to America’s job drought, which has already gone on so long that the average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks,"" he wrote.
We wondered if he was right. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that is the official source of employment statistics.
BLS publishes statistics for ""average weeks unemployed"" for unemployed workers. For the most recent month available, May 2011, the figure was 39.7 weeks -- just as Krugman had said.
We should note that BLS also publishes a second statistic that measures a similar concept -- ""median weeks unemployed."" The terms ""median"" and ""average"" refer to different ways of determining what is a typical case.
Statisticians arrive at a ""median"" by listing all of the numbers by size and then locating the one at the exact midpoint of the list. Half of all examples on the list will be bigger than the median, and half will be smaller. By contrast, an average is determined by adding up all of the numbers on that list and dividing by the total number of items on the list.
As it turns out, the ""median weeks unemployed"" statistic produces a number that’s quite different. The median unemployed worker was out of work for 22 weeks in May 2011 -- a little more than half of the average length of unemployment. This result likely happened because there were a modest number of people with very, very long unemployment spells, as well as a much larger number who had relatively short periods of unemployment. The small number with very long unemployment spells ended up boosting the average duration without moving the median very much.
But does this difference matter in analyzing the accuracy of Krugman’s statement? Not much.
For starters, Krugman’s underlying point -- that long-term unemployment is a serious problem right now -- remains true regardless of which measure you use. The ""average weeks unemployment"" figure hit a record high in May, while the ""median weeks unemployed"" figure hit its fourth-highest level ever.
In fact, prior to the current recession, the average had only surpassed 20 weeks for several months in the early 1980s. And the median only broke into double digits during two prior recessions. Both of these benchmarks are only half the levels we’re seeing today.
Also, the difference between average and median weeks unemployed has been more or less steady over the years -- pretty close to the same two-to-one ratio we see today. So today’s divergence between the two statistics is nothing unusual by historical standards.
So, Krugman could have used a similar statistic that’s shows a much shorter duration for unemployment. But he was careful in his wording, referring to the ""average unemployed American"" rather than, say, the ""typical unemployed American."" And the two statistics tend to move in tandem, so we don’t think that either one is inherently better for describing the situation. We think he’s on safe ground using the 39.",1,Paul Krugman
"""We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil."" Senator Barack Obama may be well known for his verbal acumen, but it also turns out the Illinois Democrat is pretty good at math.
At a debate in Austin Thursday night, the Democratic frontrunner reiterated a statement he has used numerous times on the campaign trail: ""We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.""
To get that figure requires some simple multiplication: barrels of oil imports per day times the cost of barrel of oil equals how much U.S. spends daily purchasing oil abroad. So we dusted off our multiplication tables and checked Obama's math.
According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported 10,102,000 barrels per day of oil during the week ending Feb. 15. The average world price for a barrel of oil that same week was $89.91. That means energy firms spent $908 million on foreign oil daily in mid-February.
Obama's campaign said they used  $100 for the price of a barrel of oil, a record reached Feb. 19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
That number has since dropped a bit – to $98.86 as of Friday afternoon. Redoing the math, what we spend abroad comes awfully close to the billion-dollar figure Obama quotes. It's 998.2 million.
We'll allow him to round up.",1,Barack Obama
"""He's sued gun manufacturers. He was supportive of Brady. He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans."" The full quote from Mike Huckabee's interview:
""One thing I have to admire about Rudy, and he was I think courageous to go to the NRA, because his past positions -- he's sued gun manufacturers. He was supportive of Brady. He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans, which really is a misnomer, because it's really ridiculous to call a semiautomatic weapon an assault weapon.""
We find Huckabee's claims are accurate.
In 2000, during Giuliani's term as mayor, he announced that New York City was filing a lawsuit against two dozen gun manufacturers. The city alleged practices such as deliberately producing more guns than could be legally bought and ignoring illegal sales by gun distributors.
Giuliani has since distanced himself from the lawsuit, recently saying that it ""has taken several turns and several twists that [he does not] agree with,"" but this does not detract from Huckabee's assertion that Giuliani sued gun makers.
The Brady Bill, which created a waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks, became law in 1993. The Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the sale of some semi-automatic weapons, expired in 2004 after 10 years on the books. In a February, 2007 interview Giuliani was asked about them both and said: ""I was in favor of it because I thought that it was necessary both to get the crime bill passed and also necessary with the 2,000 murders or so that we were looking at,"" annually in New York City at the time.
Currently, Giuliani's stance on gun control is ""that we need to enforce laws that exist, as opposed to passing new laws that infringe on individual rights.""
Huckabee's claims, however, deal with Giuliani's past positions rather than his current ones, and as such are accurate.",1,Mike Huckabee
"""The oddest thing is he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts. He did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare, and he doesn't want to do that for America."" There are several pieces to this, so we'll take them one at a time.
First, Massachusetts: As governor, Mitt Romney oversaw a major rewrite of the state's health care program in 2006 that featured a mandate on individuals. Everyone in the state must enroll in a plan or face tax penalties. It's true that Romney vetoed the teeth behind part of the mandate — a charge to companies that didn't offer coverage to employees — which was later overridden by the state Legislature.
So, Giuliani is correct that Romney enacted a ""mandate"" plan, though Romney has sought to avoid that term. Giuliani also is correct that the program in Massachusetts shares some things with the health care proposal put forward by Sen. Hillary Clinton.
Both expand upon the current private-public system. Neither forces changes for those who like their current employer-provided insurance. Both aim to provide coverage for all, with subsidized private plans. And both mandate coverage by penalizing those who can afford to buy a plan but don't.
Now, does that mean the Massachusetts program is ""HillaryCare""? We'll take a pass on judging that one.
Giuliani's other point is that Romney isn't proposing a national plan similar to what he did in Massachusetts. That's true, too. Romney has argued that population demographics vary so much by state that a universal plan can't be applied across the country.
Instead, he has proposed changing the way federal dollars are made available to states — which is what Massachusetts was able to do — so states are free to draw up plans that suit themselves.
Add it all up and Giuliani's got it right.",1,Rudy Giuliani
"Romney refused to pardon ""a decorated soldier"" returning from Iraq who had been charged with a crime involving a BB gun when he was 13. In response to a TV ad by Mitt Romney that highlights Mike Huckabee's 1,000-plus pardons, Huckabee tried to turn the tables and said Romney's refusal to grant pardons denied people who committed small crimes a chance to clear their records.
Huckabee cited one case involving ""a decorated soldier"" who wanted to become a police officer but still had a criminal record from a minor incident when he was 13 years old and shot another boy with a BB gun. ""Didn't even break the skin,"" Huckabee said on NBC's Today Show on Dec. 19.
Huckabee is accurately describing the case of a soldier named Anthony Circosta of Agawam, Mass., a member of the Army National Guard who fought in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star. He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications.
""Now, I would have given that kid a pardon,"" Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. ""And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me.""
Romney refused all pardon requests in his four years as governor. ""I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury,"" he said during a June 2007 debate.
When he was asked about his policy in December 2007, Romney replied ""We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity.""
He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.",1,Mike Huckabee
"""While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart."" At a Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton argued about Obama's recent comments about Ronald Reagan (We addressed the Reagan spat with this item ). As the debate grew heated, Obama portrayed himself as a fighter for Democratic principles and suggested that he was more in touch with working people than she was.
""While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart,"" Obama said.
Obama is referring to the period from 1985 to 1988 when he was a community organizer in neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. And he is correct that during that period, many employers in that area — particularly in the steel industry — were closing their plants and moving jobs overseas. U.S. Steel, for example, employed 40,000 people there in the 1970s but shut down operations in the mid 1980s.
Obama is correct about Clinton's tenure on the Wal-Mart board of directors. She was appointed to the  board in 1986 when her husband was the governor of Arkansas and she served until 1992. As a board member, Clinton pushed for more women in management and a better environmental program, according to a New York Times examination of her work on the board.
At the time, she worked as an attorney for the Rose Law Firm, which had many corporate clients such as Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods. Clinton specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property cases.",1,Barack Obama
"""NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!"" Have you ever dreamed of getting paid just for being a couch potato all day?
A misleading blog post is claiming, ""NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!""
Is that offer too good to be true?
For the most part, it is.
This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post, which is on the website World Facts FTW, claims that NASA wants volunteers to participate in ""bed rest studies,"" as it wants to ""study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.""
As a reward for making it through 60 days of staying in bed and enduring bone, muscle and heart tests, volunteers get a large amount of cash, the post claims.
We wanted to know if this stellar offer was truly up for grabs. We found out that NASA has paid people to stay in bed for long periods of time before. But there’s a pretty large error with the blog post’s headline.
We began by reverse-image searching many of the photos on the website, which were not credited, using RevEye . (RevEye is a image search engine that allows you to search the internet for all the webpages an image appears on.)
Some images were lifted from a Vice article titled ""How I Felt After 70 Days of Lying in Bed for Science."" In that article, a volunteer named Andrew Iwanicki reflects on his experience lying down at a negative 6-degree angle for 10 weeks, and mentions that he was paid $18,000 by NASA.
A number of other news sources corroborate Iwanicki’s story, and a page on NASA’s website tells readers about how bed rest studies help scientists ""understand the effects of living in space.""
But those news outlets reported that NASA paid volunteers $18,000 to participate in a bed study — a far cry from the $100,000 mentioned in the blog post. We found no evidence to support the claim that NASA paid, or will pay, its volunteers $100,000.
The blog post’s headline is also misleading, since it doesn’t consider how difficult it is to participate in a bed rest study, given the high number of applicants and low number of participants required.
In the Vice article, Iwanicki reports that he was one of 55 participants selected out of 25,000 applicants. Given that NASA’s bed studies occur infrequently —the previous one concluded in November 2017 and the next one will start in fall 2018—it seems likely that they would need a small number of volunteers.
A Lexis search did not return any results of NASA paying people $100,000 to participate in a bed rest study, and NASA could not be reached for comment.
We attempted to contact World Facts FTW, the website the blog post was on, by using this contact form , but received an error message after we clicked ""send."" We also could not find a Twitter or Facebook page through which to contact World Facts FTW.
This isn’t the first time that NASA’s bed rest studies have inspired misinformation. We previously debunked a version of the tale that claimed NASA was paying volunteers to lay in bed and smoke weed.",0,Bloggers
"""Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network."" Did Fox News accidentally put up a graphic showing it’s the least trusted network? That’s what bloggers claimed in a post that leaves out important context and details about the graphic.
""Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network,"" said boinboing.net in an April 9 post .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
Bloggers focused on a Fox News segment in which Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz, talks with Republican strategist and pollster Frank Luntz about President Donald Trump, the media and public trust.
""When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News,"" Boingboing.net’s post said . ""Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.""
Boingboing.net said Kurtz asked then quickly asked for the graphic to be taken down. Kurtz did request that the graphic be taken down — but the graphic did not indicate Fox News was the least trusted network.
In fact, the graphic, based on a Monmouth University poll , asked ""Who do you trust more?"" But individuals polled were asked who they trusted more as a source of information (CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, Fox News or Trump), or both equally.
The Fox News graphic showed that 48 percent of people said they trusted CNN more, compared to 35 percent who trusted Trump more; 45 percent said they trusted MSNBC more, compared to 32 percent who trusted Trump more; 30 percent trusted Fox News more, compared to 20 percent who trusted Trump more.
The question was not about the most trustworthy network and was not a direct comparison of CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.
The Washington Post on April 9 reported that Fox News pushed back on reports that its network was the least trusted among competitors. It said the Associated Press published a story headlined ""Fox News mistakenly posts graphic showing it lags in trust."" (AP’s new headline says ""Fox News host: Graphic posted at wrong point of show."")
The newspaper also noted that CNN’s Chris Cuomo tweeted a RawStory.com post headlined, ""Watch Fox host Howard Kurtz panic after graphic shows Fox News is least trusted network.""
RawStory.com added an updated to its story saying it included a response from Kurtz and that the headline had been revised for accuracy. It's new headline reads, "" ‘Take that down’: Howard Kurtz surprised after graphic pops up showing Fox News is least trusted network.""
Boingboing.net also added an update at the top of its post on April 12.
The amended post said:""UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump .""
Kurtz did elaborate on the graphic after his show — not because it was confusing, but because he said the Associated Press ran a story ""that utterly distorts what happened.""
""The AP reported my request to take down the graphic and ended the story there, creating a false impression by not mentioning that I called for the very same graphic shortly afterward,"" Kurtz wrote in an April 9 Facebook post . ""This echoed partisan chatter online that I had somehow panicked or didn’t want to show the poll graphic, which is flatly contradicted by reality.""
Kurtz wrote that the graphic was mistakenly posted early, while he was discussing fake news, but brought back later in the show. ( AP ran a correction about that point.)",0,Bloggers
"Poor people go to a ""payday lender...and they pay 300, 400, 500 percent interest."" At a campaign stop in Americus, Georgia, John Edwards said the U.S. has ""the worst saving rate in the industrialized world.""  As a consequence, when the bills come in many working Americans can be short of money.  ""And so the result is, they go to the payday lender, right? And they pay 300, 400, 500 percent interest.""
He is right about those interest rates, and some experts think he understates the problem. Over the years, a number of groups have looked at the practices of such lenders and found that the rates they charge are enormously high.
Jean Ann Fox, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, an expert on the subject who has testified in Congress, says ""the bottom line is he is being conservative in his description of how expensive these loans are.""
A November 2006 study by Fox's organization, the CFA, ""Cashed Out:  Consumers Pay Steep Premium  to 'Bank' at Check Cashing Outlets,"" concluded that ""check cashers make two-week term payday loans based on personal checks held for future deposit at effective annual interest rates between 390 percent -780 percent.""  The average cost of a $300 loan was 406 percent annual percentage rate, according to this survey.
The Center for Responsible Lending, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy group that focuses on fighting abusive lending practices, has a list of the signs of predatory payday lending.  The number one sign is lenders who typically charge an interest rate of 400 percent APR or higher.
Payday loans allow an individual to use a post-dated personal check to get a small, short-term cash advanThe Congressional Research Service also looked into this lending system and explained how they work: Typically, an individual writes a post-dated personal check to the lender, typically for $100-$500.  The lender holds onto the check until the borrower's next paycheck.  The fee on a two-week loan (the usual amount of time between pay periods) is between $15- $17 per $100. That may seem like a small amount, but it is equal to an annual percentage rate of between 391 percent and 443 percent, according to CRS.
The Center for Responsible Lending produced yet another study, this one in November 2006, ""Financial Quicksand:  Payday Lending Sinks Borrowers in Debt with $4.2 billion in Predatory Fees Every Year.""  The report found that nationwide ""borrowers were paying more in interest, at annual rates of 400 percent, than the amount of the loan they originally borrowed.""
A 2004 report from the Consumer Federation of America, ""Unsafe and Unsound:  Payday Lenders Hide Behind FDIC Bank Charters to Peddle Usury,"" put the average loan rates close to 500 percent.
""Edwards is right on the money,"" says Ellen Schloemer, research director at the Center for Responsible Lending.  ""The rates are outrageous.""",1,John Edwards
"""The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children."" The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail list of ""10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)."" The e-mail goes after him on issues from domestic policy to foreign policy to personal attributes. It urges recipients to forward the email to ""your friends, family and co-workers.""
Item five addresses children's issues. ""The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.""
It's true that McCain had the worst score — 10 percent — in the Senate from the Children's Defense Fund for 2007. But it's important to note that McCain's score was so low because he missed eight of 10 votes that the fund evaluates. On the two issues remaining, McCain voted for one (raising the minimum wage) and against one (expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP).
For the record, Sen. Barack Obama scored 60 percent, missing four of the critical 10 votes and siding with the group on the six votes he cast. Sen. Hillary Clinton scored 70 percent, missing three votes and agreeing with the group on the seven votes she cast.
MoveOn is correct that McCain voted against the children's health bill and defended President Bush's veto of the program. McCain, though, said he voted against the bill because it didn't contain adequate provisions for paying for the expansion.
""The American people have rebelled against out-of-control spending. If they can find a legitimate way to pay for it, I would consider it,"" he said.
So McCain may have scored better on the Children's Defense Fund scorecard if he had been there for more of the votes. (Though McCain's history with the group isn't that great, either. In 2006, his score was 10 percent and in 2005 it was 22 percent.) But MoveOn omits the caveat that his vote against SCHIP was based on spending concerns.
But these are minor points, and not enough to notch down the Truth-O-Meter too much.",1,MoveOn.org
"""You can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes."" One of the more unusual claims to come up at the recent economic summit in Orlando was this one from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: ""You can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes.""
Now, we knew that 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis supposedly read books on Swedish land use planning for fun, but does Bush really spend his time studying up on tax administration policies in Estonia, a Baltic nation with roughly 1.3 million people?
More importantly -- five minutes? Really?
With tax compliance in the United States estimated to cost upwards of $107 billion in 2005, we knew we had to take a closer look.
We started by asking aides to Bush -- who is preparing to officially announce his candidacy on June 15 -- for supporting evidence. They sent us links to two articles. In 2012, the website Business Insider called Estonia’s tax system ""scarily efficient,"" noting that ""the process takes an average of five minutes."" The following year, The Economist agreed, reporting that ""filing an annual tax return online, as 95% of Estonians do , takes about five minutes.""
We decided to go a step further and check with actual Estonians. So we contacted four journalists in Estonia who have not only written about economic policy but have filed taxes there themselves.
Here’s the kicker: It turns out Bush was over-estimating how long the Estonian system takes.
• ""Yes, it is possible to file a tax return in Estonia online in five minutes. And probably even in three to four minutes,"" said Tarmo Vahter, deputy editor of the weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress .
• ""If you have only one, or maybe two or three, income sources, like a salary from your main job … five minutes may be even too long,"" said Argo Ideon, the political and business editor at the daily newspaper Postimees AS . ""I have probably used just two minutes several times.""
• ""It took me no more than five minutes,"" said Sirje Rank, the foreign editor at the business newspaper Äripäev . ""Just push the send button. Done.""
• ""Of course, it depends on the person and on the variety of incomes and the complications, but in general, the tax form may be filled even in one minute,"" said Kaja Koovit, the head of the business desk at the daily newspaper Eesti Päevaleht . ""I can confirm it based on my own experiences.""
Okay, okay, so it’s an awesome system. But what makes it so good?
It’s because Estonian taxpayers are presented with a tax form that is pre-filled with their data. All they have to do is add in any additional factors, make sure it’s correct, and press ""send.""
""We have a simple tax system, a very high level of accessibility to the Internet, easy and secure electronic authentication, highly developed information-technology programs and certain tax laws that help us to gather the data from third parties in order to use it for pre-filling tax returns,"" said Mailis Peek da Costa Figueira of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board , Estonia’s equivalent of the IRS.
Those third parties that submit financial information electronically to the tax and customs board include employers, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations, said Hannes Udde, another specialist with the board.
""Forty percent of taxpayers submitted their return with one click, and it took less than one minute,"" Udde said. If there is additional data required, such as income from abroad, self-employment income or property sales, ""it may take more than five minutes, but it is still very easy and convenient,"" Udde said.
Once the taxpayer verifies and submits the data, the tax agency double-checks the declared information. If no problems come up, refunds are typically issued within five days. If a possible error emerges, the agency emails the taxpayer for additional information to reconcile the situation, Udde said.
Sounds wonderful -- maybe it’s something the United States could benefit from?
Well, as it turns out, President Barack Obama proposed something much like this during his 2008 campaign. Obama said he would direct the IRS to ""give taxpayers the option of a pre-filled tax form to verify, sign and return to the IRS or online. This will eliminate the need for Americans to hire expensive tax preparers and to gather information that the federal government already has on file.""
But a funny thing happened on the way to enactment: Crickets. PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken .
Why? According to the Sunlight Foundation , ""companies that prepare taxes are throwing millions at Congress to oppose making tax filing easier."" The foundation writes that the companies ""warn that IRS-prepared returns will cost millions to develop and will result in more filing errors and missed refunds for taxpayers. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform … calls the system ‘ a money-grab by the government ’ and points out the conflict of interest that arises from a tax collector like the IRS preparing taxpayers' returns.""

"Say Maxine Waters told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to ""impeach Donald Trump."" Maxine Waters may be just one of 435 members of Congress, but President Donald Trump has elevated the profile of the California Democrat.
In March, at a campaign rally in southwestern Pennsylvania, Trump called Waters — a fierce opponent and the president’s ideological opposite — ""a very low-I.Q. individual.""
""You ever see her?"" Trump continued, to boos aimed at Waters. ""You ever seen her? You ever see her? 'We will impeach him! We will impeach the president!' But he hasn't done anything wrong. ‘It doesn't matter, we will impeach him!’ She's a low I.Q. individual. You can't help it. She really is.""
Given Waters’ role as a foil for Trump, she has become fodder for social media posts by Trump’s allies.
One we came across was the following post that appeared on May 15, 2018, on the Facebook page ""Judge Jeanine Pirro has Fans."" This Facebook group bills itself as an independent fan page for Pirro, a Fox News host who is closely allied with Trump.
According to the Facebook group’s ""about"" page, ""Judge Jeanine Pirro is out spoken and always on target. This site will expound on what the Judge is talking about and report what mainstream media won't."" The group counted 713,110 followers when we first saw the post.
The post shows what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN appearance by Waters with host Anderson Cooper. The chyron at the bottom of the screen said, ""Maxine Waters 2020,"" and the meme offered the following dialogue:
Anderson: ""If elected what would your first act as President be?""
Waters: ""Well Anderson, I would impeach Donald Trump.""
The group shared the image by saying, ""And we pay her a salary!""
The problem: Waters never said anything of the sort.
The image appears to be from a real newscast on April 19, 2017, when Cooper interviewed Waters about Bill O’Reilly’s departure from Fox News.
But the chyron ""Maxine Waters 2020"" is fake. The original chyron said, ""Bill O’Reilly Out at Fox News.""
The meme aims to make it look like Waters actually said that she would impeach Trump if elected president, which would be nonsensical. Obviously, there would be no need to impeach Trump if she either defeated him or succeeded him after he left office. Also, it’s up to Congress to impeach the president.
Waters has called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, but on several occasions — including an interview with the platform Cheddar and a rally at the U.S. Capitol — she called for Trump’s impeachment directly. When she denied on MSNBC in April 2017 that she had called for Trump’s impeachment, we rated her claim Pants on Fire .
We found no evidence that Waters is seriously considering a run for president. While she has occasionally joked about it, she shot down the idea during an appearance on The View in August 2017. (Her office did not respond to an inquiry for this article; nor did the administrator for the Pirro fan site)
Snopes.com noted that the meme appeared elsewhere before the Pirro fan site picked it up. The faked dialogue seems to have initially started as a joke in a May 11 tweet , and a version with the Cooper-Waters visual was retweeted May 14 by Fox News host Brian Kilmeade (he added: ""genius""), earning more than 900 retweets and more than 3,000 likes.",0,Bloggers
"Illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border is ""the lowest in 17 years."" President Donald Trump hasn’t been decisive on whether he’d sign a spending bill that did not include funding for his promised border wall. But he raised a related topic in an interview with the Associated Press: declining illegal immigration.
""People want the border wall … They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower,"" Trump said in the April 21 interview , which we fact-checked .
Trump’s wording did not specify what was the lowest in 17 years, but similar comments made by others in his administration indicate he was referring to apprehensions at the southwest border by border patrol agents. Historical data from Border Patrol show that Trump’s claim is accurate.
Southwest border apprehensions
Trump has used different timeframes to make a case that fewer people are attempting to cross into the United States illegally.
He’s looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016 to say it’s gone down 61 percent ; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 agents made 12,193 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. It is the lowest number in at least 17 years , according to monthly southwest border apprehension numbers since fiscal year 2000.
Apprehension data is generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration.
Experts have told us that Trump’s rhetoric has played a role in deterring illegal immigration, perhaps more so than his newly issued policies, which may take longer to implement on the ground.
""The recent dip in apprehensions likely does signify a trend, in particular as apprehensions typically rise in March and early spring,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that researches migration.
It’s still to be determined if it’s a temporary lull or a lasting decline, ""but at this point it seems clear that would-be migrants are concerned about rising enforcement not just at the border but within the United States,"" Mittelstadt said.
Apprehensions at the southwest border peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) but began a declining trend during the 2008-09 recession that has continued since, Mittelstadt said.
Aside from policies and enforcement in the United States, factors in Mexico have contributed to lower apprehension numbers, Mittelstadt said, among them: lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy.
Trump isn’t the only one who has said the numbers are declining; Democrats have cited the same point.
During the Democratic National Convention we rated Mostly True a claim by U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. that fewer people were crossing the southwest border than in the last three decades. More recently, Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr., of Michigan, also said apprehension rates had plummeted and that numbers for Mexicans caught by Border Patrol had reached their lowest point in nearly half a century. That also rated Mostly True .
Mittelstadt, from Migration Policy Institute, noted that as the number of Mexicans apprehended has gone down recently, about one-third of apprehensions last year were Central American unaccompanied minors and families seeking refuge in the United States – presenting themselves to immigration authorities instead of evading detection.
Apprehensions of Central Americans outnumbered those of Mexicans in 2014 and 2016.
""Amid overall declining unauthorized inflows, the Obama administration prioritized putting more people in formal removal proceedings rather than permitting voluntary return, which increases the range of punishments for those seeking to re-enter illegally,"" Mittelstadt said. ""And during the Obama administration, as occurred with prior administrations, sizable new border enforcement resources were provided by Congress.""",1,Donald Trump
"""At least Obama didn't marry his cousin,"" as Giuliani did. A wildly popular YouTube video featuring a scantily clad ""Obama Girl"" -- with no connection to Barack Obama's campaign -- criticizes Rudy Giuliani for marrying his cousin.
Barelypolitical.com produced the video ""Debate 08: Obama Girl vs. Giuliani Girl,"" a follow up to their successful video ""I got a crush on Obama,"" which featured Amber Lee Ettinger lip-synching a song about the Democratic presidential candidate.
In the debate video, another dancer is introduced and the two argue about the merits of their respective candidates. At one point, Obama Girl raps, ""Giuliani Girl, just stop your fussing, at least Obama didn't marry his cousin.""
We find Obama Girl's claims are accurate.
In 1968, Giuliani wed his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, who was the daughter of his father's first cousin. (Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin's daughter/son.)
Giuliani at different points labeled the family connection as ""second cousins once removed"" and ""third cousins,"" before he was corrected, according to news reports.
In a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the ""weirdness"" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed.
Robin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins. But she said, ""for second cousins, the risks are likely similar to the risks of couples from the same ethnic population who also may have common ancestors.""
Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children, and the marriage ended after 14 years.",1,Obama Girl
"Former business partner Robert Gay says: ""The man who helped save my daughter was Mitt Romney."" A TV ad by Mitt Romney features former business partner Robert Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite Gay with his daughter after she went missing.
On July 6, 1996 the girl sneaked off during the weekend to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy, according to news reports at the time. She had told her parents she was playing tennis.
When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa.
Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort.
According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teenaged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11.
Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police said police reports at the time do not mention Romney, but Peterson and reports at the time show the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl.
""The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on channel 7 and called in,"" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station.
Gay says Romney helped ""save"" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. ""Doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day,"" according to the Boston Globe in 2002.
Newsday reported in July 1996 that ""Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ...""
""She was not harmed,"" Robert Gay said at new conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News . ""She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home.""
The ad says Romney ""helped save"" the girl, and we certainly aren't going to argue over the physical condition of the girl when she was found. Her Dad says she was ""saved,"" and under the circumstances we won't disagree. The ad also says Romney ""helped."" Hard to argue with that either. True.",1,Mitt Romney
"""By funding the authorization that’s already happened a decade ago (in the Secure Fence Act of 2006), we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to secure the border."" With Donald Trump days away from taking the presidential oath, Republicans have been examining ways to help him meet his campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Critics have called out the proposed wall as a tremendous expense. But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., has said the Secure Fence Act of 2006 already supports construction of the border wall.
""By funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Messer said in a CNN story published Jan. 6.
We wondered if the 2006 law gives Trump the green light to get started on his immigration promise. Experts told us Messer’s claim is on point.
A 2006 law
The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush .
The act allowed the Department of Homeland Security to ""take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.""
Those actions include the use of personnel, technology and physical infrastructure enhancements, the law says.
That authorization of physical infrastructure enhancements could include a fence, wall, barrier, et cetera, said Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for Messer.
The 2006 law defined "" operational control "" as the prevention of all unlawful entries into the country, ""including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""
It also directed the department to build two-layered fencing along five stretches of the border, amounting to about 850 miles, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report . That double layer requirement was revised by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 , the report said.
The modification directed the Homeland Security secretary to construct reinforced fencing "" along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border.""
Currently, there are 702 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That includes 652 miles of primary fencing, 36 miles of double-layered fencing and 14 miles of tertiary fencing, according to the agency.
In a post-election interview Nov. 13, Trump told CBS's Lesley Stahl he would accept fencing ""for certain areas … but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate."" In a press conference Jan. 11, Trump told reporters, ""It’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall.""
The Secure Fence Act of 2006 gives the Department of Homeland Security some discretion on how they choose to secure the border and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 gave the department greater flexibility, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank researching global issues.
""It is our belief that U.S. Customs and Border Protection can build additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border — whether you call these ‘walls,’ fences or other sorts of barriers — in the regular course of its work and without requiring additional authorization from Congress,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications and public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank studying migration policies and trends.
A limitation for the construction of the southwest border wall would rise from Congress’ willingness to pay for it, not from needed authorization, said Edward Alden, an expert on border security and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank.
The REAL ID Act of 2005 , passed by Congress, even gave the Homeland Security secretary the authority to "" waive all legal requirements "" that may get in the way of constructing border barriers, Alden noted.
That authority was used in 2008 by then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to waive environmental reviews .",1,Luke Messer
"Democrats ""setup"" and ""manipulated"" the political violence in Charlottesville California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R-Orange County, repeated a debunked conspiracy theory this week that top Democrats ""setup"" and ""manipulated"" the political violence at last month’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va.
In August, PolitiFact national took a deep look at this inflammatory claim, which started with controversial commentator Alex Jones of Infowars.com. Jones said emails show Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and billionaire investor George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to ""control"" and keep people ""desperate."" After an exhaustive examination of relevant leaked emails, it found no evidence of Jones’ theory and rated it Pants On Fire, the most severe false rating.
See the full fact check here .
The violence in Charlottesville culminated with the death of Heather D. Heyer, 32. She was killed and at least 19 others were injured after the driver of a Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally. Authorities charged a 20-year-old man from Ohio, James A. Fields Jr. , with second-degree murder. Fields had marched in the white nationalist rally.
Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman and former speechwriter for President Reagan, has garnered controversy in recent months for his pro-Russia stance amid intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election.
Democrats have targeted his congressional seat in 2018.
Rohrabacher’s claim
Below are Rohrabacher’s conspiracy theory comments made in a San Francisco Chronicle article on Sept. 14, 2017.
The article says Rohrabacher is ""deep"" into the theory that ""Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va.""
Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former ""Hillary and Bernie supporter"" got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.
""It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,"" Rohrabacher said. ""It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation"" and to ""put our president on the spot.""
PolitiFact California asked Rohrabacher’s spokesman Ken Grubbs for any evidence supporting the claim. Grubbs told us the congressman saw a FoxNews.com article in which Jason Kessler, the organizer of the ""Unite the Right"" white nationalist rally says ""he voted for Obama and was involved in Occupy Wall Street.""
The article says Kessler voted for Obama in 2008 and ""once attended an Occupy Wall Street rally in Charlottesville.""
It offers no evidence -- nor does it even discuss the idea -- that Democrats ""setup"" a group of ""Civil War re-enactors"" and manipulated a confrontation, as Rohrabacher claims.
PolitiFact’s conclusion
PolitiFact national found Jones’ comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats.
It found no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out.
PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire .

"Under Hosni Mubarak's rule, ""Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel."" Hosni Mubarak may have ruled Egypt with an iron fist since 1981, but he's been an important ally for the United States in the fight against terrorism -- or so the thinking goes.
New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, though, questioned whether Mubarak has been as helpful as some believe. Mubarak, after all, led a regime that tortured political dissidents.
""By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri — Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda — out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad,"" Douthat wrote . Douthat credited the book The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright, for documenting that history.
""At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview,"" Douthat wrote. ""Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States.""
Douthat concluded his column by noting that a different government in Egypt might not necessarily be a good thing. ""The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door,"" he wrote.
We were interested in Douthat's statement about aid to Egypt.
He is correct based on the most recent statistics. If you don't count Afghanistan ($8.9 billion) and Iraq ($7.5 billion) because of the ongoing U.S. military operations, then Israel ($2.4 billion) is indeed the top recipient, followed by Egypt ($1.5 billion).
That's followed by Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). We found these ratings in the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract , which compiled 2008 military and economic aid.
Foreign aid includes things such as money for economic development, agriculture or children's health. In Egypt's case, most of the money in recent years has gone to military aid, particularly heavy equipment such as tanks, helicopters and fighter planes.
We should note that Egypt will likely slip a place when the official 2010 figures are released, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Haiti is expected to receive more aid, because of the earthquake that occurred there in 2010. The Globe also reported that much of the aid the U.S. sends to Egypt comes back to the United States when Egypt purchases weapons from U.S. defense manufacturers.
Still, Douthat wrote that Egypt has received more money than any country besides Israel ""under his rule."" That would mean the 30 years since Mubarak came to power in late 1981. We turned to the same source the Statistical Abstract used, the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants data as collected in the "" Greenbook ."" The Greenbook, which is compiled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, provides ""a complete historical record of United States' (U.S.) foreign aid to the rest of the world by reporting all loans and grants authorized by the U.S. Government for each fiscal year,"" according to its site.
We obtained aid data by country, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 U.S. dollars, from 1982 to 2009 . This time, Israel ($117.6 billion) was number one, followed by Egypt ($83.7 billion) at number two. Rounding out the top 10 were Iraq ($54.4 billion), Afghanistan ($35.2 billion), Russia ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($18 billion), Turkey ($16.7 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), Sudan ($10.3 billion), and Colombia ($10.3 billion).
For our ruling, we wanted to know if Douthat was correct that under Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. Douthat is right.",1,Ross Douthat

"Says extras are needed to portray aliens in a Star Wars movie being shot near Rosenberg, Texas. This just in from WBN12 : A Star Wars movie seeks Texans to appear as alien extras southwest of Houston.
But don’t decamp just yet. This seeming news post proved as fake as a Wookiee .
PolitiFact Texas looked into this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day , April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life.""
We were suspicious of the Texas-tied call for extras from launch because there’s been no legitimate report out of Hollywood that a Star Wars movie is going to be shot in Texas. It didn’t help that the WBN12.com post is undated or that it’s identical, except for the place name, from a post saying the same about Las Vegas, Nev., that was debunked by Snopes.com --in 2016.
Another sign the claim lacks validity? The WBN12 website includes a disclaimer stating: ""wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes.""
The 'call' for Texas extras
The post, which came to our attention through PoiltiFact’s fake-news-spotting partnership with Facebook, is datelined Rosenberg, which is home to more than 30,000 people on U.S. 59 nearly 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston .
It opens: ""Reports out of Hollywood this morning are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie will be filmed near Rosenberg, Texas. The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe.""
The post continues: ""No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however.""
The post goes on to say local fans (no one identified by name) are excited at the prospect and that producers (no one named) said in a statement: ""We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we’re very excited about filming here.""
No evidence for a Texas casting call
We didn’t reach anyone directly connected to the Disney-owned Star Wars movies.
Otherwise a web search turned up a Dec. 22, 2016, post on the moviecastingcall.org website describing casting calls for a Han Solo anthology film including mention that filming is to take place in 2017 ""at the Pinewood Studios in London, England among other undisclosed locations in the United Kingdom,"" pretty far from Texas.
Under the subhead ""Extras Casting,"" that post says: ""Casting calls and registration for extras will be posted here as they become available.""
We heard back next from the owner of moviecastingcall.org, Alan Baltes, who emailed: ""My website posts accurate information"" about Disney and Marvel casting and auditions. Baltes, noting WBN12’s disclaimer, described its post about casting for Star Wars extras near Rosenberg as one of several that’s surfaced about the next Star Wars film getting shot in Texas. ""The same hoax has been posted over the years, making the same claim, but stating filming would take place in other areas of the United States,"" Baltes wrote.
In Rosenberg, a city spokeswoman, Jenny Pavlovich, said by phone that before our inquiry, she hadn’t heard of local Star Wars shoots. A Fort Bend County official, Beth Wolf, said people around the courthouse had heard the Star Wars rumor though she hadn’t encountered confirmation.

"""In December of 2017, the Prince William board of supervisors had a meeting ...

On Dec. 12, 2017, the Prince William County board of supervisors met to consider , among other things, an increase in spending on the county’s substance-abuse treatment programs.
Stewart was not present at that meeting. He was on the campaign trail in Alabama with Moore, carrying out a plan he announced two days earlier in a news release, according to local reports .
Stewart also detailed his visit to Alabama in a Facebook live video . He said he planned to fly to Atlanta, and drive a rental car to Montgomery in order to show support for Moore, who he said was a fellow ""anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate.""
""If you’re wondering, why am I going down to Alabama, why is it important, and that is because we’re all in this together, folks, we’re all in this together,"" Stewart said. ""It is the establishment Republicans who are together colluding with Democrats, with liberals, and they’re trying to take out every single anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate.""
""I’m going down there to support him,"" Stewart added. ""Next year, when the establishment comes after me … I’m hoping, of course, that I will get his help as well.""
Stewart later tweeted a photo taken at the Moore rally in Alabama. ""With @UofAlabama students at the @MooreSenate rally! #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp,"" he wrote.
Stewart’s support for Roy Moore
Most conservatives severed ties with Moore, but Stewart supported him even as accusations surfaced detailing his sexual misconduct with teenagers. ""I am not going to cut and run from a good man like Judge Roy Moore,"" he said in a Facebook live video .
Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to multiple occasions when Stewart defended Moore or explained his belief that Moore should have been presumed innocent until proven guilty because the accusations were decades-old.
In a post-debate interview with PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff, who moderated the debate, Stewart refused to condemn Moore. ""I do believe (Moore) when he said he didn’t do that,"" Stewart said.
""I thought that he was treated unfairly,"" Stewart added. ""I don’t think it’s right that 40 years after something supposedly happened, somebody comes out and says that you do something, and then, instead of them having to prove that you did it, it was left upon him to try to prove that he didn’t do it.""
Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch acknowledged Stewart’s continued support for Moore in an email. ""Corey never claimed to have disavowed Moore,"" he wrote. ""To claim so would be false.""",1,Tim Kaine
"""Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism."" Hillary Clinton, riding a bump in the polls, kept the heat on Donald Trump during a speech in Cincinnati that marked the first time she had campaigned alongside Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party.
""Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism,"" Clinton said during the speech on June 27, 2016.
We don’t take a position on whether Trump actually is one of the top threats facing the global economy. But we thought we’d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument.
So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes.
When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of The Economist, the London-based newsweekly -- is a research and analysis firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world.
The firm made headlines in March 2016 when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to ""companies’ capacity to operate at target profitability."" The rankings are based on ""qualitative"" judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says.
In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with ""the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy.""
But the Trump threat level increased in the July 2016 rankings . A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12.
In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for ""China experiences a hard landing"" and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for ""currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness.""
Specifically, the firm wrote that ""although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn."" The writeup cited his ""hostility"" to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his ""militaristic tendencies,"" his skepticism toward NATO, and his ""indifference"" to nuclear proliferation in Asia.
The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, an official told Politico .
We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton’s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was.
""Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios,"" Powell told PolitiFact. ""Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy.""
Clinton said ""risk analysts"" -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that ""analysts"" was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.)
But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins.
On June 17, Moody’s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, published its projections of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checked the political background of one of the Moody's authors in another report.)
""Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached,"" the Moody’s team wrote. ""One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"Under President Barack Obama’s leadership, ""since June 2009, (the auto) industry has added a quarter of a million jobs."" One of the big themes of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., has been a celebration of what President Barack Obama did to help the automobile industry when it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse in early 2009.
Bob King -- president of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, better known as the UAW -- emphasized that point in his speech to the convention on Sept. 5, 2012.
""President Obama took action, putting together a rescue team, demanding real change and real sacrifice from everyone involved — from management, from labor, from suppliers, from debt-holders, from dealers, from everybody involved,"" King said. ""It was not universally popular, but it was absolutely right. President Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs, and the auto industry is thriving again. These are good, middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics and steel—jobs making things for an economy built to last.""
With Detroit’s comeback such a big topic at the convention, we thought it was worth checking to see if that was accurate.
We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data.
There are two categories relevant to this analysis. One is ""motor vehicles and parts manufacturing."" Since June 2009, seasonally adjusted employment in this sector has increased by 165,100 jobs.
The second category is ""motor vehicle and parts dealers."" Over the same period, employment in that sector increased by 84,500.
Add these two figures together and you get 249,600 jobs -- almost exactly a quarter million.
With statements such as these, PolitiFact considers not just whether the statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question deserves the credit or blame attributed to it.
In this case, determining Obama’s precise role in aiding the auto industry is more a matter of opinion than fact, but experts have told us for other articles that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans. So we think it’s reasonable to credit Obama’s ""strong leadership"" with a role in producing these numbers.",1,Bob King
"""Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief"" A headline on an online story says, ""Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief.""
The article includes a photo of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, wearing a shirt with ""NASTY"" printed in large block letters. This photo is taken from a television appearance following Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in September 2017.
Cruz was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, accusing him of providing insufficient aid to the island .
On Facebook, the story's link preview shows Cruz’s face above the headline. But she has not been accused of fraud related to hurricane relief.
The article, published July 15 on Your News Wire, reveals that Cruz isn’t facing charges at all. A different Puerto Rican mayor was accused. (Fact-checkers at The Weekly Standard caught that the initial version of the story said that Cruz and her party faced charges, but the language had been changed by the time we looked at it. Some versions of the story copied elsewhere had not made the change.)
We decided to dig a little deeper and see what else might be misleading about this story.
Wrong mayor
The mayor facing fraud charges is Miguel Ortiz-Vélez of Sabana Grande. Federal authorities have accused him of running a three-year scheme, beginning in 2013 and ending in 2016, to defraud the government of $3 million. Ortiz-Vélez proposed projects to the Puerto Rico Department of Education, but intentionally overestimated their cost.
He gave the extra money to the companies he contracted out for the work, as well as to the city. The owner of one of the companies reimbursed Ortiz-Vélez nearly $23,000 in cash.
Ortiz-Vélez was indicted on July 2 for theft of government money, mail fraud, and money laundering. If he is found guilty, he could face up to 30 years in prison.
Close, but no cigar
The article on Your News Wire mixes the alleged Ortiz-Vélez scheme with another case of fraud in Puerto Rico. Two finance directors in Tao Baja were accused of misusing federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services.
The Your News Wire story implies that this money was meant as hurricane relief funds, calling it ""assistance funds"" that were given ""during the same general time frame as the disaster.""
This scheme took place from 2014 until early 2016, long before Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The money was meant to be used for promoting economic development and building new public facilities. Instead, the finance directors put the funds toward paying municipal employees and contractors.
This investigation is ongoing, and, again, separate from the investigation into Ortiz-Vélez.
A lawsuit
There have been allegations against Cruz as well, which some outlets have connected to misuse of federal disaster relief funds . In February 2018, a former government worker sued the municipality of San Juan. She claims that the city was committing fraud by paying some contractors far more than others. She also claims she was demoted for speaking out against the corruption.
A local San Juan paper reported that, according to two unnamed sources, the FBI has opened an investigation into the alleged fraud. However, the plaintiff of the suit resigned in June 2017, before Hurricane Maria. The suit does not include any mention of federal disaster aid.",0,Bloggers
"""Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent."" In response to the Washington Post article about Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore having relationships with teenage girls in the past, some articles surfaced accusing one of the women of having political motivations.
The conservative website Activist Mommy said that Deborah Wesson Gibson, who said Moore solicited dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s, has worked for national Democrats. The website also said that Gibson is supporting Doug Jones, the Democrat running against Moore in the Dec 12 special election. (Gibson told the Post that she was 17 when Moore asked her out on dates that did not progress beyond kissing.)
""Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent,"" states the headline Nov. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The Activist Mommy story states that Gibson ""is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones. .... social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC.""
The website states that Gibson is a sign language interpreter who has interpreted at rallies for former Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.
We found more details in a report from the Alabama Media Group, AL.com , which stated that Gibson owns an interpreting company, Signs of Excellence, and linked to photos posted on its Facebook page showing her interpreting for Clinton as well as Biden.
Fox News showed additional photos on Signs of Excellence’s Facebook page that included Gibson interpreting for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s 2016 Senate bid and appearing with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, both Florida Democrats.
Reached at her Signs of Excellence business phone number in Florida on Nov. 13, Gibson declined to comment.
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told PolitiFact that Gibson and her company never received payment from the DNC.
The Activist Mommy website shows only a little information linking Gibson to Jones, the Democrat running against Moore. But the information doesn’t show Gibson actively campaigning for him.
The site shows Gibson shared a Sept. 20 statement on Facebook by Jones’ campaign announcing that Biden would appear on his behalf.
""I was honored to interpret for Vice President Biden in the fall of 2012!"" she wrote in a comment, including a photo of her alongside Biden.
The website also showed that she shared a story by New York Magazine stating that Democrats have a chance to beat Moore.
Gibson, a Delray Beach, Fla., resident, is a long-time registered Republican voter in Palm Beach County. She initially registered without any party affiliation in April 1995 and then switched her registration to Republican in December 1995, according to Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. She has since remained registered as a Republican.
Gibson voted in the presidential preference primary in March 2016 and in the general election in November 2016.
We emailed the Activist Mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, and told her that we didn’t see evidence on her website that Gibson was actively campaigning for Jones. She did not provide additional evidence to bolster her claim.
Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Jones’ campaign, told PolitiFact that Gibson has played no role in Jones’ campaign.
""Her name is nowhere in our volunteer database, we have no indication she ever contributed,"" he says. ""We have no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with our campaign.""",0,Activist Mommy
"""Obama voted to support President Bush between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years."" On the campaign trail, Sen. Barack Obama regularly criticizes President Bush's ""failed policies"" and leadership abilities. On the floor of the Senate, however, the freshman from Illinois is much less contrary than his rhetoric would suggest.
Responding to Obama's criticisms of Sen. John McCain's 95 percent presidential support score in 2007, McCain's campaign on June 3, 2008, sent a mass e-mail noting that Obama's own presidential support score is higher than one might think.
The e-mail cited vote studies compiled by Congressional Quarterly to note that Obama voted to support President Bush's positions between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers also noted that Obama voted with his party more than 95 percent of the time during that period, while McCain was more independent, tallying party unity scores between 70 and 90 percent.
""Can you imagine Obama touting his record of supporting President Bush half the time? Well, it's true by his numbers,"" Rogers said.
McCain's campaign is correct on both counts. Though Obama is a loyal Democrat who has opposed Bush on legislation more often than the average for his party in the Senate, running for president hasn't made him significantly more partisan. He opposed Bush 51 percent of the time in 2006 and 60 percent of the time in 2007.
In 2007, Obama found himself in Bush's camp on immigration policy; in a series of votes, Obama backed legislation, which failed, that would have provided a temporary guest worker program and new border security measures. Obama and Bush also were allied on legislation that raised the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over two years and provided $8.3-billion in small-business tax incentives. In 2006, as Obama was laying the foundation for his presidential bid, he supported the president's position on key votes dealing with immigration policy and on making permanent 14 provisions in the ""Patriot Act"" antiterrorism law.
All of which hardly makes Obama a full-blown Bush supporter. But his record also doesn't put him near the Senate's top 10 Bush foes — a list headed in 2007 by Democrats Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Barbara Boxer of California, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who each were opposed to Bush more than 65 percent of the time. Because Obama has shown a willingness to vote the administration's position on a number of occasions over the past two years, we rule the McCain campaign's claim True.",1,John McCain
"Says the Army is spending $7 million to sponsor a NASCAR team. Rep. Betty McCollum says the government wastes a remarkable amount of money sponsoring a NASCAR team -- $7 million a year.
""In 2011, the U.S. Army is sponsoring Ryan Newman's #39 Chevrolet Impala in the Spirit Cup series at a cost to the taxpayers of $7 million,"" McCollum, D-Minn., said in a statement.
A reader wondered whether this was true, so we looked into it.
The NASCAR sponsorship was cited many times during the recent House of Representatives deliberations on budget cuts. During one round of budget-cutting in February 2011, the House voted to slice more than $61 billion from the budget, but it spared the money that the Army pays to sponsor Newman's NASCAR team.
The Army has sponsored various NASCAR teams for many years and has sponsored Newman's for the past two years. Backers of the expenditure say sponsorship pays off in recruiting leads. ""Last year alone, the U.S. Army's motor sports programs generated more than 46,000 qualified leads, more than 1,300 pledges of support from key business and community leaders, and more than 484 million media impressions (34 million of which offered specific Army recruiting messages),"" said Newman in a website discussion. A spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing confirmed that the Army pays $7.4 million for its co-sponsorship. The team's website quotes Newman saying that he is energized by the sponsorship.
""Being around the U.S. Army soldiers is an inspiration to me and the race team,"" he said. ""The physical, emotional and mental strength of these individuals is a driving force behind our mission to get the soldier’s car into Victory Lane.""
But to McCollum the sponsorship is too much.
""Taxpayer-funded NASCAR race cars are an absurdity at a time when the Republican-Tea Party is cutting federal support for homeless veterans, law enforcement officers, and firefighters,"" McCollum said in a press release announcing her proposed amendment.
""With trillion dollar deficits, this amendment is where the rubber meets the road for my Republican Tea Party colleagues,"" she said. But her amendment failed.
We won't weigh in on the debate over whether the Army's money is well spent or not.",1,Betty McCollum
"""If you are African-American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have."" During a Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. on Jan. 21, 2008, John Edwards elaborated on his vision of ""two Americas"" and showed empathy toward an important bloc of Democratic primary voters by pointing out racial disparities in net worth.
It came during a discussion about whether subprime lenders were targeting the most economically vulnerable people. He said he didn't know their motivations, but added:
""What they have done is targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families,"" Edwards said. ""And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African-American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.
""This is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.""
It appears the former North Carolina senator was relying on figures from the U.S. Census Bureau.
In 2000, the median net worth of a household headed by a non-Hispanic white adult was $79,400. The median net worth of a household run by a black adult was $7,500. The figure for Hispanic households was $9,750. These figures are based on a 2003 report.
Net worth is measured as the total value of a household's financial assets — such as bank accounts, property and vehicles — minus the household's financial liabilities. Though the measurement is an oft-used indicator of financial health, it doesn't always tell the whole story because the amount of income generated by a household's assets is a key factor in maintaining a desired standard of living.
Still, because Edwards correctly cites Census data showing a tenfold disparity between black and white net worth, we judge his statement True.
UPDATE: This corrects our first version, which mistakenly used the term family income when we meant net worth.",1,John Edwards
"Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face ""until Trump gets fired from office."" A story about recording artist Lady Gaga announcing she would cover her face until President-elect Donald Trump is out of office appears to be masking the truth.
A Nov. 25, 2016, post on TheRightists.com claimed that Gaga — née Stefani Germanotta — revealed her protest plan on a CBS Sunday Morning interview.
The original post, with the headline ""Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again ‘Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More,’"" was temporarily missing after the interview aired , but has reappeared. The story also was posted practically verbatim on several other sites .
After a brief synopsis of Gaga saying she lamented losing her privacy to the paparazzi as a pop singer, the post quoted her as saying she was opposed to a Trump presidency.
""I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House,"" the story quoted her as saying. She allegedly told CBS correspondent Lee Cowan that she had moved past ""wearing a mask"" as she had done with elaborate costumes earlier in her career. She thought Trump was a real monster who would drive her back to the practice, whether it was with makeup or an actual mask.
""I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,"" the story quoted her as saying.
""Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask.""
While Gaga did appear in a CBS Sunday Morning segment on Nov. 27 , the idea that she announced a new kind of poker face turned out to be a bald-faced lie.
She said no such thing in the nine-minute interview. We also could find no mention of it on her profiles at Twitter , Facebook or Instagram , or her website . (Our inquiries to her Interscope Records label and CBS News went unanswered.)
Gaga, a Hillary Clinton supporter, did make a number of moves after Election Day, protesting Trump’s victory in front of Trump Tower , signing a Change.org petition asking Republican electors to switch their votes to Clinton and recently admonishing Melania Trump’s ""hypocrisy"" for the future first lady’s plans for an anti-bullying campaign.
Gaga also really discussed with Cowan how she felt trapped in a bad romance with her public persona, unable to freely express herself outside of her own home:
""I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I’m not free anymore. As soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It’s legal to follow me. It’s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can’t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long, hard look at that property line, and I said, ‘Well, you know, if I can’t be free out there, I can be free in here.’""
The Nov. 25 story on TheRightists.com used similar, but not identical, wording before launching into the alleged Trump tirade. It’s possible the site was able to lift the initial gist of the interview before it aired thanks to a Nov. 23 preview of the segment on CBSNews.com.
The site bills itself as a ""HYBRID site of news and satire,"" and that ""part of our stories already happens, part, not yet."" It also admits that ""NOT all of our stories are true!""
There was no indication which part of the Gaga story might be true and which part was not. Other sites that posted the story didn’t specify, either. That gives us a million reasons to find their claims unreliable.",0,Bloggers

""Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as ‘AMLO,’ has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise… Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention,"" the story reads.
The story used a quote of López Obrador for which they cited the Daily Caller to back up their point:
"" ‘And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,’ López Obrador said, adding that immigrants ‘must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.’ He then declared it as ‘a human right we will defend.’ ""
We found the original quote in the Mexican newspaper,  El Universal .  It has been taken out of context.
""Y ya pronto, muy pronto, al triunfo de nuestro movimiento vamos a defender a los migrantes de todo el continente Americano y todos los migrantes del mundo que, por necesidad, tienen que abandonar sus pueblos para buscar la vida en Estados Unidos, es un derecho humano que vamos a defender,"" El Universal quotes López Obrador saying in a speech on June 19.
That translates to: ""Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States; it’s a human right we will defend.""
López Obrador is not telling anyone to flood the border, but saying that he will defend those who find themselves with no other option but to relocate to the United States. The quote was delivered in the wake of news of the Trump administration’s rampant separation of families at the border. Over 2,300 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9, according to the Homeland Security Department.
We found no indications that López Obrador was encouraging people to abandon their towns in favor of the United States. Instead, he urged current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to complete the following three actions:
Send a diplomatic note in protest of the Trump’s administration’s policies to the United States;
Solicit the urgent intervention of the United Nations commissioner for human rights; and,
Send a team of lawyers, psychologists and social workers to aid kids and their parents at the border.

No credible media sources repeated the story. Also, the fact-checking website Snopes.com , called it out as ""False"" on March 11, 2017.
As is the case with several other claims checked before by PolitiFact, this fake news claim originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org .

-- Pelosi participated in a press conference on March 24, 2017 in Washington D.C. reacting to the GOP’s failed bid to repeal Obamacare
-- Pelosi attended a town hall meeting with constituents in San Francisco on March 25, 2017
-- Pelosi called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, to recuse himself from the panel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election

You don't have to guess what I'll do as president. Just look at what I've done.""
We have previously explored Biden's claims about his Iraq plan, so here we will focus on his statement that when Pakistan erupted, he spoke with President Pervez Musharraf before Bush did.
Indeed, Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 6, according to a statement from his office that day and wide news coverage of contacts with Musharraf.
In the statement, Biden described it as ""a very frank and detailed discussion.  I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan.""
President Bush spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 7, one day after Biden did. At a press availability that day at Mount Vernon, Bush's remarks were very similar to Biden's the day before. ""My message was that we believe strongly in elections, and that you ought to have elections soon, and you need to take off your uniform,"" Bush said. ""You can't be the president and the head of the military at the same time. So I had a very frank discussion with him.""
It's not clear why Bush didn't speak with Musharraf until after Biden, but the records indicate that Biden's claim is True.",1,Joe Biden
"""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings."" Lester Holt asked the major presidential candidates in their first debate how they would heal the nation’s racial divide, exacerbated by police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.
Democrat Hillary Clinton called for a top-to-bottom re-examination of the criminal justice system to prevent uneven treatment of minorities under the law.
Republican Donald Trump, stuck to his ""law and order"" approach, painting a bleak portrait of life for African-Americans and Hispanics ""living in hell because it’s so dangerous.""
He zeroed in on Chicago, President Barack Obama’s hometown.
""In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings,"" Trump said.
Has Chicago had thousands of shootings so far this year?
Trump’s campaign showed us an article published on Forbes Sept. 8 that says of Chicago, ""In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and 2016′s figure already stands at 2,949.""
The Chicago Tribune, which tracks neighborhood crimes through its Crime in Chicagoland project, has data supporting that shooting count for 2015.
And as far as this year goes? From Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, there have been 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune.
The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers, so numbers will not match those tracked by the city. ""One shooting incident may have multiple victims, but it still counts officially as only one shooting,"" the Chicago Tribune site says.
Even then, data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2,521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept. 18.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept. 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it, outlining a need for more policing, more jobs and crime prevention.
""Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable. ... It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together,"" Emanuel said, according to the  Tribune . ""For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans, the violence that is happening corrodes our core. It is not the Chicago we know, and it is not the Chicago we love.""
While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015, it’s important to note that they do not represent homicides, experts told us. (However, the Tribune’s count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides.)
""The word ‘shooting’ does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime,"" said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake.
A shooting is simply a gun being fired, not someone being shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia.
The city’s numbers are striking, but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago, mirroring the national trend.
When you have a flare-up in gang warfare in any community, there will be large increases in gun homicides, and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York, Cornell said.
""There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the U.S. and is atypical of other large cities, so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the U.S.,"" Cornell added.
A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects, said George A. Mocsary, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law.
""Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs,"" Mocsary said.",1,Donald Trump
"Says Donald Trump ""started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans."" After years of repeating conspiracies that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Donald Trump finally backed away from the so-called birther movement earlier this month .
But that didn’t stop the question from coming up during a key exchange at Monday’s presidential debate in New York.
Hillary Clinton said Trump embraced a ""racist lie"" and it demonstrated a pattern that carried over from his business practices.
""Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans,"" she said.
That’s quite the charge, but is it true?
Yes. It turns out he was.
In 1973, Trump, as a 27-year-old, was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management. It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. By all accounts, including his own, Trump was a hands-on president and very active in managing the day-to-day business operations.
That year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race.
""The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,"" the complaint reads.
Black people, the government found, were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent.
In one instance, a black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18, 1972, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot.
The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government said the company’s comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said ""C"" for ""colored"" to every application submitted by a person of color.
Trump vehemently denied the claims, which he called ""absolutely ridiculous,"" according to a 1973 New York Times article . Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit.
Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But he did offer an explanation in the debate.
""As far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued,"" Trump said. ""We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.""
Indeed, both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle. Trump claimed victory, writing in his 1987 memoir,  Art of the Deal : ""In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt""
However, under the agreement, Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements.
It’s also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly -- ""north of 98 percent,"" Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law, previously told PolitiFact . And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt.
""That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence"" against Trump, Schwemm said.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""President Trump just told Paul Ryan, ‘You’re fired.’"" PolitiFact Wisconsin examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life.""
President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have had their differences ever since Trump emerged as the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican nomination.
But once Trump won the election, Ryan has generally praised the former host of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" TV show.
And a major clash between the two GOP leaders certainly would lead the news.
Yet we don’t recall a headline like this one in any mainstream news source:
""BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired.’""
(""You’re fired"" was Trump’s catchphrase on the show.)
The headline was on an article posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org on March 14, 2017 (10 days before the Republican plan to replace Obamacare collapsed, with some conservatives blaming Ryan). The site operators describe themselves as ""a group of educated, God-fearing Christian conservative patriots.""
The headline and article were also posted the same day on a site called usanewspost.us, which presents an overlay of photos of scantily clad women when you go to its home page.
But not on any other site that we could find -- much less a reputable news source.
An aside, before we dig in: Roughly two-thirds of the statements made by bloggers that have been rated by PolitiFact have received a False or Pants on Fire. That includes a handful made by TheLastLineOfDefense.org.
Its site carries a disclaimer that says its articles ""may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
But you don't necessarily get that impression from any one article.
In this case, the article begins by quoting a statement from ""Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP"" as saying Trump ""will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming (sic) loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault.""
We couldn’t find any connection between Trump’s White House and any person with that name or anything called WHOIP.
The article, which doesn’t spell out what precipitated Trump’s alleged statement, ends by stating that Trump approached Ryan at a luncheon and told him: ""Mr. Speaker, you’re fired.""
It goes without saying that if Trump had had such an encounter with Ryan, it would have been widely reported.
One operator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org responded to our request for information to back up the statement by referring us to the site's disclaimer notice.
In January 2017, BuzzFeed News reported that according to that man, identified as Zeke Wilekenmeyer, the site is ""an elaborate trolling operation aimed at conservatives.""
Ryan press secretary Ian Martorana told us: ""That headline is pure fiction.""",0,Bloggers
"""Barack Obama ... 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line."" In the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Republican Gov. Sarah Palin tried to take a hammer to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama’s postpartisan campaign tack.
“Now, Barack Obama, of course, he’s pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line,” Palin said, questioning whether he could reduce polarization in Washington.
In fact, Obama — who joined the Senate in 2005 — has voted with his party 96 percent of the time, according to a study by
Congressional Quarterly
. CQ’s calculation of party unity measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. By comparison, rival Sen. John McCain has voted with his fellow Republicans at an 81 percent clip over the entire Bush presidency.
But as PolitiFact has reported before , voting studies can be skewed depending on a lot of factors, such as attendance, the roll-call votes picked and the issues that arise during the course of the year. Some congressional sessions may have more head-to-head party line votes than others.
Examining votes that matched the position of President Bush — the titular head of the GOP — shows McCain has supported him 90 percent of the time, while Obama has gone along 40 percent, CQ found.
But the question here is if it's true that Obama voted along party lines 96 percent of the time, and that claim is True.",1,Sarah Palin
"""Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters."" Police in Charlottesville, Va., arrested an Ohio man in connection with the hit-and-run death of a woman protesting a white supremacist rally, but an online post alleged authorities were covering up for the real culprit.
An Aug. 12, 2017, post on PuppetStringNews.com carried the headline, ""Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters."" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of efforts to combat fake news.
Police arrested James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio , after a 2010 Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested.
PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said police had the wrong man. The post said the Challenger actually belonged to a Michigan man named Jerome Vangheluwe (pronounced ""vangelloway,"" with a hard g), who had a son named Joel Vangheluwe, who was ""a known Antifa supporter.""  Antifa is shorthand for antifascist demonstrators that organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence.
""This James Alex Fields subject is simply being used to make it look like a Right Wing attack, when he has no ties to the Dodge Challenger that was used...Unlike the Vangheluwe family who owns the car,"" the post read.
But the post, which appears to get its roots from an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories, is based on inaccurate information.
Here’s what we know.
A statement from the city of Charlottesville said the Challenger rear-ended a sedan, which in turn hit a minivan, pushing the minivan into an intersection filled with pedestrians.
""The Dodge Challenger fled the scene, but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police,"" the statement read .
Fields was identified by police as the driver and was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14 .
Fields was photographed at the Charlottesville rally , and news reports said he had told his mother in Ohio that he was going there . A former high school teacher also noted Fields had shown an unusual interest in Nazi history .
But what about the car supposedly belonging to the Vangheluwes?
We checked vehicle records and found that it did once belong to Jerome Vangheluwe, who bought it in 2009. Joel Vangheluwe had posted a photo of the Challenger on Oct. 16, 2011 , with the caption ""My car when I turn 16.""
But Jerome Vangheluwe sold the car in 2012. It then went to another owner for almost three years. It was sold again on May 13, 2016, and registered under its current Ohio license plate, GVF 1111, which has been shown in photos from Charlottesville. News reports concur the car is registered to Fields.
After the posts blaming Joel Vangheluwe started appearing, he posted Facebook status updates on Aug. 12 denying he was the driver.
""im not the one, im from fucking michigan you idiots,"" he first posted. His Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home . Vangheluwe followed that with, ""i drive a 2009 chevy impala, not a challenger, fuck the internet""
The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe.",0,PuppetStringNews.com
"Says she condemned violence at a campaign stop in Arizona in March. In the wake of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., much of the public discussion focused on whether political rhetoric has grown too heated.
Giffords is a Democratic representative from a conservative-leaning district. During the 2010 election, Republicans believed Giffords' seat and others like it were likely wins for their party. Republican Sarah Palin included the district on a map that put the crosshairs of a gun sight over selected districts held by Democrats. Back in March, Giffords herself said in an interview that political rhetoric was growing too heated, and specifically mentioned the map. ""For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list. But the thing is, the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize there's consequences to that action."" (A Palin spokeswoman said they were surveyors marks, not crosshairs.)
To be clear, there's no evidence so far that shooter, Jared Loughner, was involved in politics or even saw the map. Still, some have criticized Palin the wake of the Tuscon shooting for using gun imagery regularly in her public comments.
Several days later, on Jan. 12, 2011, Palin responded to the criticism with a video statement posted to her Facebook account.
""Like millions of Americans I learned of the tragic events in Arizona on Saturday, and my heart broke for the innocent victims. No words can fill the hole left by the death of an innocent, but we do mourn for the victims' families as we express our sympathy,"" Palin said in her statement.
But Palin also rejected those who would blame her.
""Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own,"" Palin said. ""They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies, not with those who proudly voted in the last election."" She added that ""journalists and pundits"" were manufacturing a ""blood libel"" that political rhetoric somehow played a part in the shooting.
Palin then noted that she has publicly condemned violence.
""As I said while campaigning for others last March in Arizona during a very heated primary race, 'We know violence isn't the answer. When we ""take up our arms"", we're talking about our vote.' Yes, our debates are full of passion, but we settle our political differences respectfully at the ballot box – as we did just two months ago, and as our Republic enables us to do again in the next election, and the next,"" Palin said.
We wanted to know the context of her comments and if Palin was giving an accurate rendering of them.
We found that Palin was referring to comments she made at a campaign stop with Sen. John McCain in Tuscon. Palin was supporting McCain, who was facing a primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth.
""And hearing the news reports lately, kind of this ginned up controversy about us common-sense conservatives inciting violence because we happen to oppose some of the things in the Obama administration,"" Palin said. ""We know violence isn't the answer. When we take up our arms, we are talking about our vote. We're talking about being involved in a contested primary like this and picking the right candidate, too, John McCain. We thank you for that. But this BS coming from the 'lame stream media' about us inciting violence -- don't let the conversation be diverted. Don't let a distraction like that get you off track. Keep fighting hard for these candidates who are all about the common-sense conservative solutions that we need.""
Palin said that back in March she condemned violence and said, ""We know violence isn't the answer. When we 'take up our arms', we're talking about our vote."" We checked the transcript and found that was the case.",1,Sarah Palin
"""Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook 'Signature.' "" A conspiracy-minded website attempted to cast doubt on evidence presented by one of eight women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct in a misleading headline days ahead of the Alabama Senate race.
""WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO),"" the headline reads on The Gateway Pundit. We found similar posts on Breitbart, "" Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook ,"" and on the blog Silence is Consent, "" Roy Moore accuser admits she forged yearbook inscription .""
Beverly Young Nelson accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16 years old and he, in his 30s, was the deputy district attorney of Etowah County. As evidence, Nelson presented a note she said Moore wrote in her high school yearbook before the incident took place. Nelson has been represented by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred.
The inscription reads, ""To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A.""
Below the signature reads 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.
Moore’s defenders have pointed out the date and place seem to have been written in different ink and handwriting than the note.
In a Dec. 8 Good Morning America  interview with Nelson about Moore’s response to the allegations (he denies them) and her experience since taking her story public, Nelson addressed the inconsistency. Nelson said she added the date and place of the inscription.
""He signed your yearbook?"" ABC News reporter Tom Llamas asked Nelson.
""He did sign it,"" Nelson said.
""And you made some notes underneath?"" Llamas asked.
""Yes,"" Nelson said.
""Nelson said she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore,"" the video voiceover says.
To summarize, Nelson says she added the time and location to the inscription. But she says the note and signature was from Moore.
That’s not what the headlines of the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart or Silence is Consent. All three say Nelson said she either tampered with Moore’s signature or forged the inscription.
There’s no evidence of that.
Yet, the Gateway Pundit wrote that ""Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin,"" the story reads. ""Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud.""
Fox News made a similar misstatement in their headline and story about the ABC report, which they later walked back.
""Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate,"" the original Fox News headline read . It was later edited to say she wrote , rather than forged, part of the inscription. The story did not include a clarification or correction when we last looked at it.
The original Fox News story also said Nelson ""wrote part of the disputed note"" without specifying what she wrote, whereas the edited version clarified that ""she added the date and place in the inscription.""",0,Bloggers
"Under the compromise tax agreement, ""99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax."" While the debate over the compromise tax agreement proposed by President Barack Obama has focused mostly on Bush's income tax cuts and whether they ought to be extended to wealthy Americans, the issue of estate taxes has also become a sticking point for some legislators.
Under the plan, the estate tax rate would be set at 35 percent, with an effective exemption of $5 million.
Many Republicans had hoped to do away with the estate tax altogether, and Democrats last year had proposed a higher rate: 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million.
The compromise has ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True .
Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, ""99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.""
According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center , Sanders is correct.
The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.
Under the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.
Estate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.
But the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.
Last year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).
Sanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill."" Hillary Clinton used the gun debate to try and attack Sen. Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate.
Sanders’ record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his vote shielding firearms companies from lawsuits, Clinton brought up another time Sanders didn’t side with gun control advocates.
""The majority of our country supports background, and even the majority of gun owners do,"" Clinton said on Oct. 13. ""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill.""
Clinton is correct that most Americans ( 90 percent ) support background checks. But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases?
Five nays from the Vermont congressman
The Clinton campaign pointed to our July fact-check of an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC. We rated a slightly more expansive claim — ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, background checks and waiting periods"" — Mostly True . (That statement that referred specifically to background checks, which Sanders had supported.)
Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times:
1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.
2. The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.
3. After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period . In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day, but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).
4. He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why .
5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.
In July, when we first looked into the issue, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents.
""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""
A mixed record overall
Overall, Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an anti-gunner. He’s received lukewarm marks from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F in the last 15 years.
""Throughout his time in public office, Sen. Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminals,"" Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us.
Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons , closing the gun show loophole , regulating high capacity magazines , and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown massacre.
On the flip side, Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks , though his most recent pro-gun vote was in 2009.
""(Sanders’) gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 years,"" Garrison Nelson, a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont, told us in July. ""Vermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose, not one another.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"In 2007, ""the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" which is ""more than the entire bottom 50 percent."" On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests from readers to fact-check it, we decided to do just that.
We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil.
Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans.
""Mr. President, in the year 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" Sanders said. ""The top 1 percent earned 23.5 percent of all income--more than the entire bottom 50 percent. That is apparently not enough. The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent has nearly tripled since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent earned about 8 percent of all income. In the 1980s, that figure jumped to 14 percent. In the late 1990s, that 1 percent earned about 19 percent.""
To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that ""the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" which is ""more than the entire bottom 50 percent.""
When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, ""Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)."" We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent ""has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007."" An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007.
In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us.
Still, we've looked at a similar question before , so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere.
One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said.
Another study , published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said.
The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of ""income"" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. ""There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes,"" he said.
So, we're left with three studies that vary slightly but which all point in the same general direction -- showing the top 1 percent earning between 21.4 and 23.5 percent of the national income in 2007. The studies also show that this share exceeds what the entire bottom 50 percent of the United States earns.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy."" In his response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that government spending has reached a tipping point.
""We face a crushing burden of debt,"" Ryan said. ""The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in years ahead.""
We at PolitiFact and our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio have both considered essentially identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.
The most recent of those statements, which came during a speech in the House of Representatives on Jan. 5, 2011, was that ""our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy.""
In its most basic interpretation, the United States government’s total debt at the start of the year was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive ""Debt to the Penny"" website.
The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases.
Using these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. That means $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy, which to us signals the onset of an eclipse.
Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, ""Wait!"" We understand.
There is an alternative measure of debt known as ""public debt,"" which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Using this measure instead, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. If current practices aren’t changed, public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December.
Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector. But one measure ""isn’t more 'right' than the other,"" Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, told us last March. ""Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way.""
Even if the smaller number -- public debt -- were to approach a total eclipse in a decade, ""to me, that counts as 'soon,'"" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. That’s because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions ""to turn the budget ship around,"" he said.
We'll note that these numbers have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.
We'll also note that these numbers could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we considered Boehner's statistics valid, and Ryan's formulation is equally solid.",1,Paul Ryan
"""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day"" After an Ohio high school student’s suspension notice was posted on social media, claims went viral that he was suspended for not participating in National Walkout Day one month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas.
""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day,"" a Fox News headline stated March 16. The Associated Press had a similar headline: ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts.""
Many right-leaning websites repeated the story about Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, located in a suburb of Columbus, with hashtags such as #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder and #DefendThe2nd.
Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
Shoemaker’s suspension notice, posted on social media by a friend, stated: ""student refused to follow instructions after being warned repeatedly by several administrators.""
While some social media posts presented the situation as the school punishing a student for refusing to call for gun control, the situation was actually more nuanced.
Shoemaker was suspended following National Walkout Day when thousands of students nationwide walked out of school one month after the massacre in Parkland to protest gun violence and call for gun control.
The first paragraph of the Fox News story shows that Shoemaker didn’t want to follow the alternative for students who didn’t want to attend the walkout:
""An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall.""
Shoemaker told Fox News that he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate so he chose to stay in the classroom and do school work instead.
""They presented the situation of the national walkout in such a way to where it really seemed they were forcing me to make a choice, a political choice in the classroom,"" he said. ""I didn’t like that I was going to have to decide whether I was anti-violence and pro-gun control or if I was to stay inside and be pro-gun violence, effectively. It didn’t feel right to have to make that decision.""
Shoemaker’s father Scott Shoemaker posted a message on Facebook March 16:
""My son was suspended for not leaving the room to either join a demonstration or reporting to the commons. He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of, but staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service.
""This had nothing to do with his own political beliefs, but with politics in school in general. Students should not have been forced to leave their classrooms, choose a side, and be politically divided. He got support from students on both sides of the political aisle after returning today, but he felt there were other students and staff angry with him for taking this position.""
Fox News reported a statement from the school: ""As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. .... This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location.""
We found the school’s full statement on its website , which stated that no students were forced to participate in the walkout.
""In fact, student participation overall was well under 50 percent of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings. Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment.""
School spokeswoman Stacie Raterman told PolitiFact that students opting not to attend the walkout were able to go to supervised study halls in different classrooms and the commons area. She said she couldn’t comment on any individual student’s discipline due to federal privacy laws but said about a dozen students at Davidson were suspended after attending the memorial gathering but not returning to class.
A Fox News network spokeswoman did not have any additional comment.",1,Bloggers
"Says she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis. Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street -- but in her 2016 campaign, she’s been striking populist tones.
Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go ""beyond Dodd-Frank"" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08.
She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis.
""As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up,"" she said. ""I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.""
Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis.
So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis?
The 2008 primary campaign
While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year.
Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007 . She said too many people were ignoring warning signs.
""The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,"" Clinton said. ""It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families.""
She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures.
In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders.
""I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine,"" she said. ""You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ ""
It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007.
The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa.  (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.)
""We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products,"" she said. ""You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought.""
In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution.
And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: ""So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent.""
This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the  New York Times .
At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation . The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections.
After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008.",1,Hillary Clinton
"The U.S. is spending ""one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan."" Jon Huntsman announced June 21, 2011 that he is running for the Republican nomination for president. Huntsman was previously governor of Utah but also recently served in the Obama administration as ambassador to China.
How is it that Huntsman is running against a president he served? Huntsman has said several times that when a president asks him to serve his country, he serves. He expanded on the point on Wednesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe .
""The president is a good man. He's earnest, he's hard working, he's a great family man,"" Huntsman said. ""But I got to say on the economy, we're not near where we should be, and internationally we're in places I believe we should not be, spending one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan. And I'm here to tell you that America's future is not going to be won or lost in the prairies of Afghanistan. It's going to be won or lost based upon our ability to compete in the 21st century crowds of Pacific.""
We were interested in fact-checking Huntsman's statement, which he repeated in other interviews, that one out of every six Defense Department dollars goes to Afghanistan.
To do that, we turned to government budget data and an array of defense spending policy experts. It turns out there are a number of ways to slice up the defense budget, and you get slightly different numbers depending on which you choose. You could consider the current fiscal year, 2011, or the one that starts in October, which is 2012. You could also consider authorizations (the legal limits for spending) or appropriations (the money actually approved within the legal limits).
We contacted the Huntsman campaign for its source, and it referred us to testimony from Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank. Haass testified at a U.S. Senate hearing in May; he opposed continuing the war in Afghanistan, which he said had now evolved into a war of choice.
""Just to be clear, wars of choice are not wrong per se. But before undertaking one, it is essential to demonstrate that the likely benefits of using military force will outweigh the costs and produce better results at less cost than other policies. Afghanistan does not meet these tests. It is not a major terrorist haven, and it should not be assumed it will again become one even if the Taliban make inroads,"" said Haass in his written testimony .
Haass said that if terrorists renewed their activities in Afghanistan, the United States could respond as it has done in countries such as Yemen and Somalia.
""At the macro or global level, Afghanistan is simply absorbing more economic, military, human, diplomatic and political resources of every sort than it warrants. The $110 to $120 billion annual price tag -- one out of every six to seven dollars this country spends on defense -- is unjustifiable given the budget crisis we face and the need for military (especially air and naval) modernization,"" Haass said.
We ran the one-in-six number by several defense spending experts who said Huntsman was either correct or close to it.
""He is correct. In the current fiscal year (fiscal year 2011), Congress has appropriated a total of $689 billion for the Department of Defense. Of that, $113.5 billion is for operations in Afghanistan,"" said Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, via e-mail.
Another expert, Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said you could choose to exclude money that goes to the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons budget as well as money that goes to military construction, and then the Afghanistan spending would be between one sixth and one fifth of Defense Department dollars.
Huntsman said we're spending ""one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan."" Budget numbers and defense spending experts said that's a reasonable extrapolation, though there are slightly different ways to calculate it as a little more or a little less. Still, Huntsman's number is a legitimate calculation.",1,Jon Huntsman
"""There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap."" During an interview with Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed one of the challenges of the current economy -- that job vacancies exist, but many people who aren’t working aren’t qualified to fill them. Her comments came during a week that the White House had devoted to messages about the American workforce.
""There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap,"" she said.
When we took a closer look, we found that Trump was generally on target, but that the impact of the ""skills gap"" -- the fact that many potential workers don’t have the right qualifications to take jobs that are currently open -- is worth some explanation.
Are there 6 million jobs available?
On the numerical side, Trump was spot-on.
Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey , or JOLTS. One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally.
In the most recent month for which data is available -- April 2017 -- the survey found 6,044,000 job openings across the country. That represents the first time this statistic has ever crossed the 6 million line, going back to the earliest data reported in 2000.
Since a measure of the raw number of job openings is affected by overall population growth over time, we’ll also note that the rate of job openings -- which is adjusted for the size of the U.S. population -- also tied a record in April, reaching a level equaled only in two previous months going back to 2000.
So Trump has accurately portrayed the scale of how many jobs are available today in the United States.
Is this large number of job openings 'due in part to the skills gap'?
Trump used cautious wording; Economists agree that a mismatch of skills is clearly a ""part"" of the problem, as she put it. That said, they cautioned against making the oversimplified argument that the skills gap underlies all 6 million job openings.
On the one hand, ""some of the current job vacancies are unquestionably due to the skills gap,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""If job-seeking jobless workers and promotion-seeking but under-employed workers had exactly the right skills, many of the current job vacancies could be filled faster.""
At the same time, for many job openings, the barrier isn’t necessarily the lack of a college degree or specialized training, he said. In many cases, the ""barrier"" can be overcome with on-the-job training and experience.
""There are many job openings with more modest skill requirements,"" Burtless said. ""They require the new hire to learn some extra skills to become more proficient and productive in their new jobs. A large percentage of job seekers have the capacity to learn those skills on the job pretty quickly.""
He added that ""employers who think every job opening can be filled immediately and with a perfectly trained worker are either living in a dream world or living through a Great Depression in which millions of highly trained workers are desperately seeking a job."" The reality, he said, is that ""for most current job vacancies, the skill set of today’s job seekers is sufficient to fill the great majority of the vacancies.""
Another economist, Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, has testified that for many manufacturing jobs, a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an ""image gap.""
Millennials in particular, she said, may have a ""tainted"" image of what high-tech manufacturing jobs look like today, assuming instead that they are like such jobs decades ago -- ""dirty, grimy, repetitive or dangerous."" Survey data shows that ""many workers are no longer interested in manufacturing jobs and there appears to be a stigma attached to manufacturing work,"" she wrote. ""Few parents want their children to work in this industry, and manufacturing is the last career choice for people between the ages of 19 and 33.""
In an interview, Mathur said it’s difficult to tease out how much of a factor the skills gap is in today’s job openings. She suggested that it may be the biggest factor -- but she also cautioned that the image gap is particularly significant for younger workers and added that other issues exist as well, including an unwillingness among some Americans to relocate to areas with jobs.
And of course, even in an efficiently humming economy, any survey taken at a given point in time will find many jobs that are simply open due to transition, or what economists call ""churn."" Many of these job openings will be due to happenstance rather than structural problems with the skills gap.",1,Ivanka Trump
"Says in Chicago, ""we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A."" New York and Los Angeles beat out Chicago as the nation’s most populous cities. But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN.
That was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high?
Without uniform gun policies — say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin — weapons still flow, Emanuel said.
""We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.,"" he said.
Emanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama's  White House chief of staff, is part of a group of mayors that’s fighting for stricter national gun laws.
We were curious: Does America’s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures?
Chicago’s guns
We talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel’s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago’s strict gun control rules won’t work by themselves.
(Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws don’t work , period.)
New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city.
""Chicago is not an island,"" McCaffrey said.
In the first six months of last year, the city — not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins — seized 3,912 guns. That’s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities’ police departments.
In Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a ""man with a gun"" or ""shots fired.""
In the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385.
That wasn’t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking.
For several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities.
""I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included,"" Webster said.
We pulled those reports from 1998 , 1999 and 2000 . Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons — more than the two larger cities together.
Why?
Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren’t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said.
Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law — people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws.
The same idea works for counties and cities.
In Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the New York Times reported, such as to Chuck’s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008.
The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a  New York Times  piece in 1999.",1,Rahm Emanuel
"Harambe received 15,000 votes in the presidential election. We all know Harambe as the late gorilla who became an Internet sensation, but is it possible one of America’s favorite memes also received 15,000 votes in this year’s presidential election?
Shortly following Donald Trump’s win, stories about Harambe winning thousands of votes appeared on social media, fueling funny remarks that the gorrilla spoiled the election.
For those of you who don’t know — Harambe, a silverback gorilla, was controversially killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in May after a young boy climbed into his enclosure. Harambe’s death sparked thousands of social media posts or memes memorializing his death.
""The Legend Of Harambe Continues As The Dead Gorilla Received Over 15,000 Votes For President,"" reads a Nov. 9 headline from Coed , an online entertainment magazine.
A post from 9GAG got over 79,000 reactions on Facebook.
And of course there were the social media posts:
While it’s possible a handful of people voted for Harambe (see here ), the stories that Harambe received thousands of votes — which ranges between 11,000 and 15,000 depending on the story — are not based on fact.
Why?
Write-in votes for Harambe would be treated like provisional or absentee ballots, meaning they wouldn’t be counted until after all the other votes, which takes weeks. We’re still counting votes in California, for instance .
Seeing as these Harambe stories popped up immediately after the election, there’s no way they were based on real data.
Plus, every state decides on their own requirements for write-in candidates, so not all votes for Harambe would count depending on the state.
More than 30 states require a write-in candidate to file paperwork in order to be an official candidate and at least eight states don’t even allow write-in candidates. The remaining states have no-filing requirements.
How many of these write-in votes actually get counted? Well, in 2012, 136,040 write-in votes were counted, which is .11-percent of the total votes, according to The Washington Post .",0,Bloggers
"""The top 25 hedge fund managers (are) making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined."" At her presidential campaign kick-off rally June 13, Hillary Clinton said the rich are getting richer, while many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Case in point: the disparity between Wall Street hedge fund managers and kindergarten teachers.
""While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet,"" she said, ""you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.""
Is the salary gap between kindergarten teachers and hedge fund managers really so wide? We decided to check it out. (We previously looked into a Clinton claim about taxes among the working class and the ultra-wealthy.)
Kindergarten teachers
The best data we could find on kindergarten teachers comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Other statistical sources, such as the National Center for Education Statistics , don’t separate out kindergarten teachers specifically.
According to a 2014 BLS report, there are about 158,000 kindergarten teachers in the United States. The figure includes teachers from both public and private schools, though it excludes special education instructors.
The average annual pay for a kindergarten teacher is $53,480 -- ranging from less than $34,000 to more than $78,000. This is higher than what the average preschool teacher makes, but slightly lower than that of elementary , middle and high school teachers.
So the aggregate pay for kindergarten teachers is about $8.5 billion.
For some historical context, Susan Moore Johnson, an education professor at Harvard University, said kindergarten teachers have traditionally been paid less than teachers at higher grade levels. But the implementation of district-wide pay scales has made pay mostly uniform across all grades within a district -- with exact salary varying based on experience and education, rather than the grade level. However, this is not the case in all districts.
Johnson added that, according to the National Center for Education Statistics , private school elementary teachers get paid, on average, several thousand dollars less than their public school counterparts.
So how does the $8.5 billion collective salary of America’s kindergarten teachers compare to the top-25 hedge fund managers’ take-home pay? This number is a little bit more elusive.
Hedge fund managers
In its 2015 ranking of the top-earning hedge fund managers, Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine said the group of 25 collectively earned $11.62 billion in compensation.
At the top of the list is Citadel founder and CEO Kenneth Griffin, who earned an estimated $1.3 billion off his fund.
Lest your jaw remain fully hinged, 2014 was a bad year. The magazine called the total $11.62 billion bounty ""paltry"" compared to what it was in 2013, when the top-25 hedge managers made about twice as much -- $21.15 billion.
There are, however, some issues with measuring hedge manager salaries, though the experts we polled couldn’t name a source that would necessarily be more accurate than Alpha magazine’s list.
The magazine’s report is just an estimate -- based on the manager’s capital gains in the fund, as well as his (the top 25 are all men) estimated share in the firm’s management and performance fees charged to clients.
These numbers are hard to verify because no one really knows for certain a manager’s stake in his or her firm, said Nicole Boyson , a finance professor at Northeastern University.
Additionally, funds charged to clients vary drastically among and within the different firms, and one would also have to account for how much of these fees go toward running the business, rather than the salary, Boyson said.
""If you could get comfortable with the ‘right’ number for a hedge fund manager, which I am not sure is possible, then you could compare it directly to the gross pay of teachers ... with the caveat that these two groups are likely subject to different tax rates, etc.,"" Boyson said.
In any case, the best information we have shows 25 hedge managers making about $3 billion more than the country’s 158,000 kindergarten teachers combined -- and that’s in a bad year for the hedge managers. The data here isn't perfect, but the gap between the two professions is so wide that it seems a safe bet that hedge fund managers make more.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent."" After Rudy Giuliani attacked Mitt Romney for rising crime rates in Massachusetts, Romney shot back: ""The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent. So he's wrong again on the facts.""
Take apart the FBI crime figures, and you'll see that Romney is right. But Giuliani is also right on a couple of points, particularly on rising murder and robberies. Here's how the numbers break down:
Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing FBI crime statistics in Massachusetts for 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed during the Romney administration.
To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims.
But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies.
Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9.
Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, an increase of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125.
So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent.
Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up.",1,Mitt Romney
"""It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office."" A headline exaggerates about a state appointment of an undocumented immigrant in California.
""It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office -- Trump has a better plan,"" said a May 10 headline on The Breaking Dawn .
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
While the story itself has some accurate information, the headline is misleading.
An undocumented immigrant, Lizbeth Mateo, did receive an official appointment by the state of California. But the headline creates a misleading impression by omitting key information about the nature of her post.
She is serving in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee, and she wasn’t the first undocumented immigrant to get such an appointment.
Mateo, a 33-year-old Los Angeles attorney, is a well-known immigrant activist . In 2013, she participated in a group called the Dream 9 , comprised of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who were raised in the United States. The group left for Mexico and then tried to re-enter the United States by seeking asylum as a protest. Mateo was held at a detention center in Arizona before she was released.
We found no contact information on the website of The Breaking Dawn, a site that is supportive of President Donald Trump and includes several stories raising alarm about ""illegal aliens.""
Mateo’s appointment
In March, the California Senate Rules Committee appointed Mateo to the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, known as Cal SOAP .
The committee advises the California Student Aid Commission on efforts to increase college access for poor students.
Mateo didn’t respond to an email and message from PolitiFact, but she told the media in a March statement that ""while undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.""
Appointees serve at the pleasure of the Senate Rules Committee, so she will serve until she is replaced or steps down, said Dan Reeves, chief of staff to Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León.
Mateo was appointed one day after Trump visited California and slammed the state’s sanctuary policies.
The Sacramento Bee reported that Mateo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and came to the United States with her parents when she was 14. She graduated from Santa Clara University School of Law in 2016 and passed the California bar exam the next year. (Undocumented immigrants are allowed to apply for the bar in California .)
The Senate initially announced that the appointment was a first for the state, but Senate officials later clarified that, in 2016, Gov. Jerry Brown named a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to the California State University Board of Trustees.
Reeves said that he believes Mateo is the first undocumented immigrant not protected by DACA to receive a statewide appointment.
Mateo told NPR that when she applied for DACA, the Obama administration wanted her to explain why she left the country during the Dream 9 protest. She said the administration denied her DACA application.
Some California lawmakers want to increase civic participation of undocumented immigrants. If it passes, SB 174 would allow for all California residents, including undocumented immigrants, to receive appointments to state and local boards and commissions that are not merely advisory.  Mateo was appointed to an advisory committee, so SB 174 would not affect that appointment, said Michael Soller, spokesman for state Sen. Ricardo Lara, a sponsor of the bill.",1,The Breaking Dawn
"Says the ""Pope calls for world wide gun confiscation except for the UN"" The Common Sense Show, an online program with the tagline ""Freeing America one enslaved mind at a time,"" took Pope Francis to task for his stance on weapons.
""The Pope has said we need to take away all guns -- total gun confiscation across the planet "" show host Dave Hodges said May 3, 2018 . ""But he does say the U.N. should be the only group that has guns.""
Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook .
We reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn’t hear back.
We searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it’s possible that he’s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope.
Address to the United Nations
Pope Francis spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015 . There, he called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and an end to ""violence against ethnic and religious minorities.""
Speaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people ""have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement.""
In that speech, Francis spoke of ""the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community.""
If that’s the source of Hodges’ statement, it doesn’t match what he described. There’s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions.
In fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms.
""To all those who unjustly use weapons in this world, I appeal: Put down your weapons of death; arm yourselves instead with justice, love, mercy and authentic guarantees of peace,"" he said August 2015 .
Pope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons.
In his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress , Francis also called for an end to the international arms trade.
Speech to teens in Turin, Italy
Hodges might have also reworked fake news that twisted remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people.
The pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry.
""People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?"" he said, as reported by Reuters .
In the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can’t be Christians.
We rated that interpretation Pants on Fire .",0,Common Sense News
"""I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment."" In an interview on MSNBC, Romney tried to turn the tables on his Republican rivals -- who have accused him of flip-flopping on various issues -- by saying he was more consistent on gay marriage than they have been.
He said, ""I don't think that Rudy (Giuliani) or Fred (Thompson) or John McCain support the marriage amendment. And I think they're in error on that one.""
Indeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban.
Giuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions.
McCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans.
Thompson has proposed a constitutional amendment that would not ban gay marriages, but would free states from the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law.
A spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor ""does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time."" Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, ""unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one.""",1,Mitt Romney
"Obama worked with ""Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons."" In a new television ad, Sen. Barack Obama makes the case for America leading international efforts to control nuclear weapons.
""The single most important national security threat that we face is nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists,"" Obama says in the ad. ""What I did was reach out to Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons. We have to lead the entire world to reduce that threat. We can restore America's leadership in the world.""
We checked into Obama's legislative record with Sen. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana.
Obama's first foreign travel as a U.S. senator was with Lugar in August 2005, when the two men visited nuclear weapons storage and dismantlement facilities in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.
The following spring, Lugar and Obama authored a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill does not specifically list different types of weapons of mass destruction, but we'll take as a given that it includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
The larger part of the legislation was a separate measure to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS.
The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007.
The Lugar-Obama initiative is modeled after a 1991 bill authored by Lugar and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn. The Nunn-Lugar program provided U.S. funding and expertise to the former Soviet Union to dismantle stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
We'll note here that the legislation Obama and Lugar sponsored did not deal solely with nuclear weapons, but rather with all weapons of mass destruction, and that a good bit of their legislation focused on conventional weapons. But it does seem like part of the legislation's intent is to ""help lock down loose nuclear weapons.",1,Barack Obama
"""That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay."" In her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin talked about her record as governor of Alaska.
She talked about ethics reform and cutting the state budget.
""While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for,"" Palin said. ""That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay.""
The state's jet plane was a major issue in the 2006 election, which Palin won. Then-incumbent Frank Murkowski had defied protests from members of the state Legislature and the public when he bought the jet in 2005 to travel around the state. His political opponents said the jet symbolized his arrogance and free-spending ways.
Palin defeated Murkowski in the Republican primary and then won the general election. She said during the campaign she would sell the jet, and one of her first orders on taking office was putting the it up for sale. And yep, the state decided to list it on eBay for an asking price of $2.5-million. (The state had paid just under $2.7-million for it in 2005.)
It wasn't as wacky as it sounds. The state had sold smaller aircraft previously on eBay. (Alaska is a large, rural state, and state officials do use aircraft to get around. But typically they use smaller, more rugged planes than Murkowski's jet.)
But the jet's eBay listing did not prove effective, and the state never got its asking price. Instead, in 2007, the state turned to an aircraft broker, Turbo North Aviation. The jet was purchased that year by businessman Larry Reynolds, the owner of a sporting goods store and marine supply store in Valdez. Reynolds paid $2.1-million.
So it's true that Palin put the plane up for sale on eBay, but it didn't sell on eBay. That's not a huge point, but it is worth noting.",1,Sarah Palin
"Three years ago, John McCain said, ""Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded."" Speaking to the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 27, 2008, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden questioned John McCain's judgment on U.S. progress in Afghanistan — cherry-picking a comment McCain made three years ago. Biden used McCain's assessment to nip at the Republican on his decisionmaking compared to Barack Obama's.
""Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only three years ago, 'Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded?' "" Biden said.
The McCain comment stems from an Oct. 31, 2005, appearance on the Charlie Rose talk show on PBS. He was asked about winning in Iraq. After discussing issues confronting that country, McCain concluded: ""Afghanistan, we don't read about anymore, because it's succeeded. And by the way, there's several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is.""
It wasn't the first time that year McCain lauded ""success"" in Afghanistan — but it was more unqualified than other assessments.
A couple of weeks later, on Nov. 10, 2005, McCain told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, ""One of the reasons why we don't see a lot about Afghanistan is because many of the successes — although we still have a long way to go through — that we have."" He added he would ""love to see more troops there.""
In February 2005, McCain suggested permanent military bases were needed, according to the Associated Press. His office later clarified that permanent bases were not necessarily required, but noted America had to remain in the country to remove the ""last vestiges"" of the Taliban and al-Qaida.
This year, McCain said he would support adding more U.S. and Afghan soldiers, strengthening the government there. He promised it would ""turn around the war in Afghanistan,"" where the Taliban have expanded attacks recently and American troops in July rose to 36,000, their highest level.
Although Biden was selective in his choice of McCain's words, he correctly quotes what McCain said three years ago. We rule his statement True.",1,Joe Biden
"""Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism."" The federal government tried to hide that a common vaccine given to children causes autism, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook.
""Now it’s official: FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism,"" stated a headline on truthcommand.com .
The story stated: ""For years, fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals, but this has all changed. Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears, but now it turns out they were right all along .""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the website misled readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the DTaP vaccine Tripedia manufactured in the past by Sanofi Pasteur.
DTaP , a vaccine given to children in multiple doses, stands for Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , getting those diseases is much riskier than getting the vaccine. Mild problems such as a fever or swelling are common, while severe problems such as a serious allergic reaction are so ""rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.""
The internet has been fueled with misinformation for years about a vaccine-autism link. A 1998 article in a British medical journal, the Lancet, claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism but in 2010, the Lancet retracted the study. Scientists have repeatedly debunked the myth that vaccines cause autism through peer-reviewed studies. And yet, the spread of misinformation continues -- including by Donald Trump before and during his race for president.
Vaccine pamphlet on adverse side effects
Truthcommand.com stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration admitted that autism is a potential side effect in an online pamphlet about Tripedia:
""Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting.""
But that section also includes a disclaimer about adverse events:
""Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.""
Through the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) , anyone can file a report: doctors, patients, family members -- and they don’t need proof that the event was caused by the vaccine. Government researchers examine the reports and turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine for more research.
Marie McCormick, an expert on child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the reporting system can be gamed.
When the measles-thimerosal-autism controversy first emerged, activists encouraged parents to report adverse events regardless of the duration of time since the vaccination and prior events such as previous indications of developmental problems.
What happened to the pamphlet on FDA’s website
Truthcommand.com suggested that the FDA had tried to hide the autism link by deleting this pamphlet from the FDA’s website.
But the FDA told PolitiFact that the pamphlet written by Sanofi Pasteur in 2005 wasn’t actually deleted -- the FDA archived it and sent PolitiFact a link to the pamphlet .
It’s no surprise that the pamphlet was archived on the FDA’s website because the vaccine hasn’t been available for many years.
Cristine K. Schroeder, a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, told PolitiFact that the company’s last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012.
""Tripedia is not in use today,"" she said.
The company’s pamphlets for current vaccines for DTaP, Daptacel, Pentacel and Quadracel, do not list autism as a potential adverse event. They do show data from clinical trials about side effects such as the percentage of children who got a fever, or became drowsy.
Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s, FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact. The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events. More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those ""for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.""
The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine, including Tripedia (DTaP), and autism or other developmental disorders, McSeveney said.
The truthcommand.com website states that it aims ""to raise awareness to issues ignored by the media."" We contacted the email address listed on the website and did not get a reply. Part way through our reporting the story was no longer accessible on the website. The misleading story has circulated at least since March 2016 when Snopes debunked it .

"""NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead."" Days before the Super Bowl, fake news articles circulating on Facebook claimed that a National Football League lawyer named Dan Goodes was shot dead in a ""gangland-style execution"" hours after blowing the whistle on the ""rigged Super Bowl.""
""NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged,’ found dead,"" stated the Feb. 1 headline on Eco News, a website that claims it is on the frontline for ""earth liberation.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story copies an earlier fake story by YourNewsWire , a website that publishes fake news. We sent messages to both websites and didn’t get a reply.
We found no evidence that an NFL lawyer named Dan Goodes even exists, or that he was found dead in his BMW in Manhattan.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told PolitiFact that the NFL has no attorney named Dan Goodes. He called the story ""ridiculous,"" ""bogus"" and ""fake.""
The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league.
""According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system,"" the article said.
The article included a mock screenshot of a Jan. 28 New York Times article about the alleged shooting of the lawyer founded slumped over the wheel of his BMW. But the article doesn’t appear in Nexis.
""Nothing about this is real, down to the URL,"" New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told PolitiFact. ""It's a false reference to a non-existent NYT story.""
The Eco News story included a photo of two police officers at a crime scene. We searched Google images and found it matched an Associated Press photo of a crime scene near the site where a police officer was fatally shot in the Bronx in July.
It also contained an alleged photo of NFL headquarters; however, a search of that photo in Google images resulted in a match to a picture on the South Park Studios website .
Other conspiracy theories about Super Bowl rigging
Readers should beware of other conspiracy theories about the Super Bowl. The Facebook page Satire Daily, which clearly identifies itself as satire , published a video seemingly documenting that the NFL had openly admitted to rigging games. Snopes debunked the claim in January.
The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team’s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars.
That actually happened. Referee Clete Blakeman did Brady a congratulatory pat on the chest , which fueled some conspiracy theories .
NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, ""It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game.""
Another situation that fueled conspiracy theories stemmed from an actual NFL ad on social media in January before the NFC Championship Game.
The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, ""When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!""
The NFL apologized for the ads.
""It was a regrettable mistake,"" an unnamed NFL spokesman told media . ""The ads were mocked up using all the (possible) combinations, but weren’t supposed to go until Monday when the matchup is known. Obviously, someone jumped the gun.""
McCarthy also told PolitiFact the ad was a mistake.",0,Eco News 
"The United States is ""seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s."" At the Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Barack Obama made a case that working families need more help because they're facing harder economic times.
""We're seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s,"" Obama said.
Obama is making a broad point here, but several sources support him.
The U.S. Census compiles data on income distribution on a year-to-year basis. Since 1967, it's clear that the top 5 percent of all households are capturing a growing share of the nation's aggregate income.
From 1917 to 1998, the income share of the top 10 percent dropped and then began rising again, following a  U-shaped curve, according to a historical analysis of U.S. tax returns by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez published in 2003 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics .
Piketty and Saez found that economic inequality grew  further by 2005. That year, the top 1 percent of Americans — people with incomes of more than $348,000 — received their largest share of national income since 1928.
Critics may argue whether this change in income distribution is significant or not, or what it's underlying causes are. Earlier in this campaign, Hillary Clinton argued that George W. Bush was to blame, a statement we found only Half-True .",1,Barack Obama
"Contends that President Obama ""literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'"" With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.
Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.
Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.
""I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,'"" said Pence. He added that Democrat ""John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'""
It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.
""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""
While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.
""The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said.
So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.
What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already looked into the issue and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.
Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.
It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.
Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would ""necessarily skyrocket,"" and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True.",1,Mike Pence
"Says Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year. In the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney focused on the commitments that President Obama failed to deliver on. In that list, he included immigration reform. Romney reminded the audience of what Obama had promised.
""He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges,"" Romney said. ""Didn't even file it.""""
This is one of the promises we’ve tracked in the Obamameter, and Romney is correct.
During the 2008 campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""
In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""
But the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.
Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called a ""a very important step.""
Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.
Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills.",1,Mitt Romney

""This newly unveiled data shows we can confront over-incarceration at the same time that we continue to promote public safety,"" he said. ""Already, in fiscal year 2014, we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years.""
The federal prison population has swelled dramatically since the early 1980s, due in large part to the prosecution of drug-related crimes, so we thought we’d double-check Holder’s statistics.
In 1980 , the federal prison population was about 24,000. It had hovered around that number since the 1940s.
By December 2013 (which came within the federal government’s 2014 fiscal year), federal prisons held about 216,000 inmates, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . That was down by nearly 2,000 inmates from a peak of roughly 218,000 than the year before.
That’s a tiny decline -- less than 1 percent, after a nine-fold increase between 1980 and 2013 -- but it’s still the first time the federal prison population had dropped since 1980, the BJS reports.
The solid red line in this Bureau of Justice Statistics graph shows the trend:
The drop may eventually grow larger. When he first announced this decline back in September , Holder said internal projections showed a drop of 10,000 federal inmates by fiscal year 2016.
We’ll note a few minor quibbles. The decline is actually the first in 33 years not 32, as Holder said. And Holder refers fiscal years, but the best data we could get our hands on goes by calendar year. The reality is that the prison population fluctuates daily, so any figure used for the current period is going to vary a bit. So we won’t count these factors against Holder.
Perhaps more interesting than the drop itself is the reason why.
One possible factor is the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which sought to remove sentencing discrepancies between crack and powder cocaine-related crimes, and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for crack possession.
Experts said that a contributing factor to the projected future decline is the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s July 2014 decision to allow the possibility of retroactively reduced sentences for individuals incarcerated on drug charges. This potentially affects 50,000 federal inmates.
Let’s also put the decline into context.
In reality, the federal inmate decline isn’t putting a huge dent into the nation’s prison population. Federal prisoners made up just 12 percent of the nation’s prison population in 2013, according to the BJS report, with those in state prisons and local jails accounting for the other 88 percent.
Indeed, the federal decline was actually wiped out -- and then some -- by an increase of 5,000 inmates in the state prison population.
Still, the U.S. population as a whole grew faster than the inmate population, meaning that the country’s overall imprisonment rate declined in 2013.
""While the national prison population suggests a modest increase in the incarcerated population, the picture in some states is more drastic,"" said a report out of New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.
A report by the Prison Policy Initiative agreed, saying, ""We can’t end our nation’s experiment with mass incarceration without grappling with the wide variety of state-level criminal justice policies, practices and trends.""
Finally, we’ll note that, despite the decline, federal prisons remain overcrowded. Medium- and high-security facilities are operating at 40 percent and 50 percent above capacity, respectively, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",1,Eric Holder
"The federal tax code includes ""deductions for birds flying across America."" There were a number of head-scratching exchanges in President Donald Trump’s interview with The Economist posted on May 11 , including Trump’s claim -- easily debunked -- that he had coined the phrase ""prime the pump.""
But one line that raised our eyebrows was about tax deductions for birds.
""I get more deductions,"" Trump said. ""I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions. They have deductions for birds flying across America. They have deductions for everything.""
At first, we were mystified at what Trump was talking about. But as it turns out, he’s on target -- and as a golf course owner, he has reason to know about this obscure part of the federal tax code.
We’ll walk you through it.
The tax deductions in question involve what are known as ""conservation easements.""
A conservation easement for a parcel of land is an agreement by which the landowner pledges to forgo future development. This way, the land remains in its natural state and, among other things, can provide habitat for animals, including migratory birds.
In typical easements, the landowner continues to own the land itself, but the right to develop it is donated to a nonprofit organization that promises not to build on it. The difference between the pre-donation value of the land and the post-donation value of the land can be deducted on the landowner’s tax returns as a gift, said Steven Barshov, a land-use and environmental-law attorney at the firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, P.C. The exact loss in land value is determined by an appraiser.
For large or expensive parcels of land, the tax break can be substantial -- it can eliminate up to half of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (or all of it, if they are a farmer or a rancher). And if the amount of the gift is greater than one year’s adjusted gross income, the balance can be carried over through up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted.
Compared to popular tax deductions like those for the interest on home mortgages, deductions for conservation easements are relatively small. Still, they add up: Bloomberg reported that in 2010, almost 3,000 taxpayers used conservation easements to deduct $766 million from their tax returns, according to IRS data . As recently as 2007, that amount was as high as $2.2 billion.
Where they have come in for criticism is for disproportionately benefiting the ultra-rich. Indeed, for a time, the administration of President Barack Obama tried to get rid of the tax break.
""They’re overwhelmingly for high-end individuals and provide little to no benefit to the public,"" Dean Zerbe, who examined easement donations as a Republican aide on the Senate Finance Committee, told Bloomberg . ""I don’t know if I could design a tax break that’s more targeted toward the millionaire set.""
This may explain why this particular tax deduction popped into Trump’s head during the Economist interview.
Forbes noted that when Trump gave the Associated Press a 94-page list of $102 million in charitable donations he had made since 2010, one of the entries was $63.825 million for ""various conservation easements.""
The White House did not respond to a request for information about easements, but according to Forbes, Trump has donated easements for land on the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Beyond the golf-course easements, Trump has also donated easements for his personal estate in Westchester County, N.Y., as well as his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Forbes reported.
Easements for golf courses have been particularly controversial, but they have been upheld in the courts, albeit with some restrictions. In one case, the U.S. Tax Court denied a deduction for an easement because the golf course used chemicals that rendered the land unsuitable for wildlife habitat.
But in a 2009 case, the Kiva Dunes golf course in Alabama won its case to claim the deduction after demonstrating that it was used by 46 species of neotropical birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The court’s only quibble was the valuation; the donation’s value was reduced from $30.6 million to $28.7 million.
""Protection of significant wildlife habitat is a conservation purpose qualifying a conservation easement for a charitable deduction,"" David Wooldridge, the Alabama attorney who represented the golf course, told PolitiFact.
There’s at least one other provision of the tax code where migratory bird habitat could qualify a landowner for tax deductions.
""In general, farm landowners and tenants can deduct expenses related to soil or water conservation, farmland erosion prevention, or endangered species recovery from their federal taxes, where otherwise these would be considered capital expenses,"" according to a guide for land conservation published by Texas A&M University.
To qualify for this deduction requires a nearby endangered species and a conservation plan approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
For the record, neither tax benefit applies only or specifically to birds.",1,Donald Trump
"Say Lance Armstrong is dead. A newsy-looking four-paragraph web post says Lance Armstrong has died.
Don’t buy it. The post is fake and Armstrong is alive, he’s already indicated.
""Ha, ha,"" Armstrong texted in response to an Austin American-Statesman reporter today. ""Yeah, weird.""
The fake story claims Armstrong has died of stage 4 colon cancer. The news allegedly was announced on Facebook by Armstrong’s daughter, Anna.
Armstrong, though, took to social media to debunk the post. As noted by news organizations including the American-Statesman, a May 12, 2017, video post on the one-time world-class bicyclist’s Instagram account shows Armstrong seated behind a car steering wheel and showing, on a phone, the announcement of his death by the fox-news24.com website , and then smiling and shaking his head back and forth, meaning ""naw.""
Before noon the same day, Armstrong tweeted out a web link to the video with this message: ""The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.""
As our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington noted in April 2017, the fox-news24.com site attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network.
The fox-news24.com story's citation of Anna helps raise a red flag. Armstrong has no children who go by that name, at least according to a December 2016 Daily Mail news story about an Armstrong family Christmas card.
Just before we completed this fact check, an Armstrong representative, Mark Higgins, answered our inquiry by email: ""I can confirm that he is indeed alive.""",0,Bloggers
"During the recession, ""the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent."" During the Aug. 1, 2010, roundtable on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked panelists about the current levels of slow growth in the United States economy.
""Growth is happening,"" Amanpour said, ""but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.""
She turned to George Will, the conservative columnist, who had been shaking his head. ""Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it,"" Will said. ""It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. ... Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. ... It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.""
We thought it would be worthwhile to check whether the savings rate has in fact risen to 6.2 percent during the recession.
Checking the number itself was easy. We looked to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the personal saving rate, which it defines as the percentage of personal disposable income that is saved. The data shows that during the second quarter of 2010, the personal saving rate was about 6.2 percent, just as Will had said.
Will is also right to suggest that the rate has risen. The current rate is the second highest it has been in any quarter since at least 2004, which is the earliest data BEA offers on the chart we found. Prior to the start of the recession in 2008, the saving rate was typically below 4 percent, and much of the time it was below 2 percent. In other words, consumers today are hoarding significantly more of their income than they were during the go-go days of high real estate values, easy credit and a steadily growing economy.
So Will is right on the facts. But we were also intrigued about whether the higher savings rate has hampered the nation's economic recovery, as he suggests.
Let's begin by explaining the ""paradox of thrift"" that Will cited. The major tenet is that when people save a lot of money, rather than spend it, they help their own bottom lines -- but that if everyone follows that approach, then everybody loses. According to the theory, the money saved doesn't get injected into the economy, where it would boost production and profits and help create jobs. In other words, a higher personal savings rate, like the one Will is talking about, can actually hurt the economy even as it helps individuals live within their means and hedge against personal economic setbacks.
We checked with a cross-section of economists to see whether they thought this theory -- which was popularized by  left-of-center economist John Maynard Keynes -- is generally considered accurate today. The experts we talked to said that it has broad, but not universal, approval.
Most of the skepticism about the paradox of thrift has come from the right. Conservative economist Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute said that free-market economics doesn't dispute that higher saving leads to lower consumption, but it places less importance on that shift. Free-marketers say that as long as the national income is growing, then the displacement of consumption by savings doesn't matter that much.
J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that when Keynes popularized the concept in the early 20th century, the money that was ""saved"" was actually stuck in the proverbial mattress, at which point it really did leave the economic system. By contrast, there are many relatively safe options for parking one's money today, even accounting for the shakiness in the financial sector since 2008. And if a higher savings rate means that people are putting their money into banks or other safe investments, that money makes its way back into the economy as capital available to lend. In turn, greater availability of loans can help juice the economy.
That said, there are still many defenders of the original Keynesian view of the paradox of thrift. They cite real-world evidence from the past few years, in which investment has fallen compared to pre-recession levels despite historically low interest rates.
""Businesses and households evidently do not want to invest as much in 2010 as they did in 2007"" because they're not confident those investments will pay off, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""Of course, one reason for their lack of confidence is the very slow growth in household consumption, which is a byproduct of the rise in household saving rates. On the surface, then, the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift. The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth, at least in the short run.""
We'll acknowledge that there's a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rate's growth during the recession. But on Will's core factual assertion -- that the savings rate has climbed during the recession -- he's correct.",1,George Will
"""Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’"" A fake news site has taken creative license by saying that a man President Donald Trump is reportedly picking to lead a top science job actually mocked scientists, calling them ""dumb regular people that think dinosaurs existed.""
A May 20 post by USPOLN.com headlined ""Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’,"" takes aim at Sam Clovis.
News reports have said that Trump plans to nominate Clovis as undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research, Education and Economics division, a position that’s been held by scientists in past administrations. Clovis is the Department of Agriculture’s senior White House adviser , but reportedly lacks a science background. He has a doctorate in public administration, has taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College in Iowa, hosted a conservative radio show and was a Trump campaign policy adviser.
Has he disparaged scientists as USPOLN.com said? Facebook users flagged the post as potential fake news. We found that quotes attributed to Clovis are indeed fake.
USPOLN.com calls itself a "" hybrid News/Satire platform ,"" and we’ve included it in our list of websites that deliberately post false or fake stories.
A disclaimer in its ""About Us"" page plainly tells readers its intentions and accuracy:
""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""
The USPOLN.com story about Clovis heavily borrows, almost verbatim, multiple paragraphs from a May 12 report from ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit, investigative journalism website.
USPOLN.com’s opening sentences:
""The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the ‘chief scientist’ is supposed to be the leader ‘among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.’ President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.""
ProPublica’ first few sentences:
""The USDA’s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition. Under the 2008 Farm Bill, its leader is supposed to serve as the agency’s ‘chief scientist’ and be chosen ""from among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.
""But Sam Clovis — who, according to sources with knowledge of the appointment and members of the agriculture trade press, is President Trump’s pick to oversee the section — appears to have no such credentials.
""Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and is openly skeptical of climate change. While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work.""
USPOLN.com’s post takes a satirical turn when it starts ""quoting"" Clovis on his comments about his credentials in an assumed interview with ""KYXL Radio"" (searches on the Federal Communications Commission website for a radio station with those call letters yielded zero results ).
The satirical website said Clovis ""argued that he was ‘proud’ he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because ‘scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead (sic) individuals anyway’.""
The post also falsely claims Clovis said he thanks God he did not make him a scientist and that he’s proud not to be one ""because they believe in things like evolution and the like.""
USPOLN.com links as its ""source"" another ""hybrid News/Satire"" site that has the same article posted.
We asked the USDA to confirm if Clovis was Trump’s pick for the chief scientist job. The department said it could not comment in advance on any nominations for Senate-confirmed positions.

"""After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three."" At several points in his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama noted the importance of manufacturing to the nation’s economy.
""Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing,"" Obama said. ""After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.""
The claim about job numbers is an update of a line Obama included in his acceptance speech at the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. We checked that one and rated it True .
The main difference between Obama’s two versions was that the timeline in the most recent claim has been extended by six months.
Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs.
Shedding jobs for more than 10 years
It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce.
Between March and April 1998 and December 2009 -- the decade-plus that Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.6 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had been ""shedding jobs for more than 10 years"" by the time he took office.
Added about 500,000 jobs over the past three years
During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to January 2013 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 490,000. We think that qualifies as ""about 500,000,"" as Obama put it.
It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the ""decade of decline."" The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline.",1,Barack Obama
"Says American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""an 80 percent approval rating."" Russian President Vladimir Putin recently called Donald Trump ""brilliant"" and ""talented,"" and Trump wears those compliments as a badge of honor .
On NBC’s Meet the Press on Dec. 20, host Chuck Todd asked the real estate mogul and Republican presidential front runner why he is so comfortable praising Putin, noting that Trump has called Putin a ""strong leader.""
""He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he’s a weak leader?"" Trump responded. ""He’s making mincemeat out of our president.""
Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a person’s success: the polls.
""He’s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. Okay?"" Trump said.  ""So it’s not even done by his pollsters. He’s very popular within Russia; that may change.""
An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high. For comparison, President Barack Obama’s job approval rating is currently about 46 percent and peaked at 64 percent in February 2009, his second month in office, according to Pew Research Center .
So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people.
In a first for Trump on the Truth-O-Meter thus far, he is.
By the numbers
A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump’s point , finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin.
""What Trump said is consistent with what we found,"" said Scott Gehlbach , a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings, the study asked whether Putin’s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of ""social desirability bias,"" the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms.
To correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president.
After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, Gehlbach and his co-authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate.
Gehlbach noted, though, that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it’s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media.
""It’s reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news,"" Gehlbach said.
This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia, wrote Joshua Tucker, a political science professor at New York University, in a Nov. 24 post on the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog.
In sum, ""the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come,"" Tucker wrote.
One potential wrinkle in Trump’s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn’t dilute Trump’s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government.
Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center.
This past summer, Pew found 88 percent of Russians ""have confidence in (Putin), to do the right thing regarding world affairs."" Putin’s standing is substantially lower among Americans, with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him.
Gehlbach’s article, which will be published in the journal Post-Soviet Affairs, also mentions how Putin’s high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers’ polls. The study cites an Associated Press-NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putin’s approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014.",1,Donald Trump
"Says ""our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years."" President Barack Obama aimed to refocus the national debate and put the economy front and center with a speech at Knox College in Illinois. It was the same place he spoke as a senator in 2005 about the need for the government to help the middle class. He stuck to that theme in this speech, but now as president, he summarized the improvements that have come on his watch.
He talked about millions of new jobs, burgeoning energy production, and the nation’s improving balance sheet. ""Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years,"" Obama told the crowd.
In light of Obama’s ongoing battle with Republicans over taxes and spending, we thought this would be an interesting claim to examine. In this factcheck, we look at whether we are really seeing one of the most rapid declines in the deficit in many decades.
As a reminder, the deficit is a snapshot of one year’s fiscal outlook. It’s the shortfall between what the government spends and what the government collects in taxes and other revenues.
The White House press office told us that the proof is in the numbers. They tracked the deficit as a percent of the entire economy, measured as the Gross Domestic Product.
In 2009, the first year of Obama’s presidency, after tax cuts and new spending, the deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP. In 2012, the deficit declined to 7 percent of GDP. So that’s a decline of 3.1 percentage points.
You have to go back 63 years to the period between 1946 and 1949 to find a bigger four-year drop than what the country saw between 2009 and 2012. Right after World War II ended, the U.S. deficit stood at 7.2 percent of GDP. By 1949, America had a surplus of 0.2 percent. So that’s a decline of 7.4 percentage points.
We downloaded data from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the deficit as a percent of GDP all the way back to 1930. When we ran the numbers, we found, as Obama said, you need to go back to 1946 to find a larger change.
The numbers game
As with any statistics, you have to be careful, and to help us be careful, we contacted five economists and policy analysts. The White House simply did a little subtraction to measure the difference between the numbers at the start and the end of the four years.
There is another option, which is to look at the relative size of the decline. So if the deficit went from 10.1 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP, that means the deficit dropped 30 percent.  But when we did this going back to World War II, we saw some very strange results. Big deficit declines could look smaller in relative terms than small declines.
Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that seeks to reduce deficits faster than the president has done, confirmed that point. Peuquet said the administration has the right approach, because relative numbers can make very different changes look the same.
Peuquet gave the example of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the first year and 0.5 percent after four years.
""That would look like a 50 percent improvement in the level,"" Peuquet said. ""However, a change in deficits that went from 10 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP would also register as a 50 percent improvement – despite being a much larger change in relation to the economy.""
Peuquet and others raised a second statistical issue -- choosing the endpoints for the comparison. It’s a common device to pick the range that best proves your point.
But in the case of deficit reduction, no one quibbled with the idea that longer periods are more revealing, and Obama used all the years he has available. His first year in office was 2009 and the numbers for 2013 are not yet in.
To the extent that a majority view emerged, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley probably expressed it best.
""There is no single ‘correct’ way of doing the analysis,"" Auerbach said, ""but I would say that their approach is a reasonable one.""
One reason Obama is able to point to an historically high decline is because the deficit as a percent of GDP had never been higher.  Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group focused on taxes and spending, said the reduction is significant. But at the same time, he said, ""Let’s face it, there was a lot to reduce. The deficit was morbidly obese.""
Similarly, the economy took a major hit which gave it more room for improvement in historic terms. So even a moderate recovery has eased the deficit by both increasing tax receipts and reducing demand for government aid such as unemployment support.
Lastly, while the deficit might decline, the country’s accumulated debt is projected to grow.
""The future path is not captured in snapshots of what happened over the past few years, Peuquet said. ""It ignores the unsustainable debt trajectory the country still faces.""",1,Barack Obama
"""Ninety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales."" Democrats made a forceful argument for stricter gun control on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
One speaker, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, called for expanded background checks in particular.
""Listen, 90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands,"" Murphy said.
Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.
National polls conducted over the past year consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.
Here are a few examples of recent polls about background checks:
Quinnipiac University poll , conducted June 21-27, 2016:  ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Not sure: 1 percent.
CNN/ORC poll, conducted June 16-19, 2016 : Would you favor or oppose ""a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony""? Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 8 percent.

Public Policy Polling survey, conducted March 24-26, 2016 : ""Do you support or oppose requiring a criminal background check of every person who wants to buy a firearm?"" Support: 84 percent. Oppose: 10 percent. Not sure: 6 percent.

Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11, 2015 : ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.
Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21, 2015 : ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent.
Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20, 2015 : Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?"" Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/refused: 2 percent.
Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.
""At the collective level, we know that Americans are in favor of the government instituting new checks on the ability to buy guns, which theoretically would prevent those who have some type of official negative record on file from buying them,"" wrote Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport in June . ""Americans have mixed feelings as to how effective they think these background check laws would be but overwhelmingly are willing to go along with them.""
Some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.
For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll .
This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.
The October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.
""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in a prior interview with PolitiFact.",1,Chris Murphy
"""Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country."" Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine touted his language skills in Phoenix by delivering a speech in Spanish, saying his ticket would focus on immigration reform and an economy that works for all.
Kaine spoke to a crowd in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood about the United States’ immigrant fabric, comprised over centuries with people from all parts of the world.
""And people sometimes forget – and some may not even know – that the Hispanic community has been part of our country since the Spanish arrived in St. Augustine in 1565. That was well before the British landed in North America,"" Kaine said Nov. 3. ""Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country.""
We decided to follow Kaine on his history tour and wondered if he was right about the Spanish language’s roots in the United States.
The United States does not have an official national language, yet 31 states have laws establishing English as their official tongue, according to the CIA World Factbook.
English is the dominant language across the states and Spanish the second-most common. Of about 291.5 million people, 5 years and older, an estimated 37.6 million speak Spanish at home, according to 2011 Census Bureau data (the latest we could find). Chinese follows, spoken by more than 2.8 million people.
And while there is no definitive data, the Census Bureau estimates there are more than 300 languages spoken in the United States.
Se habla español
Linguist experts we interviewed all agreed with Kaine, saying he was right about Spanish being the first European language spoken in the United States.
It all ties back to Florida.
In many textbooks that deal with the history of the Spanish language, there are statements similar to Kaine’s, said Sonia Ramírez Wohlmuth, a senior instructor of world languages at the University of South Florida.
She referred us to page 211 of a textbook on language and linguistic diversity in the United States that says:
""Of the European explorers who reached North America during the Age of Discovery, the Spanish arrived first. ... Exploration of the Southeast began in 1513, when the first governor of Puerto Rico, Ponce de León, arrived on the coast of Florida during his quest for the fountain of youth. This marked the first recorded presence of the Spanish on what would eventually be U.S. soil.""
In the late 1520s, an expedition led by Spanish conquistador Pánfilo de Narváez landed near present-day Tampa Bay.
But it was a failure, because almost everyone was killed or died before they could report back, said Richard A. Rhodes, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley.
Then there’s St. Augustine .
Founded in 1565, St. Augustine is regarded as the United States’ oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin. It was founded by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , a conquistador from Spain.
""Spanish was the first language spoken by conquistadors and settlers who founded St. Augustine (San Agustín in Spanish, after the saint),"" said Evelina Guzauskyte, an associate professor of Spanish at Wellesley College.
The British and the French did not arrive until later, and the Portuguese were occupying other lands, Guzauskyte said.
The Observatory of the Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultures in the United States at Harvard University also told us about an explorer (born in what’s now Mexico to parents from Spain) who left an inscription in New Mexico in 1605, that says in Spanish: "" pasó por aquí el adelantado Juan de Oñate. ""
Archeology Southwest translates the full inscription to: ""There passed this way the Adelantado (conqueror) Don Juan de Oñate from the discovering of the South Sea on the 16th of April 1605.""
The first permanent English settlement in North America was in 1607 at Jamestown, Va. The Pilgrims arrived until 1620 in present-day Massachusetts.
Clinton’s campaign highlighted a PBS post about the history of Spanish in the United States.
""Spanish actually antedates English in the areas that now make up the composite United States — a fact that surprises many Americans,"" says part of the post. ""In terms of continuity and longevity in the United States, the Spanish language is second only to Native American languages that were spoken for centuries prior to colonization.""",1,Tim Kaine
"Israel's per capita income ""is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world."" House Republicans have released a plan to cut the budget, but Rand Paul says they need to cut even more.
House GOP leaders proposed cuts of $58 billion per year. Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky and a tea party favorite, has a plan that cuts $500 billion.
Paul's plan includes cutting all foreign aid, including about $3 billion in annual aid to Israel. Cutting aid to Israel has got some of his fellow conservatives unhappy, but Paul isn't backing down.
""I'm not singling out Israel. I'm a supporter of Israel,"" Paul said. ""I want to be known as a friend of Israel, but you can't give money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries, even if they are our friends.""
Paul added that, ""They're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don't think so.""
Paul added that Israel has defense capabilities already that are ahead of the country's potential enemies.
Paul's phrasing suggested some uncertainty about Israel's wealth, so we decided to check it out.
We discovered that there are several ways to calculate per capita income by country. The two major indicators we consulted showed that Israel was safely in the top 25 percent.
The World Bank calculates per capita income two ways. One accounts for purchasing power and one doesn't. Purchasing power means that the measurement takes into account how goods are priced in a particular country. The World Bank statistics covered about 160 countries and territories.
If you consider purchasing power, in 2009 Israel was No. 25 on the list of countries, with per capita income of $27,110. No. 1 was Luxembourg with $59,550. The United States was No. 5 with $45,640.
If you don't consider purchasing power, Israel is No. 23, at $25,790. On this measure, Norway is No. 1 at $84,640, and the United States is No. 8 at $46,360.
Either way, Israel makes the top 40, which puts it in the top 25 percent of the World Bank listings.
Seeking the broadest possible measure, though, we looked for a more widespread account of how many countries there are in the world. The United Nations, for example, says it has 192 members. Other sources note that the independence of some countries is contested, so the number can shift depending on world events to anywhere between 191 and 196 countries. So even by the larger number of countries, Israel would still be in the top 25 percent.",1,Rand Paul
"A government shutdown ""could disrupt ... veterans' benefits."" With a possible government shutdown looming, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., is backing legislation that would make sure the paychecks for members of Congress stop along with everything else. Although similar measures have been proposed, so far congressional paychecks are still intact.
We addressed this proposal more generally in a separate item . But for this item, we were more interested in checking one of the arguments Stabenow made as she argued for the bill’s passage.
""Lawmakers need to be held accountable and should feel the impact of a government shutdown just like many other Americans will,"" Stabenow said in a March 1, 2011, news release . ""A shutdown could disrupt Social Security checks, veterans' benefits, hold up exports and cost private sector jobs and will stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands of people. It's only fair that members of Congress' paychecks be stopped too.""
You can read our analysis of whether a shutdown would endanger Social Security checks in our rating of a statement by President Barack Obama here . In this item, we’ll look what could happen to veterans’ benefits.
First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act , which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.""
The biggest risk for veterans benefit checks comes from the fact that employees of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are paid through appropriated funds. So a shutdown could prevent those employees -- just like employees of the Social Security Administration -- from going to work.
How many VA employees would be considered ""essential"" -- and thus would stay on the job during a shutdown -- and how many would not remains to be seen. Many VA employees are doctors and nurses at VA hospitals and are unlikely to be furloughed. This situation for benefits employees is not yet clear.
As a practical matter, the department has a bit of a cushion. Veterans’ benefit checks go out at the beginning of every month, so if a shutdown starts April 8 -- as would happen if lawmakers cannot agree on a deal -- there wouldn’t be widespread problems for existing beneficiaries for a few weeks. However, if a new month dawned with the government still on hiatus, a new round of checks could indeed be delayed, depending on which employees are deemed ""essential.""
""If it goes beyond the first of the next month, you may see disruptions there,"" said David Autry, a spokesman for Disabled American Veterans. Checks for veterans from the Defense Department would be subject to the same types of uncertainties as those sent by the VA.
In the meantime, two other benefits-related activities could be curtailed by a shutdown, depending on staff availability. Answers to routine inquiries from veterans could be slowed or stopped entirely. And there might be no employees to handle new claims for benefits.
During the last government shutdown in 1995, ""more than 400,000 veterans saw their disability benefits and pension claims delayed,"" Senate Veterans Affairs Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said, according to the Army Times. ""Money that they were counting on didn’t come to them. Payment of GI Bill education checks were delayed for hundreds of thousands of our veterans. Telephone calls from our veterans to veterans’ benefits offices went unanswered. Mail from veterans to our VA offices wasn’t opened. It wasn’t answered.""
So where does this leave us? By saying that a government shutdown ""could disrupt ... veterans' benefits,"" Stabenow phrased her statement cautiously, and, for the most part, accurately. A shutdown is not destined to disrupt checks to veterans, but it could -- either for new claims, or, if the shutdown drags on long enough, for existing beneficiaries.
Stabenow could have added that a shorter shutdown in line with the duration of those in 1995, or a generous allocation of ""essential"" employees, could minimize or even eliminate the impact on veterans checks this year. But we think that’s a minor omission, given how carefully she couched her statement.",1,Debbie Stabenow
"The Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent. In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama said his administration has focused on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes.
""Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law,"" Obama said in the speech on May 10, 2011. ""And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy.
""But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent.""
Obama's claim that under his administration, deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy, so we decided to check it out.
According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants ""removed""  rose about 6 percent  -- from 369,221 to 392,862  -- between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 percent were criminals; but by 2010, the percentage jumped to 50 percent.
The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114,415 in 2008 to 195,772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So that squares with Obama's claim.
Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year (which began at the end of September) suggests that trend is continuing, with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals.
In an Oct. 6, 2010, press release , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administration's ""prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety.""
""Our approach has yielded historic results, removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration,"" Napolitano said.
Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, said it's true that the deportation rate, particularly deportation of convicted criminals, has been higher under Obama.
""My sense is that Obama deserves credit, for all the complaints about him, that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations,"" Beck said. ""I think the main context, though, is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small.""
And even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about fewer than 400,000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.
DHS statistics show that under Bush, overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008 -- going from 116,782 to 369,221. But in the latter part of Bush's presidency, the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of Bush's presidency, deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71,079 in 2001 to 114,415 in 2008. That's a 61 percent increase over eight years.
In the first two years under Obama, the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals. And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase.",1,Barack Obama
"""Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President."" A widely shared post from a little-known website suggests that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election could lead the courts to install Hillary Clinton as president.
""Breaking: Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President,"" says a Dec. 11, 2016, post on USA Snich, a website so obscure that Googling ""USA Snich"" only brings up references to the Harry Potter game of quidditch (though it uses a ""snitch"") or articles about prison snitching.
Yet the post got enough interest by social media users that it popped up in the list of questionable articles Facebook is sharing with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers . (The USA Snich post is actually a nearly verbatim reprint of one from the site SupremePatriot.com .)
One reason for the wide sharing may be that the post hit a social media sweet spot: What it advertises would simultaneously outrage conservatives and give liberals hope. As it happens, the USA Snich post frames it in a way favorable to conservatives, calling the notion advanced in the headline ""scary"" and concluding, ""What a bunch of BS. This will never happen! #NEVERHILLARY."" However, posts with a similar message as this headline also appeared on liberal sites, such as Occupy Democrats .
So what’s going on with the USA Snich post? Let’s take a closer look.
A legal precedent?
The post links to an article published on the Huffington Post. It was written by a contributor -- not a Huffington Post staff member -- named Alex Mohajer, who is identified as ""political director of Bros4Hillary, a volunteer advocacy organization"" and the holder of a law degree.
In the column, Mohajer writes that recent allegations of Russian-linked hacking could provide a basis for the federal courts to get involved with the election’s outcome, through a case that’s little known even among constitutional scholars.
""At least one federal court decision suggests there may be some federal case law on the question of whether it is possible to invalidate the outcome of an election after the fact when there is fraud, and replace a candidate benefitted by fraud with his opponent,"" he wrote. ""The case, Marks v. Stinson, is the first and only known case in which a federal judge reversed an election outcome.""
The 1995 case revolved around allegations that Democrat William G. Stinson colluded with election officials to cast illegally obtained absentee ballots. In February 1994, after Stinson had taken office, the federal judge ordered him removed and replaced by his opponent, Republican Bruce Marks. An appellate court affirmed the district court’s intervention in the matter, but it objected to the court seating Marks, although because Marks was already serving, the court allowed him to continue for the remainder of the term.
Here’s the money paragraph:
The case offers an ""interesting rationale that could theoretically be applied in part if, after Donald Trump assumes office, it is shown that Russian hacking (or any fraud, for that matter) robbed Hillary Clinton of the presidency,"" Mohajer writes. ""The case offers clues that imply courts may intervene.""
This is a novel legal theory. We asked Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, what he thought of it.
""I'm pretty confident that there's zero chance of it happening,"" Roosevelt said. ""I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, ‘Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.’ But that's not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there's no judicial remedy for that.""
The USA Snich post
In other words, the theory offered in the headline is, at most, the longest of longshots. So right off the bat, the headline elevates the urgency of a legal theory of uncertain value that had been advanced by one Clinton supporter.
The USA Snich post (and the SupremePatriot post) also leave out a lot of cautionary words that Mohajer himself had inserted in his original column.
While USA Snich did link to the Huffington Post column and reposted several paragraphs of what Mohajer wrote, none of the paragraphs reprinted actually addresses the legal theory underpinning the headline’s claim that the courts could overturn the election. To find that, a reader would have to click the Huffington Post link, something many readers presumably won’t make the effort to do.
Mohajer’s column acknowledges some significant questions about the theory. ""Obviously both the stakes and the office in question are much higher than in Marks v. Stinson,"" he wrote. ""There has been no case of first impression with regards to the presidency being overturned to a wrongful winner’s opponent. There is also, of course, no constitutional Electoral College process or system in Pennsylvania, so the situations are not exactly analogous. … It is not clear how the case would impact a presidential election.""
When we reached out to Mohajer, he said that being a law school graduate, he thought of the piece as ""an academic exercise.""
""I thought it was an interesting case on election fraud and the only federal court ruling I could find that had a judge replacing an elected official with their opponent from the election because of fraud,"" Mohajer told PolitiFact. ""It would require courts use a liberal interpretation of the word ‘fraud’ and would probably require some wrongdoing by Trump.""
In the interview, Mohajer acknowledged that the likelihood of this scenario occurring is ""next to lightning striking the same person twice.""
""Ultimately, is it plausible? Of course not,"" he said. ""But If you had asked me 12 months ago whether I thought Donald Trump would elected president, I would have answered in kind with the exact same certainty.""",0,USA Snich
"Says a Washington Post reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of ""faking."" A website seeking to discredit sexual assault allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is digging up the alleged criminal record of a Washington Post reporter who helped break the story .
""WaPo reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of ‘faking,’ "" read the headline on 100percentfedup.com.
The headline on the story might make you think the reporter, Stephanie McCrummen, has a past of ""faking"" her news stories. But the details in the post aren’t related to journalism: They highlight McCrummen’s ""public criminal records in multiple states stretching across four time zones,"" including writing a ""fake check.""
""When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn’t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40-year-old sexual allegation against one of the most-hated, Steve Bannon-backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?"" the blogpost reads.
The story was shared over 24,000 times and cited a 2011 Red State blog post that similarly sought to discredit McCrummen following a report that was critical of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry .
Again, none of the charges speak to McCrummen’s journalistic integrity. The only criminal violation and ""faking"" related to a bounced check written 25 years ago when McCrummen was in college, while the rest of her ""history"" encompassed traffic infractions.
McCrummen was an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1992 when she wrote a $6.93 check that bounced.
""That was a bounced check was for groceries while Stephanie was in college, which she paid back,"" said Kristine Coratti, vice president of communications at the Washington Post, in response to our email inquiry to McCrummen.
McCrummen pleaded guilty to the criminal misdemeanor charge, appeared before a magistrate and paid it off, alongside a $50 fee, according to James Stanford, the Orange County Superior Court clerk.
Traffic violations
The blogpost then pivots to McCrummen’s traffic offenses, the first of which was for speeding in Scottsdale, Ariz.
""In 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges,"" the post reads. ""After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.""
Traffic offenses can be criminal if the driver is found driving without a license or the excessive speed was not prudent for the conditions. But the court authorities doubt this was the case.
""If it was criminal it would probably still be in the records because those are retained longer than civil traffic case, but we just can’t know for sure,"" said Jennifer Ilten, executive secretary at the Scottsdale city court.
Heather Murphy, communications director at the Arizona Supreme Court, said the court where the fine was paid wasn’t a ""criminal court,"" but rather, municipal.
Murphy confirmed that McCrummen owed -- and paid -- $321.30, according to court records.
""The fine is fairly typical of a civil traffic violation for speeding or another moving violation, but I cannot state that as fact,"" Murphy said. ""This is not driving without a license or DUI – those fines begin in excess of $1,000.
""Even knowing the fare amount, a big chunk of that could have been the collection fees,"" Ilten said. ""It was probably a lesser charge.""
Murphy also explained that FARE enforcement is much less sinister than the post made it sound. It usually occurs when a person doesn’t receive a citation because it went to an old address. A new citation is mailed to the new address when discovered. In this case, the ticket was entered for collection on Oct. 4, 2010, and paid in full on Oct. 23, 2010.
The other two traffic tickets both occurred in Virginia and had been wiped from the courts. In Fairfax County, the post reported McCrummen failed to obey a highway sign -- an infraction, not a criminal offense. The same goes for Prince William County; the post said McCrummen drove at 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour speed zone. That’s also not a criminal offense.
Coratti declined to comment on McCrummen’s traffic infractions.",0,Bloggers
"A Colgate toothpaste is subject to ""recall."" A headline warns consumers about triclosan, an ingredient in some consumer products: ""If you are using this toothpaste .... throw it away immediately!""
Facebook users flagged the Nov. 28 story on Shared This as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The article could leave readers with an inaccurate picture about actions the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took with respect to triclosan , but it also contains some factual information.
Shared This wrote that the FDA issued a warning ""this week"" that it will ban triclosan, a common antibacterial agent used in soaps, detergents, toys, cosmetics, and toothpaste.
""Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects. Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient,"" wrote Shared This.
The website included an image of the word ""recall"" and a photo of Colgate toothpaste showing that it contains triclosan. That could give readers the false impression that the FDA banned triclosan in toothpaste -- and that’s not the case.
Here’s what actually happened: Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the FDA to take action related to triclosan.
In September 2016 the FDA issued a new rule banning the use of triclosan in antibacterial soaps .
""That rule was specific to consumer hand washes,"" Sandy Walsh, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. told PolitiFact. That means the ban doesn’t apply to toothpaste.
Colgate Total Toothpaste was approved in 1997 as a toothpaste containing fluoride and triclosan, which was shown to be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis.
""Based on the scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk has been shown to be favorable for this product,"" Walsh said.
The New York Times reported in September 2016 that triclosan remained in toothpaste because Colgate Total convinced the FDA that the benefit of triclosan outweighed the risks. Colgate Total is the only toothpaste in the United States that contains triclosan.
A spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive, Thomas DiPiazza, told the New York Times that Colgate’s product had a far more rigorous safety review than other toothpastes.
When the company sought approval to use triclosan in 1997, it conducted a comprehensive evaluation of human safety. The original FDA submission for Colgate Total included more than 100 toxicology studies.
DiPiazza directed PolitiFact to a statement on Colgate’s website which cited a 2013 review of 30 studies by Cochrane Oral Health Group. The review concluded that there were benefits including reduction in plaque, gingivitis and bleeding gums in using a triclosan/copolymer fluoride toothpaste when compared with one without the ingredient.
""There was no evidence of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan/copolymer toothpastes in studies up to three years in length,"" Cochrane reported.
But a debate about triclosan has continued.
Several months after the FDA’s September 2016 rule was published, an article by 200 scientists and medical professionals published by Environmental Health Perspectives raised multiple concerns about triclosan.
The authors concluded that the ingredient has detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, overuse may contribute to antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance, and that potential implications for human reproduction and development merit further study.
The authors recommended that people avoid the use of triclosan except if there is an ""evidence based health benefit (e.g., physician-prescribed toothpaste for treating gum disease) and there is adequate evidence demonstrating they are safe.""
Colgate-Palmolive and the FDA however continue to stand by the use of triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste.
""It has been approved as safe and effective through the U.S. FDA rigorous New Drug Application process,"" DiPiazza said.

"""Our government right now. . . (is) spending 40 percent more than what we take in."" The U.S. government is living on credit, spending more than it receives and borrowing to keep up.
So Rep. Michele Bachmann says we need to tighten our belts.
""Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in,"" Bachmann said during a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.
The Congressional Budget Office has released preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. According to the CBO’s chart , the federal government had revenues of $2.3 trillion and expenditures of $3.6 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.3 trillion.
To calculate Bachmann’s figure of ""spending X percent more than what we take in"" -- the percent by which expenditures exceed revenues -- divide $3.6 trillion by $2.3 trillion. The answer: about 56 percent.
Two experts, one from the conservative Heritage Foundation and one from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, verified our math.
""If you say that spending is xx percent more than revenues, then the ratio is spending over revenues. So if you take in $2 and you spend $3, then you're spending 150 percent of revenues or you’re spending 50 percent more than you take in. That aligns with Bachman's language pretty closely,"" said JD Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Bachmann’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry, but we suspect she was slightly off because she misstated a figure that has been cited by others in recent months.
""We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend,"" Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said in January 2011 on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.
And Scott Rigell, a Republican who represents Virginia’s Second District, said in a February 2011 press release, ""We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend.""
Those cases refer to the proportions of spending funded by taxes versus borrowing, said Richard Kogan of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the CBO’s new numbers, the proportion is 36 percent -- pretty close to 40 cents on the dollar. But Bachmann's claim referred to revenues (""what we take in""), so 56 percent is the right number.",1,Michele Bachmann
"""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."" Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought.
""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money,"" was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story .
That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth .
Robinson’s Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn’t say what the article claims. Here’s what people sign:
For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate.""
The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives.
On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn’t speak to either of those conditions.
In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation.
Challenges to the petition
There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition.
First of all, the meaning of ""scientist"" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s of science degree. That’s no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition’s website says that 12,715 signers hold ""BS or equivalent academic degrees.""
When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, ""there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth.""
That would be about 12 percent of the total.
There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site’s figures, most of them don’t specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods.
These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as ""more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines.""
That’s way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians.
We also don’t know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, ""The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007.""
The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind’s role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn’t mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change.
There’s reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found ""six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer.""

"""New law (in California) makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day"" A new fury is circulating on social media over two water conservation laws signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown.
The legislation imposes new restrictions on water use as California recovers from a historic five-year drought that ended in April 2017. But several reports inaccurately stated that the laws would punish state residents who use too much water in their everyday routine.
""New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day,"" said a June 5, 2018, headline from the Federalist Papers Project, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Federalist Papers Project story references a similar post from conservative website Breitbart , but seems to have gathered most of its information from an article on The Organic Prepper , a blog devoted to ""preparedness, health, frugality and food,"" according to its about page. Several other websites reposted The Organic Prepper’s report or wrote similar articles.
Even U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., seemed to push the false narrative online. In a blog post , Nunes wrote, ""Californians don’t want to have to choose between doing their laundry and taking a shower, but that’s the kind of choice being forced on us.""
The false reports center on two bills — Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 — that Brown signed into law May 31, 2018.
Broadly speaking, the bills instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the Federalist Papers Project story said the bills would limit California residents to 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day, beginning in 2022. Violators who use more water than allowed, the story went, would be fined $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.
The story said this limit ""will turn the most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers"" by making it illegal to take a shower and run a load of laundry in a single day.
Here, the Federalist Papers Project borrowed calculations from The Organic Prepper’s story, which said the average shower and laundry load use 17 and 40 gallons of water, respectively, for a total of 57 daily gallons — two more gallons than would be allowed were California residents actually limited to 55 gallons of indoor water use per day.
But that is where the Federalist Papers Project got it wrong: Under the new legislation, Californians will not actually be penalized on an individual basis for excessive water use.
In reality, the bills stipulate that cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts must come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022. They will then need to meet their targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.
George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by three standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use — a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030. The other standards, both yet to be determined, will place similar caps on outdoor residential water use and water loss due to system leaks.
""Unfortunately some media outlets have grossly misinterpreted the law,"" Kostyrko said. ""These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal.""
Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668, explained that the legislation ""sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level, but it does not regulate what individual Californians or businesses can and can’t do.""
""There is nothing in this bill to target households or companies,"" Metropulos wrote in an email. ""Water use objectives are on territory-level of a water agency. There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry.""
This means that the Federalist Papers Project story was wrong to suggest that water use would be assessed on a daily individual basis. ""The new requirements are for water districts, not individuals,"" said Katie Hanzlik, press secretary for state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, who authored Senate Bill 606. ""And the number is based on average water use.""
Fines based on consumption will actually be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their targets, rather than individuals who use too much water on a given day. And while a water district could theoretically let those costs shift to individual water bills, any increase in costs assumed by ratepayers would be closer to a few bucks than $1,000.
For the record, it is also worth noting that washing machines are more efficient than they used to be, which calls into question some of the water-use estimates mentioned in the false reports.
Daisy Luther, author of The Organic Prepper, told us she got the figures for her story’s 57-gallon estimate from Home Water Works , a project from the nonprofit Alliance for Water Efficiency in collaboration with Chicago’s Field Museum. (The Federalist Papers Project did not respond to a request for comment.)
The Organic Prepper story reported that an average shower uses 17 gallons of water and an average load of laundry uses 40, and Luther said the 40-gallon figure was listed as the average for older washing machines. But most people now own high-efficiency laundry machines that use between 15 and 30 gallons per wash, according to Home Water Works . And since it is the average water use per capita that matters, one person’s reliance on an older machine would likely be offset by other residents who are not using so much water.",0,Bloggers
"""There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when (President Barack) Obama took office."" In the July 11, 2011, edition of the New York Times, Paul Krugman -- a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal columnist -- noted a statistic about recent trends in government employment.
He wrote , ""Everybody knows that President (Barack) Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn’t work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.""
Has government employment really gone down in the past two and a half years? We looked in the databases for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official tabulator of employment statistics.
We found that between January 2009 (when Obama took office) and June 2011 (the most recent month available), Krugman was right for overall government employment -- the combination of federal, state and local government workers. Overall government employment declined by 518,000 workers, or about 2.3 percent of the January 2009 level.
So his statistic is correct. But the closer you look at the data, the more varied the data becomes.
First, let’s look at federal government employment, which accounts for just 13 percent of all government employment. The number of federal workers has increased by 38,000 over the same period -- an increase of 1.4 percent.
And if you separate out the U.S. Postal Service, the growth was even bigger. Non-postal federal employment -- about 10 percent of all government employment -- increased over the same period by 139,000 workers, or 6.7 percent.
The decline in government employment clearly wasn’t driven by job losses at the federal level. It came from state and local government. So we’ll look at the trends for those categories here.
State employment accounts for 23 percent of the government workforce. State government payrolls declined by 113,000 over the same period, or 2.2 percent. Within this category, state education workers -- who account for a little under half of state workers -- actually rose slightly over the period. The hits were taken in the remainder of the state workforce -- a decline of 115,500, or 4.1 percent.
But the biggest declines in the government sector came in local government. Local government -- which accounts for 64 percent of all government employment -- fell by 443,000 workers, or 3 percent. That accounts for a huge portion of the half-million decrease in jobs that Krugman cited.
Education workers at the local level fared worse than those at the state level. Local education workers declined by 204,800, or 2.5 percent.
Non-education workers in local government fared even worse -- employment was down 238,400, or 3.7 percent.
The decline in government workers has certainly had an impact on the overall employment picture. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers, but government payrolls have declined by 493,000 -- cutting the number of jobs created almost in half.
So how does all this relate to Krugman’s comment? The fact that federal employment outside the Postal Service has risen by 6.7 percent in the past two and a half years is an important point to recognize for anyone studying employment trends. But Krugman was careful enough to avoid suggesting that federal employment declined by a half-million jobs. In fact, since a large chunk of the stimulus came in the form of aid to states -- specifically to help save jobs in education and other government sectors -- using total government employment figures as a yardstick seems reasonable to us.",1,Paul Krugman
"Says a Republican U.S. House member from Texas, Rob McCaskill, tweeted that he ""can’t wait for the next 9/11."" A newsy web post renounces a right-leaning U.S. House member from Texas for publicly wishing for another 9/11.
We’re sure, though, the congressman doesn’t exist and nor does the far West Texas district the character purported to represent on his, her or its recently shuttered Twitter account.
We launched into this fact check after a reader urged us to check into what seemed to be the non-existent Rep. Rob McCaskill of Texas. Next, our web search under that name led to a Feb. 11, 2017 post on liberalplug.com stating the very same Texas Republican had singled out the judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who left in place a U.S. district judge’s ruling blocking President Donald Trump from temporarily barring people from seven countries from entering the country.
The post initially says: ""GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy."" It later says that McCaskill tweeted: ""Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.""
Liberalplug.com’s post continues: ""Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.""
First things first: Texas’ 36 House members include no one named McCaskill.
Also, when we checked in mid-February 2017, no Rob McCaskill Twitter feed existed.
But a fresh search employing cachedview.com , which compiles web pages accumulated over time, led to what looked like the no-longer-in-business Twitter feed for ""Rep. Rob McCaskill"" of Pecos.
On that feed, a photo of a smiling balding fellow with a jacket over his shoulder says McCaskill is ""representing Texas’ 37th district beginning 2017!""
Note: Texas has no 37th district.
Our review of the limited number of tweets on the cached version of the account showed that whoever controls its posts put up about 25 tweets from Jan. 25, 2017 until 10:07 a.m. Feb. 10, 2017, nearly all of them explicitly supportive of Trump.
A sampling:
LiberalPlug.com’s McCaskill web post, critical of Trump, otherwise encourages readers to click through to another web site that says it centers on discussions of the U.S. and world from a leftist perspective.

"""We've had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789."" At a press briefing about the debt limit negotiations, Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., criticized a Republican push for a balanced budget amendment. He said Congress should not be hasty about amending the Constitution and noted that only a tiny number of amendments ultimately pass.
""We’ve had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. Twenty-seven amendments have been passed, 10 of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we’re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it’s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the 11,000 that were proposed,"" Rep. Becerra said, adding, ""That’s the height of ridicule.""
Becerra was later named to the ""super committee"" that is developing a plan to comply with the budget cuts required by the debt ceiling vote.
Before we get to the numbers, it’s worth reviewing the process for amending the U.S. Constitution.
Amendments can be proposed two ways: in Congress or by a national convention assembled at the request of the two-thirds of the states legislatures.
The national convention approach has been attempted twice but has never been successful. So the successful amendments have all originated in Congress.
And according to a congressional tally, Becerra is just about right on target: Congress has considered ""approximately 11,372 amendments"" from 1789 through December 31, 2008, the most recent tally available, according to the Statistics and Lists section of the United States Senate website.
Why is it ""approximately"" 11,372? The site says that's because of a number of factors, including inadequate indexing of legislation in the early years of Congress.
Of those 11,372 proposed amendments, only 27 have been approved by Congress and ratified by the states. Why such a low success rate? Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is ""an extremely complicated process"" and an amendment ""essentially only gets adopted when there’s a broad national consensus on the issue.""
University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed, noting that ""the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process. A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics, quite likely forever. So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently.""
Most proposals aren’t inspired by a broad national consensus, however. The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political. ""Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesn’t like, someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter,"" Ritchie told us.
For example, the day after the Supreme Court ruled flag burning to be protected speech in 1989, U.S. Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., introduced an amendment outlawing desecration of the flag . Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since, spanning more than two decades.
Many amendments are introduced many times. An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade, including four times in a single session of Congress . Some are introduced many times but with variations. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, members of Congress introduced amendments that would provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol . The amendments varied on what constituted that ""mass vacancy"" and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen. None of the amendments passed.
Back to Becerra. He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified. He said 11,000; the official count puts the number at approximately 11,372. That's close enough to earn a True.",1,Xavier Becerra
"""Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ "" Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens is expected to go to trial in May on a felony indictment of invasion of privacy related to an allegation that he took a photo of a woman who was partially nude without her consent.
Greitens admitted the extramarital affair with his former hairdresser in January, but described it as consensual and denied allegations that he threatened her. Greitens, a combat veteran and a Republican , was elected governor in 2016.
How Greitens behaved during the affair, and especially whether he had specific sexual interactions with the woman without her consent, have become key points of dispute.
An April 8 headline on the Sentinel, a website that writes about government in Missouri, said that his accuser ""admits photo session may have been a dream.""
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found news reports show the woman did make this statement in a deposition, but the Sentinel omitted a complete explanation about the woman’s testimony.
The Sentinel quoted from a few paragraphs in a defense motion filed on behalf of Greitens April 8.
When the defense counsel asked the woman, ""Did you ever see (Greitens) in possession of a camera or phone?"" she answered: ""Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.""
An assistant circuit attorney asked the woman, ""Did you see what you believed to be a phone?""
She answered, ""… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.""
Jack Cashill, co-editor of the Sentinel, told PolitiFact that he didn’t have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing.
""It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headline ‘may have,’ "" he said, noting that other news outlets including the Daily Mail used a similar approach in headlines.
Greitens has seized on the dream portion of the woman’s statement, telling media that the case is ""a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream.""
Other news reports state that that the woman’s testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours.
The Associated Press wrote that ""the prosecutor in the case says the defense ‘cherry picked bits and pieces’ of her nine-hour deposition and the woman's attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo.""
The Missouri House committee investigation into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment, but stated in a footnote that the committee ""includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition.""
The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens, ""I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold.""
The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness. Greitens did not testify before the House committee.
St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before they're made public. Without the deposition, we can’t fully evaluate the woman’s comments.
The woman’s attorney, Scott Simpson, said in statement to media that the woman supports the release of the full transcript.
Simpson said that Greitens ""has admitted to my client, on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent, and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship.""",1,The Sentinel
"""I saved the taxpayers $2-billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal where people went to jail."" At the CNN/YouTube debate on Nov. 28, 2007, the Republican candidates were asked how they would tackle the national debt and control spending. CNN's Anderson Cooper called on Sen. John McCain, who said: ""I have the record of fighting against wasteful spending. I have a clear record of winning. I saved the taxpayers $2-billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal where people went to jail.""
Indeed, McCain was front and center in a well-publicized effort that killed an Air Force plan to lease 100 Boeing 767s and use them for refueling tankers. The plan eventually led to one of the more notable Washington scandals in years, resulting in prison terms for Mike Sears, a top Boeing official, and Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's No. 2 weapons buyer. Druyun admitted to giving Boeing preferential treatment and negotiating a $250,000-a-year job with the company while overseeing the deal.
It is well-documented in media and government reports that McCain was quick to identify the $23.5-billion deal as a bad one for taxpayers. He found it in December 2001, tucked into a little-noticed amendment to the 2002 defense budget.
Earlier that year, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Boeing had convinced the Air Force that it could start replacing its aging fleet of refueling tankers more quickly by leasing the aircraft rather than purchasing them. Air Force officials acknowledged that leasing would be more expensive, but they said the estimated extra cost — $150-million — was worth it.
There were two problems. One, the Air Force previously expressed no great urgency to replace its tanker fleet. Two, government investigations prompted by McCain's public outrage found that the Air Force vastly underestimated the extra cost of leasing. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office put the extra cost at $1.3-billion to $2-billion, which is where McCain gets his number.
Other senators and watchdog groups took up the fight against the deal, but only after McCain and his staff revealed the makings of a scandal. A 2005 report by the Defense Department's Inspector General found that the Air Force circumvented normal procedures, conducted no analysis of the alternatives to leasing and collected no pricing data to justify the deal.
""If it wasn't for Sen. McCain, the scrutiny that occurred about this deal would never have happened,"" said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""It was probably the best example of oversight in the 108th Congress.""
Boeing paid a record $615-million to settle the civil and criminal allegations that arose in the scandal.
Since the tanker deal never went through, it's hard to say McCain saved taxpayers $2-billion. It might be more accurate to say he kept the government from entering into a deal that would have caused it to overspend by as much as $2-billion.",1,John McCain
"According to ""independent experts,"" Donald Trump's tax plan ""would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy."" During the first presidential debate of 2016, Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trump’s latest tax plan, saying it would explode the debt and hike taxes for some middle-class Americans.
""Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that (his tax plan) would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy,"" Clinton said.
The Clinton campaign pointed us to an analysis by Lily L. Batchelder, a professor at New York University Law School.
When we asked her whether Clinton’s phrasing accurately summarized her findings, Batchelder said it did.
""Yep, that’s totally accurate,"" she told PolitiFact.
We’ll look at the two parts of Clinton’s statement in turn, focusing on the revised plan Trump unveiled at a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 15, 2016. (Click the links for details on the plans.)
Debt increase
In her paper, published a little more than a week after Trump offered his revised plan, Batchelder wrote that her calculations suggested that ""Donald Trump’s latest tax plan would cost more than $5 trillion over 10 years.""
One can argue that Batchelder is not an ""independent expert"" -- she worked for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus as chief tax counsel of the Senate Finance Committee from 2010 to 2014 and as the deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama in 2014 and 2015.
However, a more conservative group, the Tax Foundation , came up with a similar calculation in its own analysis.
According to its model, Trump’s plan ""would reduce federal revenue"" -- in other words, add to the debt -- ""by between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion"" without taking into account increased economic growth estimates due to the plan’s tax cuts. (The Tax Foundation did note that this debt increase was smaller than what it had projected for earlier versions of Trump’s plan.)
Finally, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a group that favors deficit reduction, wrote that its update found that ""both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law – though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more. ... Specifically, we estimate Clinton’s plans would add $200 billion to the debt over the next decade, while Trump’s plans would add $5.3 trillion.""
So Clinton seems on solid ground for this part of the statement.
Tax hikes
Batchelder’s paper is the primary evidence here (along with a separate analysis by a liberal group, Citizens for Tax Justice).
""Despite its enormous price tag, his plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low- and middle-income families with children, with especially large tax increases for working single parents,"" Batchelder wrote. ""I conservatively estimate that Trump’s plan would increase taxes for roughly 7.8 million families with minor children. These families who would pay more taxes represent roughly 20 percent of households with minor children and more than half of single parents. They include roughly 25 million individuals and 15 million children.""
Batchelder cites several reasons for why some families would see a tax increase, including Trump’s exchange of a new standard deduction for personal exemptions; his repeal of the head of household filing status, which benefits unmarried taxpayers with dependents; his exchange of a 10 percent bracket for a 12 percent bracket; and the reality that his new tax deduction and credit for child care would provide relatively little benefit to low- and middle-income caretakers.
The Tax Foundation’s report didn’t address this issue, noting instead that as a rule, taxpayers in all income groups would see more money in their pocket if Trump’s plan was enacted.
However, the Tax Foundation did find substantially bigger gains for wealthy Americans, which is consistent with Clinton’s statement that Trump’s plan would ""disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy."" It found that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would receive an income bump of between 0.8 percent and 1.9 percent, compared to 5.4 percent to 9.3 percent for the top 10 percent of taxpayers and between 10.2 percent and 16.0 percent for taxpayers in the top 1 percent.
More to the point, the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau tweeted favorably about Batchelder’s finding that some taxpayers would experience tax hikes, saying, ""We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me.""
Another tax policy group, the Tax Policy Center, has not released an analysis of Trump’s most recent plan.
The Trump campaign sent us a paper defending the tax proposal. However, it was not ""independent"" since it was written by a pair of ""senior policy advisors to the Trump campaign.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"McCain voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase. Team Obama has been trolling through John McCain's voting record in the Senate, and this nugget landed in vice presidential candidate Joe Biden's Aug. 27, 2008, convention speech: ""He voted 19 times against the minimum wage for people who are struggling just to make it to the next day."" (We'll give Biden a pass for skipping the word ""raising,"" which was in his prepared remarks.)
We combed through McCain's minimum wage votes and found that not all of 19 in opposition to increases were pure votes on the minimum wage, and some were procedural, as is the Senate's way.
But McCain has voted repeatedly, 19 times, against Democratic attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Most recently, McCain voted against a spending bill in March 2007 that included the wage hike. Earlier that year, he voted against stopping debate on a stand-alone wage-hike bill, which in Senate parlance is equivalent to voting no.
Let's put an important caveat on this issue, however. McCain has often voted for minimum-wage increases. In 2007, he voted for passage of a bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25, after it was packaged with business tax breaks designed to soften the blow of the wage increase.
And a few months later, he voted for the final version of the bill that made that wage hike into law. It was packaged in a large spending bill with war funding that did not include a goal for withdrawing troops from Iraq, unlike the earlier bill that he voted against. To show how confusing Senate votes can get, Barack Obama voted against the final spending bill and wage hike because of the Iraq policy. Biden was one of 37 Democrats to vote for the bill.
McCain has also voted for Republican-sponsored minimum-wage proposals that would have meant smaller increases than what the Democrats wanted. For instance, on June 21, 2006, he voted against an amendment from Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy that would eventually have raised the minimum wage to $7.25. But on the same day, McCain voted for an amendment from Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi that would have raised the wage to $6.25. That sort of conflicting, confusing pile of votes is just the nature of the Senate.
McCain has said he opposes Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage and index it for inflation, telling a business group in June that it and other Obama proposals are ""a sure way to add to your costs and to slow the creation of new jobs.""
Let's look at the big picture. Generally, on minimum-wage issues, McCain has been in the middle of the Senate Republicans. He's not one of the few GOP members who regularly vote for Democratic proposals. But he also wasn't one of the three conservatives who voted against the 2007 wage hike, even after the tax breaks were added.
Biden, however, never made any claim about McCain's votes for minimum-wage bills or his overall record. All he said was that McCain cast 19 votes against raising the minimum wage, and that's True.",1,Joe Biden
"""The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."" After criticizing conservative blogs and Republican lawmakers for perpetuating false facts, Rachel Maddow made an interesting claim on her show on Monday, August 2, 2010.
Maddow said that Republicans consistently distort immigration issues to stir up their base during an election cycle.
""Illegal immigration always has to be refashioned into a crisis for every electoral cycle that Republicans want to use it,"" said Maddow. ""The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."" Maddow then showed a graph of apprehension rates of illegal immigrants from 1978 to 2008 that showed that the rate in 2008 was the lowest in years.
We were curious to see if Maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse.
The graph that Maddow displayed on the show was from a fact sheet published by the Department of Homeland Security. The graph displays border apprehensions by year. There is no way to know exactly how many people illegally cross the U.S. border every year, but ""apprehensions seem to be an indicator of inflows of undocumented Mexicans"" crossing the border illegally, according to Jeff Passel, a senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center.
According to the DHS fact sheet, ""the number of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol declined for the third year in a row to 724,000 in 2008 after reaching a mid-decade peak of 1,189,000 in 2005.""
However, some immigration experts do not consider apprehension rates to be particularly useful. Although the apprehension rate is usually a good indicator of trends, it is not exact, according to Bryan Griffith, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of increased border enforcement. ""Just because the apprehension rate is down, doesn't mean less people are trying to come. It could mean they're getting better"" at not getting caught.
Maddow decided to use apprehension statistics to make her point about illegal immigration. However, illegal immigration is about more than illegal border crossings. ""Focusing on the number of people crossing the border alone is just inaccurate,"" said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Apprehension rates are useful, ""but don't tell you the whole story."" For instance, it is estimated that as many as 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. entered legally, but overstayed their visas.
The whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the United States. Using monthly Census data, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that ""the illegal population declined 13.7 percent (1.7 million) from a peak of 12.5 million in the summer of 2007 to 10.8 million in the first quarter of 2009."" This is similar to DHS estimates, which also saw a downward trend from a peak of 11.8 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009.
Even though Maddow didn't use those statistics, they back up her claim. Illegal immigration is not increasing, and by at least two measurements, illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better. But don't herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet.
It's important to note that the decline in the number of undocumented workers sneaking across the border may have less to do with a more secure border and more to do with a less secure economy in the U.S. The DHS report speculates that the decrease in inflow may be due to ""declining U.S. economic growth and enhanced border enforcement efforts.""
Passel thinks it has more to do with the former than the latter. ""It's not that we're discouraging people,"" said Passel, ""It's because they know they can't get jobs because of the economic downturn."" Passel said that his data shows that ""from 1992 through about 2004 the U.S. employment rate and the volume of the numbers of Mexicans coming to the U.S. are almost perfectly correlated."" This seems to indicate that illegal immigration inflows are primarily related to economic considerations.
""It's both economic and enforcement,"" said Griffith.""The more difficult you make the trip, the less people are going to attempt to make that trip.""
However, if the unemployment rate drops and more jobs are available, it's likely that more people will risk crossing the border, because the benefits are worth the risk, according Carafano. The test is whether the illegal immigrant population will continue to decline after the economy picks up.
By two key measurements, the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border are not increasing. At least for the time being, the numbers in both counts are going down. But when the economy picks up again, it is possible that illegal immigration will once again increase.",1,Rachel Maddow
"""We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality."" It is a common refrain among politicians lamenting the state of America's health care system: spending more on health care doesn't necessarily make the United States a healthier country.
That's a theme repeated in the report accompanying the Democratic Party's convention platform. It claims, ""We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality.""
The first part of the statement is certainly true. The United States has spent more per capita on health care than any other country for decades, and its spending has grown faster, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis shows that in the most recent figures available, U.S. spending on health care per capita was $5,711 in 2003. The second-place finisher, Luxembourg, spends $4,611.
As for life expectancy and child mortality, the Democratic National Committee couldn't provide the source for the platform committee's statistics. But the numbers do match Census Bureau statistics that are used in the CIA's 2008 World Factbook, which shows the United States ranks 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality.
You might see different rankings depending on where you look. The United States scores better in lists compiled by the World Health Organization or the United Nations.
That's because each of these organizations ranks countries differently. The U.S. Census Bureau includes many more places in its rankings, such as tiny territories and small chunks of countries, as the Wall Street Journal's ""The Numbers Guy"" blog has pointed out.
Still, no matter whose list you check, there's no denying that the United States' infant mortality rate is higher than other large industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Japan. And this is true despite the United States being the world leader in spending. We give the Democratic platform committee a True.",1,Democratic National Committee
"Preventive care does not save the government money. The logic behind preventive care seems simple enough: stopping illnesses before they happen will mean fewer pricey procedures at the hospital and lower health care costs for all.
Not so, says columnist David Brooks, who was interviewed on the Aug. 14, 2009, edition of the  NewsHour with Jim Lehrer  .
He said President Barack Obama claims that ""preventive care saves money,"" but the reality is ""that's not true. ... If you're testing people, say, for an illness, you have to give 100 people a test to get five people — to find five people. Now, preventive care is good for health. Everyone agrees on that. But if you look at the CBO studies and the other research, it doesn't save you money. We should do it. But because you have to test so many people to get the few you're really going to prevent serious illness from, you're really not adding up to a lot of cost saving.""
Brooks was talking about a core principle of Obama's health care overhaul: That many costly procedures and treatments can be prevented by catching disease earlier or preventing it all together. Operating under that logic, the House health care bill expands access to procedures such as hypertension screening and vaccines.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer sang the praises of preventive care in an Aug. 10  USA Today  op-ed. ""Reform will also mean higher-quality care by promoting preventive care so health problems can be addressed before they become crises,"" they wrote. ""This, too, will save money. We'll be a much healthier country if all patients can receive regular checkups and tests, such as mammograms and diabetes exams, without paying a dime out-of-pocket.""
Brooks's critique relied on new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate that preventive care isn't as cost-effective as Pelosi and Hoyer claim.
""The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate.
Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive:
""But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it.""
In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on.
The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care.
""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"" according to the paper. ""Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.""
And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, ""as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs.""
So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it's a stretch to say that it will save government spending on health care. As a result, we give Brooks a True.",1,David Brooks
"Hillary Clinton advocates ""a freeze on foreclosures. Barack Obama said no."" A new Hillary Clinton ad highlights sharp differences between Obama and Clinton on gas taxes and housing.
""When the housing crisis broke, Hillary Clinton called for action -- a freeze on foreclosures. Barack Obama said no.
""Now, gas prices are skyrocketing, and she's ready to act again. Hillary's plan: Use the windfall profits of the oil companies to pay to suspend the gas tax this summer. Barack Obama says no, again.""
We looked at Obama's position on a gas tax holiday previously . He does oppose it, calling it an expensive, short-term fix with little impact for consumers or national energy policy.
On housing, Clinton wants lenders to freeze foreclosures for 90 days on owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages. She wants lenders to freeze interest rates on subprime loans for owner-occupied homes for five years, or until homeowners can refinance. She wants to create a $30-billion fund for states to deal with the effects of foreclosures, everything from helping individual homeowners pay their bills to making up lost property tax revenues for police and firefighters.
Clinton believes lenders should voluntarily embrace the freezes she suggests as a means of preventing widespread defaults. She would not impose the freezes through the force of law.
Obama, on the other hand, opposes interest-rate freezes and a foreclosure freeze. He and his advisers have said that across-the-board freezes on foreclosures and interest rates are short-term fixes. The measures could end up doing more harm than good if lenders decide to raise interest rates on new homeowners to make up their losses, the campaign has said. He favors a $10 billion fund that would help homeowners avoid foreclosures. He also proposes reforms to bankruptcy court that would allow judges to modify mortgage terms.
Of course, Clinton's ad doesn't explain any of that. But it's not wrong when it says that Obama opposes the foreclosure freeze.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan."" In the six months since a gunman killed his mother, six educators and 20 children in Newtown, Conn., gun control legislation has ground to a halt in Congress. In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence.
Vice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, ""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That's no way to run a country.""
Obama repeated Biden’s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers.
The White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a fact sheet updated daily by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure.
Firearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a database assembled by Slate, an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown.
The numbers back up Biden’s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That’s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012.
We should note that Slate’s statistics don’t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions.
Also, Biden's comparison doesn't take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size.
When Biden said ""that’s no way to run a country"", that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000.
To make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That’s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown.
A similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000.
To get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we went to a database run by the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That’s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war.
Lastly, it’s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime.
Biden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting.",1,Joe Biden
"Says he eliminated an EPA rule that treated spilled milk like it was oil. In making the case for sensible federal regulations, President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address pointed to a rule that he eliminated because it was about as antiquated as a milkmaid.
""We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil,"" Obama said in the Jan. 24, 2012, speech.
Absurd as it may sound, the Environmental Protection Agency has long regulated milk the same way it does petroleum because of milk’s butter fat content. Vegetable oils fall in the same category.
According to the EPA’s website, milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of President Richard Nixon.
The EPA site says ""since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act.""
In February 2009, the EPA announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Here’s what the announcement said:
""EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade ""A"" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,"" or similar state laws.
In simple English, that means large milk storage containers will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws.
The change took effect in April 2011.
""EPA determined that this unintended result of the current regulations – which were designed to prevent oil spill damage to inland waters and shorelines – placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers,"" the agency said in a press release .
We’re not addressing Obama’s projection of costs of $10,000 to some farmers, but we note that the EPA estimated that the rule change would save the industry $140 million a year.",1,Barack Obama
"""Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock."" During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered extended comments on ""the increasing number of children being born out of wedlock in America"" and ""teens who are sexually active.""
Santorum said, ""What we're seeing is a problem in our culture with respect to children being raised by children, children being raised out of wedlock, and the impact on society economically, the impact on society with respect to drug use and all -- a host of other things when children have children. … Two days ago on the front page of the New York Times, they're talking about the same thing. The bottom line is we have a problem in this country, and the family is fracturing.
""Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock. How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically? It's five times the rate of poverty in single-parent households than it is in two-parent homes. … We hear this all the time, cut spending, limit the government, everything will be fine. No, everything's not going to be fine.""
Santorum touched on a lot of issues -- and essentially sidestepped the question from moderator John King, who had reminded him that ""you told an evangelical blog, if elected, you will talk about what, quote, 'no president has talked about before -- the dangers of contraception.' Why?""
For this item, we’ll focus on the main statistic he offered -- that ""over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock.""
Simply put, he’s right.
According to 2009 data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 41 percent of all births were to unmarried women. The percentage has risen steadily since at least 1980, the earliest year for which data was provided in the CDC report. In 1980, it stood at 18.4 percent. By 1990, it was 28.0 percent. And by 2000 it was 33.2 percent.
""It has been increasing over the last 50 years,"" said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
While we’re on this topic, we’ll also look at an issue that Mitt Romney brought up later in the debate -- that ""among certain ethnic groups, the vast majority born out of wedlock."" This data is also included in the CDC report.
In 2009, 17 percent of births to Asian-Pacific Islanders were out of wedlock, with non-Hispanic whites at 29 percent, 53 percent for Hispanics, 65 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans and 73 percent for non-Hispanic blacks. So Romney’s claim would be accurate at least for American Indians and non-Hispanic blacks.
Meanwhile, within age groups, unmarried births accounted for 87 percent of those to teenagers and 62 percent of births to women age 20 to 24. About 20 percent of births to women age 30 and over were to unmarried mothers.
But births to unmarried teens as a percentage of all unmarried births has declined. Unmarried teen births (those to mothers from age 15 to 19) represented 21 percent of all unmarried births, which is far lower than the rate in 1970, which was 49 percent.",1,Rick Santorum
"""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough."" Just a few hours before President Donald Trump was set to announce whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz questioned the president’s reported intent to walk away from the accord.
""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?"" the representative from Florida tweeted June 1.
Trump’s promise to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter .
News outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius.
Wasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement ""wasn’t tough enough."" Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement.
The Paris Agreement
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua.
The UNFCCC’s ultimate goal is ""preventing ‘dangerous’ human interference with the climate system,"" that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC’s website.
Parties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement , seeking ""to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change."" One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
A total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19.
Overall total signatories: 195 .
The only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua.
The Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement . So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement.
Wasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants.
Reuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement ""saying it did not do enough to protect ‘Mother Earth,’ in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted.""
The news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were ""not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change,"" Reuters reported .
""We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,"" Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: ""It’s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it’s a matter of the developing countries surviving.""
In September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation’s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue.
""Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient,"" and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016.
Nicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua’s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change.
Amid a civil war since 2011, Syria’s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions.",1,Debbie Wasserman Schultz
"Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion. To make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping, a new web ad from former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey.
In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,"" then saying, ""I have consistently been pro-life.""
Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on abortion. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate.
First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.
•  In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that lmade abortion legal in every state, Romney added, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
•  In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""
We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.
What about his views today? The ""issues"" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.
""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.
""I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries.  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.
""I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.""",1,Jon Huntsman
"""Texas Church shooter was Antifa and wanted to start (a) ‘communist revolution.’ "" A fake news story about the killer in a mass shooting at a Texas church said the gunman was an anti-fascist looking to sow chaos in the hope of starting a civil war.
The headline on a Nov. 5, 2017, story on ThirdEstateNewsGroup.com read, ""Texas Church shooter was Antifa and wanted to start ‘communist revolution.’ "" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news.
The story appeared the same day 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed at least 26 people in First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. It said Kelley was ""an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by ‘targeting white conservative churches’ and causing anarchy in the United States.""
The post also said he ""was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers ‘this is a communist revolution’ before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.""
None of those details have been confirmed by law enforcement agencies, or reported by reputable media outlets. Authorities said their initial investigation showed the attack was likely motivated by a family dispute, and not a broader movement.
The story was an incomplete copy of a longer post on fake news website YourNewsWire.com , which attributed many of its assertions to Kelley’s alleged Facebook profile.
""Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included ‘Civil and social rights’ and ‘Civil rights’ as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons,"" the post read.
YourNewsWire.com claimed that they had Facebook images of Kelley and an AR-15-style rifle, although there was no indication it was the Ruger AR-556 rifle police have reported finding at the scene.
We could not find a Facebook profile for Kelley, so we could not independently verify the content of his alleged profile. The  Washington Post  and  Los Angeles Times , among others, reported that the profile with those photos had been taken down shortly after the shooting.
The top of the YourNewsWire.com story contained the two images, plus a third of an Antifa flag. Antifa United debunked the use of the flag image in a Facebook post.
""Let's go ahead and lay this to rest right now. The far-right (badly) put together a collage of images/mock up of a FB profile and are claiming the Texas shooter uploaded a picture of his antifa flag. How do we know its fake?"" the group posted on Nov. 5 . ""That's OUR picture. Pulled from our shop website when we had that flag design in stock. The person holding it in the picture is me. The admin of this page. In my office. You can only see a part of my torso but yeah…""
For the record, the only official image of Kelley released by authorities was his drivers license photo .
The YourNewsWire.com post also contained an image that purported to show two individuals having a text conversation about the shooting, with one of them saying they had ""talked to some people who were inside.""
There was no attribution for the conversation, which contained some of the bogus details YourNewsWire.com was reporting — including the Antifa flag, the number of shooters and a reference to Das Kapital, a Karl Marx book criticizing capitalism.
We attempted to contact Baxter Dmitry, who is listed as the author on the post, to confirm the sources of these details, but did not get a reply.
The idea that Kelley was an antifa member targeting conservatives was a popular talking point among the so-called alt-right following the shooting. Other conservative outlets focused on Kelley’s supposed atheism and Facebook ""like"" of CNN .
The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed on Nov. 6 that it appeared Kelley’s attack was related to a family dispute.
""This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs,"" agency spokesman Freeman Martin said in a news conference. ""There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws.""
CNN reported that Kelley killed his wife’s grandmother , Lula White, in the attack. NBC reported he may have been targeting his mother-in-law.
""The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,"" Freeman said. ""We know that … she had received threatening texts from him.""
He declined to elaborate, saying the investigation was ongoing.",0,YourNewsWire.com
"Says Donald Trump ""supports eminent domain"" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision. Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain.
Eminent domain is the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth , a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision.
""The Supreme Court’s Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Conservatives have fought this disaster. What’s Donald Trump say about the decision?""
The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. ""I happen to agree with it 100 percent,"" Trump said.
The narration picks back up: ""Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights.""
Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride?
Club for Growth described it as ""eminent domain abuse"" -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion.
Trump and Kelo
The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didn’t want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the government’s eminent domain powers.
In a liberal majority 5-4 decision , the Supreme Court found in New London’s favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.
At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growth’s ad. Here’s an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Fox’s Neil Cavuto:
Cavuto: ""What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision?""
Trump: ""Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, ‘Will Donald Trump take over your home?’ sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in.
""But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good.""
As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property.
In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jersey’s casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead.
The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later.
So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid 2000s, but what does he think of it now?
His current views
It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Fox’s Bret Baier asked Trump, ""What do you think of eminent domain?""
""I think eminent domain is wonderful,"" Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows ""better than anybody"" how frustrating it can be when you’re building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell.
""And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory,"" he said. ""I think eminent domain is fine.""
Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives.
""I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject,"" Trump said. ""I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives.""",1,Club for Growth
"""Charlottesville car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter."" Internet posts claim an anti-Trump liberal was behind the wheel of the Dodge Challenger that drove into a crowd in Charlottesville, Va., killing one and injuring 19 others.
But the posts are based on false, distorted and discredited information.
The headline on an Aug. 12, 2017, PuppetStringNews.com post read, ""Friendly Fire … Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter."" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to fight fake news.
The PuppetStringNews.com story said someone named Joel Vangheluwe (pronounced ""vangelloway,"" with a hard g) — and not the suspect arrested, James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio — drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested.
Soon after, PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said the Challenger had actually belonged to Vangheluwe, who was ""a known antifa/anti Trump supporter.""
Antifa is shorthand for antifascist. It’s a catch-all term for demonstrators who organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. The loosely coordinated movement has roots in antifascist groups in Germany, Italy and Spain before World War II , and has grown increasingly visible in its opposition to Trump and his ""alt-right"" supporters.
PuppetStringNews.com alleged that Vangheluwe, whose Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home , drove the Challenger into the crowd to make it look like a Trump supporter had attacked the protesters.
There’s no proof Vangheluwe was involved in any way.
Ohio vehicle records showed the 2010 Dodge Challenger is currently registered to Fields, who was at the Charlottesville rally and arrested shortly after the incident . Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, and was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14 .
The PuppetStringNews.com post included a batch of images of Facebook and Instagram posts from Joel Vangheluwe and registration information from SearchQuarry.com that showed Joel’s father, Jerome, had once owned the car:
It appears these images originated on 4chan.org , an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories.
But none of the so-called evidence showed anything proving Vangheluwe was a violent, left-wing extremist.
One Facebook image dated July 4, 2015 , that was posted on PuppetStringNews.com showed Vangheluwe did have a liberal bent:
""Nationalism is brainwash, we'll always be separated until we come together, shit man the world and its people are beautiful. Not just America, pro world,"" Vangheluwe’s caption read.
Another image apparent in the PuppetStringNews.com post showed a June 15 Instagram photo of Vangheluwe wearing a shirt with Jimi Hendrix on it. Vangheluwe’s selfie was simply announcing two art shows in Detroit:
The most outspoken post on any of his social media profiles looked to be from Jan. 24, when he wrote, ""If only Trump was aborted"" as a Facebook status:
The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe.
Sommerman said that Jerome Vangheluwe, Joel’s father, did own the Challenger years ago, and that Joel Vangheluwe did not like Trump, but any implications beyond that are, to use Sommerman’s word, ""nuts.""
""He said some negative things about Trump that aren’t nice,"" Sommerman said. ""He doesn’t support the president in everything he does.""",0,PuppetStringNews.com
"Says there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville. An Internet post that claimed Democrats planned the demonstrations against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., tracks back to a Craigslist ad calling for people to be paid for filler crowds in North Carolina.
""Internet sleuths just found the smoking gun on Dems planning violence in Charlottesville,"" declared the headline on an Aug. 14, 2017, post on NewsUpToday.com . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to curb fake news on the site.
The post, which we also saw on other websites , said that violent clashes Aug. 12 between white nationalists and people demonstrating against their Unite the Right rally were possibly the result of a coordinated protest.
""The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want,"" the post read. ""Users on Reddit found a potential smoking gun Craigslist post seeking to hire protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina for ‘rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.’""
The post included an image of a Craigslist ad for a company called Crowds On Demand, ""a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events."" The ad, which said it had been posted a week prior, was ""looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events.""
Note that said Charlotte, N.C., and not Charlottesville, Va. Both cities were named for King George III’s wife, Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz , but that’s about all the two places share.
Online detectives focused on a portion of the ad that read, ""Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.""
It said the pay was typically $25 per hour, plus travel expenses to an event. The Craigslist ad asked interested people to reply to the ad, which has been repeatedly flagged for removal and then restored by Craigslist. During the research for this fact-check, it had been flagged and restored twice, but is unavailable as of this writing.
""This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate ‘white nationalists’ and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos,"" the NewsUpToday.com post read.
That’s hardly a ""smoking gun"" implicating Democrats in faking protests and causing violence. The Craiglist ad proves nothing at all, beyond the fact that Crowds On Demand is a real company.
Crowds On Demand hires crowds for events , including political rallies . It’s run by a UCLA political science graduate named Adam Swart, who started the company in 2012 .
Swart has said that his company has been hired by political campaigns before, and that Crowds On Demand will work with any political party. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., for example, had paid Crowds On Demand $15 a head for people to attend events during his 2013 New York City mayoral run, the New York Post reported .
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign also used crowd-hiring services , although they denied it at first. Trump used a different crowd-filling company.
Swart did not return multiple phone calls and emails from PolitiFact asking for comment. He did provide a statement to Snopes.com saying Crowds On Demand didn’t work with either the Unite the Right rally or the counter-protesters.
""We were not involved in any capacity with the recent tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those impacted by the violence,"" the statement read.
Some liberal event organizers we contacted denied using any service to hire protesters.
Walter Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education, had obtained permits for liberal counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Trump had falsely claimed protesters on the left hadn’t gotten permits .)
""As far as I know, and I am very connected to various protest groups involved, there was no use of this kind of company,"" Heinecke told us.
Scott Huffman, who heads the anti-Trump group Indivisible Charlotte in North Carolina, said he had quickly coordinated a candlelight vigil in Charlotte the evening after the attack in Charlottesville. He said close to 400 people attended after he posted a Facebook event inviting people to gather the evening of Aug. 13. Crowds On Demand was in no way affiliated with that vigil, he said.
""At no time has Indivisible Charlotte hired any actors to attend any of our rallies,"" Huffman said.",0,Bloggers
"""No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional."" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to rescind a deferred deportation program, claiming the move is discriminatory and that the program itself has not been ruled unconstitutional.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Sept. 5 the end for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) , an Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally.
The lawsuit from Schneiderman and 15 other attorneys general contends the administration’s action discriminates against Mexican immigrants, who account for 78 percent of DACA recipients. Trump since his campaigning days ""has flagrantly displayed an anti-Latino, particularly anti-Mexican discriminatory animus,"" Schneiderman said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show.
""This is a massively successful program. There is no good reason to shut it down. There's no legitimate reason to shut it down. No court has held it unconstitutional,"" Schneiderman said Sept. 6.
We’ve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers , pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA.
Schneiderman’s claim is clearly stated as a fact. We found that he is right: DACA’s constitutionality has not been determined by courts.
DACA created by 2012 DHS memo
DACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
Napolitano’s memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the department’s priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria.
Napolitano said immigration laws were ""not designed to be blindly enforced"" without considering individual cases and circumstances. ""Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here,"" Napolitano wrote.
DACA is a policy, but it is not a law. It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people who were approved for the program.
Many have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach, rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power.
No court ruling on constitutionality of DACA
There’s debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not, but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued.
""There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional,"" Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University.
A lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. ""So there was never any adjudication on the merits,"" he said.
""To my knowledge, no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds,"" concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University. Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch’s legal authority to implement DACA.
Other experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional.
""It's a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue,"" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for Schneiderman.
Texas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving in place the lower court's ruling.
But when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, it was not on constitutional grounds, Kalhan said, ""but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued.""
A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said.
""And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality—it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing,"" Kalhan said.",1,Eric Schneiderman
"""Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."" Bernie Sanders delivered his long-awaited speech on democratic socialism last week, also outlining his plan for fighting ISIS.
Sanders called for a broad international coalition but stressed that Muslim nations must shoulder the fight, which he called ""a struggle for the soul of Islam."" So far, he said, wealthy and powerful countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have done very little.
""Saudi Arabia, turns out, has the third-largest defense budget in the world,"" Sanders said on Nov. 19 . ""Yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.""
Sanders is correct that Saudi Arabia’s military budget is the third largest in the world. But is he also right that the Saudis aren’t prioritizing ISIS? In a word, yes.
A striking scaleback
The Saudi embassy in Washington did not return our requests for comment. But the Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times article that says, ""Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.""
In 2014, the Houthis — a longstanding Shiite separatist group in northern Yemen, a country with a Sunni majority — rebelled against the Yemeni government and seized the presidential palace. After months of tense peace brokered by the United Nations, the Houthis took over the government and placed the president under house arrest in early 2015.
Saudi Arabia, which has a Sunni majority and is ruled by a Sunni monarch, led a 10-state Arab coalition and launched airstrikes against the Houthis on March 26. It pledged to use 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers. In a month, the Saudis conducted 2,415 sorties (a deployment of an aircraft), releasing at least 1,000 air-to-ground weapons.
Meanwhile, as part of the U.S.-led coalition of 60 countries, Saudi Arabia has also been involved with the international effort against ISIS since September 2014. Since then, it has deployed just four F-15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS. (Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.)
Experts said Saudi Arabia doesn’t publicize the exact number of airstrikes it has carried out, but the data shows that the amount of non-U.S. airstrikes overall has been scaled back since the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen began in late March. Conversely, the United States has beefed up its strikes.
Here’s a chart from Airwars.org , a project tracking the international air war against ISIS, that demonstrates this point:
Data compiled by Airwars.org shows that from Dec. 1, 2014, to Nov. 16, 2015, Arab allies conducted just 143 of the 2,827 airstrikes in Syria, 90 of which occurred before April 3 (intervention in Yemen began March 26). For comparison, Saudi Arabia sometimes conducted as many as 125 strikes a day against the Houthis, according to the BBC .
""Bottom line, Bernie Sanders is right. All the evidence points to it,"" said Chris Woods, an investigative journalist who leads the Airwars project. ""Clearly, we saw with the Saudis a capability unleashed in Yemen that we never saw in Syria.""
""The volume of Saudi military forces deployed to combat the Houthis puts the Saudi deployment against ISIS to shame,"" said David Weinberg, an expert on the Gulf monarchies at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy.
Weinberg looked at tallies from the Defense Department which are consistent with Airwars.org data. He also noted a decline in the number of non-U.S. airstrikes in Syria and ""a pitiful lack of participation by America’s Arab allies in what was supposedly unveiled as a joint U.S-Arab effort when it was launched last fall.""
According to the New York Times article cited by the Sanders campaign, the Saudis flew their last strikes in Syria in September, Jordan in August, and the UAE in March.
Conflicting crises
Riyadh has its reasons for prioritizing the Houthis over ISIS. Among them: Yemen’s proximity , Iran’s gains in the region , sectarianism and, simply put, practicality.
""Yemen is the soft underbelly of the kingdom, and Iranian presence there through its support of Houthis is viewed as an existential threat to the kingdom,"" said David Ottaway, the Middle East specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center.
""In the end, Syria doesn’t border Saudi Arabia like Yemen does,"" said Lori Plotkin Boghardt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""And more fundamentally, the Saudis view Assad as the root of the ISIS problem and have argued from the beginning that Assad has to be defeated first in order to defeat ISIS.""
Saudi Arabia is also somewhat relying on the United States to take on ISIS, added Weinberg of the Defense of Democracies. It’s also politically easier for the Sunni kingdom to mobilize public opinion there against radical Shiites like the Houthis rather than radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS, he said.
The United States, for its part, supports the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen (the Houthis’ slogan is ""Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam""), despite concerns over civilian casualties and possible war crimes. What’s more, Boghardt pointed out, ""the irony and the danger"" is that the conflict in Yemen has given al-Qaida and ISIS room to operate there.
As for ISIS, there’s no question that the Saudis are aware of the threat it poses. The terrorist group has repeatedly targeted the kingdom, bombing mosques and detonating car bombs . Beyond military engagement, the Saudis have foiled terrorist plots and arrested hundreds of ISIS supporters. But experts say the kingdom could be doing a lot more.
""Saudi Arabia really should be doing more to militarily combat the twin scourges of ISIS and al-Qaida,"" Weinberg said. ""Bernie Sanders is right that we should expect more from our Saudi allies in the fight against terror in Syria as well as beyond.""",1,Bernie Sanders
"""We're spending $1 trillion a year on our foreign policy."" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked a political frenzy recently when he alleged that President Obama is responsible for the war in Afghanistan and questioned the prospects of a U.S. victory in the region.
""Keep in mind again, federal candidates, this was a war of Obama's choosing. This was not something that the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in, but it was the president who was trying to be cute by half by building a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be in Afghanistan. Well, if he is such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that's the one thing you don't do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?"" said Steele.
The comments prompted several calls for Steele's resignation among Republicans and conservative pundits.
Steele does, however, have at least one defender: Ron Paul, an outspoken Republican representative from Texas and a former presidential candidate. Asked about the comments in a July 5, 2010, CNN interview, Paul talked about what he sees as widespread public disapproval of the war, including its detrimental financial impact on the U.S. ""We're spending $1 trillion a year on our foreign policy,"" Paul commented.
That caught our attention, so we decided to look into it.
Paul's office sent us an article written by Robert Higgs, a scholar at The Independent Institute, a libertarian-leaning economic research organization.
Higgs argues that looking at how much money goes to the Department of Defense is insufficient. One also has to include the appropriations for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program, the Department of State, the Department of Veterans affairs, and the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending, among other expenses. Crunching the numbers for 2009, Higgs came up with a total that's slightly over $1 trillion.
We consulted numerous defense budget experts on the issue. They all agreed that it depends largely on how one defines ""foreign policy."" Changing the definition means changing the programs that one includes in the calculation, which impacts the total amount.
Winslow Wheeler from the Center for Defense Information sent us a table which details the ""U.S. security"" expenses for 2010. The total comes out to $1021.3 billion, slightly over $1 trillion. The calculation includes the interest on the Department of Defense Retiree Health Care Fund and on debt-financed defense spending.
Cindy Williams, a principal research scientist at the MIT Security Studies Program told us to check out her presentation on historical U.S. defense and foreign affairs spending trends. Looking at projected spending for the year 2010, summing up national defense programs, homeland security programs, and international affairs initiatives totals $841 billion. Add in the VA budget of $125 billion and we get $966 billion. Williams said that she wouldn't include the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending in her own analysis, ""since there is no good way to judge whether debt accumulated because we spent too much on security, or because we raised too little in taxes.""
We also checked with Stephen Donahoe from the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an anti-war lobby. Donahoe told us that their own calculations do not include the entire State Department budget. Still, taking into account Pentagon spending and money that goes into nuclear defense programs, Veterans Affairs, interest payments on defense-related debt, and other related expenses that are scattered throughout the budget, the group arrives at about $1 trillion. The committee acknowledges on its website that the number varies across groups that track defense spending.
Finally, the folks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget crunched the numbers for us. They came up with a total of $935 billion for the year 2010 and $950 billion for 2011 based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Those totals include the Department of Defense, overseas contingency operations, the State Department and other international programs, and ""a few other agencies and programs typically included in a 'security' budget.""
Ron Paul claims that the U.S. spends $1 trillion a year on foreign policy. Our experts acknowledged that the figure largely depends on one's definition of ""foreign policy."" Changing the definition means altering the expenses that one includes in the calculation. There was disagreement, for example, on whether to include the interest payments on debt-financed military spending and how to calculate that debt.
Still, give or take, most of the numbers that the experts threw at us come relatively close to, or even exceed, the $1 trillion mark.",1,Ron Paul
"""At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D."" With thousands of gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, conversation on the May 2, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week quickly turned to U.S. energy policy.
Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, argued that one way to prevent such spills in the future is to transition to a clean energy economy -- which she said will be difficult given how little energy companies invest in research and development.
""At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better ... and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet,"" vanden Heuvel said.
We thought that would be a relatively easy statistic to track down, but it led to a wild op-ed goose chase.
Vanden Heuvel told us she got the information from a David Brooks column in the New York Times last week. His April 29 column lamented the minuscule amount of funding energy companies invest in R&D compared with other industries.
""Technology companies spend 5 percent to 15 percent of revenue on research and development,"" he wrote. ""Energy companies, on the other hand, spend only one-quarter of 1 percent. The federal government spends $30 billion on health research, but only $3 billion on clean energy research.""
But that, in turn, came from another opinion article: Brooks' assistant told us that he got it from an op-ed by Bill Gates and Chad Holliday, former chairman of DuPont, published a week earlier in the Washington Post. Here's what the duo wrote:
""Our country is neglecting a field central to our national prospect and security: energy. Although the information technology and pharmaceutical industries spend 5 to 15 percent of their revenue on research and development each year, U.S. companies' spending on energy R&D has averaged only about one-quarter of 1 percent of revenue over the past 15 years.""
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to our request for more background on the claim. But we found two sources that indicate vanden Heuvel is very close:
A report published by the Brookings Institution last year shows the energy industry output in 2003 was about $1.2 trillion, and it spent about $2.4 billion on research and development -- about 0.2 percent of the industry's total output.
Data from the National Science Foundation published in the federal Statistical Abstract of the United States shows the petroleum and coal products industry spent about 0.3 percent of its net sales on research and development in 2007, the most recent year available. According to the same data, R&D spending has hovered around 0.3 percent for several years.
We also ran vanden Heuvel's claim by two experts who told us that it's pretty accurate.
""It's close to correct,"" said Nate Lewis, a professor at California Institute of Technology who assisted on the Brookings Institution report. ""As a percent of revenue, (the amount the energy industry spends on R&D) is a really small number. The pharmaceutical and intelligence industries spend between 10 and 12 percent on R&D. We're not even in the same ballpark here.""
So, even though vanden Heuvel was relying on another pundit for her claim (and he, in turn, was relying on an op-ed), the number is very close to numbers published by Brookings and the National Science Foundation.",1,Katrina vanden Heuvel
"Sharron Angle ""would eliminate the Department of Education."" The Nevada Senate race between incumbent Democrat Harry Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle has become one of the nation's most bitter, with Angle seeking to make Reid the poster child for the poor national and Nevada economies and Reid trying to portray Angle's staunchly conservative views as out of the mainstream.
In a television ad released Aug. 23, 2010, Reid's campaign says that Angle wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. The ad relies on a clip from an interview Angle did with radio station KNPR, the NPR affiliate in Nevada, on May 19, 2010, when she was running in the GOP primary.
The exchange quoted in the ad begins with the host asking Angle, ""Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?"" Angle replies, ""I would like to go through to the elimination.""
We wanted to look through the rest of the interview to make sure that Angle really does believe that the department should be eliminated.
First, a little background on the Education Department. Its budget for fiscal year 2010 is about $64 billion. Of this, nearly $27 billion consists of Pell Grants, which fund disadvantaged students in college and graduate school. Another $25 billion is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including funding to K-12 school systems around the country. An additional $12 billion comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps fund education for disabled K-12 students. Much of the remainder is spent on educational research.
We went to the archived interview and found that the ad doesn't distort her view. Here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:
""I believe that anything that isn't a federally governed, enumerated power in the Constitution, which means the federal government should be paying out on this, is up for grabs here,"" she said. ""And we have some departments like the Department of Education that passes down policy, one-size-fits-all, that fits no one. Like No Child Left Behind. We need to keep those education dollars right here in the state and put them where they will do the most good, which is right in that clasroom, with that classroom teacher. We need to cut down on those bureaucracies that take those educational dollars that should be going into that classroom.
""And it angers me every time I hear (politicians) say we're going to cut teachers,"" she continued. ""What about the agencies that never see a child, never have been in a classroom, that are passing down policy that actually overburdens our classrooms. What about those? Why don't we cut there?""
That's when the host interjects. ""Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?""
Angle responds, ""I would like to go through to the elimination. I think we start by defunding it, and the reason that we should eliminate it is because its not the federal government's job to provide education for our children. It's a 10th Amendment right. It should be done here in the state, and it should be done as close to the local as possible.""
Reviewing the exchange on KNPR, it seems to us that the ad portrayed Angle's stance accurately. She did not hesitate, backtrack or give any indication that she misspoke, even when the host gave her the opportunity to roll back the scope of her proposal.
She's expressed that position before, in a Mar. 22, 2010, interview with the conservative website Nevada News & Views, when she said she would like to eliminate not just the Education Department but the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as well.
It's worth noting that there's been a long-running constitutional debate about whether the Education Department is legitimate. Erwin Chemerinsky, the liberal dean of the University of California (Irvine) law school, argues that it's proper because of Congress' spending power. Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute counters that the 10th Amendment's assigning of all unlisted powers to the states makes it  ""plain and obvious that there is no constitutional authority"" for it.
Regardless, on the issue raised by Reid's ad -- whether Sharron Angle ""would eliminate the Department of Education"" -- we found that yes, she did say she wanted to do so in several public forums.",1,Harry Reid
"""U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East."" As the high-voltage battle over the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" was raging on Aug. 10, 2010, two Republican lawmakers -- Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and New York Rep. Peter King, the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee -- took aim at the State Department for allegedly footing the bill for foreign travel by the imam behind the proposed center in lower Manhattan.
""It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East,"" the lawmakers wrote . ""Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is –- a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Department’s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration’s policy and funding priorities.""
We're separately looking at other aspects of the controversy here, including some elements of what Ros Lehtinen and King said in their statement. But in this item, we wanted to look at the narrow question of whether the lawmakers were correct that ""U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East.""
At an Aug. 10, 2010, State Department briefing, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs P.J. Crowley confirmed that a program under the State Department's auspices -- the Bureau of International Information Programs -- is paying for Rauf's trip.
""Imam Faisal will be traveling to Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE on a U.S. government-sponsored trip to the Middle East,"" Crowley said. ""He will discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance. ... We have about 1,200 of these kinds of programs every year, of sending experts in all fields overseas. Last year we had 52 trips that were specifically focused on religious -- promoting religious tolerance. We will expect to have roughly the same number of  programs this year.""
On Aug. 18, 2010, Fox News and the Associated Press , citing the State Department, reported that Rauf will be paid $3,000 directly by the U.S. government and that the government will pay for his airfare, lodging and expenses. The total amount for sending Rauf overseas will be roughly $16,000.
Crowley noted that this will be Rauf's fourth trip overseas on the government's dime, including two of them under the administration of former President George W. Bush and one earlier this year.
""In 2007, he visited Bahrain, Morocco, the UAE and Qatar,"" Crowley said. ""And earlier this year, in January, he also visited Egypt. So we have a long-term relationship with him. You know, his work on tolerance and religious diversity is well-known and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what it's like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States. And our discussions with him about taking this trip preceded the current debate in New York over the center.""
So Ros-Lehtinen is correct that the federal government (and, therefore, U.S. taxpayers) will be funding Rauf's trip to the Middle East.
Some commentators have gone a step further by saying the trip is tantamount to a fundraising jaunt for Rauf's center. The Washington Times' editorial page wrote that ""by funding the trip so soon after New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the go-ahead to demolish the building on the proposed mosque site, the State Department is creating the appearance that the U.S. government is facilitating the construction of this shameful structure. It gives Mr. Rauf not only access but imprimatur to gather up foreign cash. And because Mr. Rauf  has refused to reveal how he plans to finance his costly venture, the American public is left with the impression it will be a wholly foreign enterprise.""
Crowley, in his Aug. 10 briefing, was asked about the fundraising issue. He knocked down the notion.
""It is something that we have talked to him about, and we have informed him about our prohibition against fundraising while on a speaking tour,"" Crowley said. ""We do not expect him to fundraise.""
We aren't rating this claim, because we don't believe it's provable either way that the trip will offer fundraising opportunities. On the one hand, the government has made clear that fundraising cannot take place during the trip. On the other hand, it's possible that the trip, indirectly, will raise Rauf's profile with people who hear him speak in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE and, in the process, ease future fundraising for his planned center.
But while we're not taking sides on the fundraising question, we believe that the less-far-reaching statement by Ros-Lehtinen is accurate. U.S. taxpayers are indeed funding Rauf’s trip, as they have his prior two trips to the region. It's worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention, and also that Rauf took his first State Department-funded trip during the Bush administration rather than Barack Obama. But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros-Lehtinen.",1,Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
"""In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%."" Aug. 14, 2010, marked the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act, and in the run-up to that landmark anniversary, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, praised the program in a speech on the House floor.
""On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, President Roosevelt said, 'We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered — an America unclaimed. This is the great, the nationwide frontier of insecurity, of human want and fear. This is the frontier — the America — we have set ourselves to reclaim.' Today, much of that dream has been realized. While we may never completely eradicate poverty, great strides have been made. In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%,"" she said on Aug. 10, 2010.
We don't have the expertise to judge the effectiveness of social safety net programs, but we did want to check Johnson's claim that ""in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%.""
We began with the latter statistic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which has been collecting official poverty data for the past several decades, the poverty rate for individuals 65 and older in 2008 -- the latest year for which data are available -- was 9.7 percent. That's pretty close to the figure that Johnson cited.
The second number was a bit harder to verify. The U.S. Census Bureau did not begin tracking the poverty rate until 1959. On top of that, data for individuals aged 65 and older are not available for the years 1960 through 1965.
We spoke with Deborah Johnson, a senior editor and writer at the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson told us to check out a 1987 study from Eugene Smolensky, Sheldon Danziger, and Peter Gottschalk. The three researchers used data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses to extend the poverty line back to 1939. How did things look back then?
Among men 64 and older, the poverty rate in 1939 was 78 percent. For women, it was 77.5 percent. But what about 1935?
""Even ... 78% would probably be a slightly conservative estimate since poverty for all persons in 1939 was considerably lower in 1939 than in 1935,"" Smolensky wrote us in an e-mail. He said that by his estimates, in 1935, the poverty rate for all families was 69.4 percent. For the elderly, it could have been up to 20 percent higher. Still, the paper also notes that due to changes in the survey methodology, ""data presented here for 1939 are not directly comparable to the data for later years.""
We also looked at research from Robert Plotnick, professor of public affairs at University of Washington. Plotnick and his colleagues (including Smolensky) extended the poverty threshold, adjusting for inflation, back to 1914. In 1935, the poverty rate for the entire U.S. population was 64.9 percent. Plotnick told us that he does not have a breakdown by age, but ""since poverty among elders was consistently higher than for the overall population until the mid 1970s, it would be reasonable to assume poverty among the elders in 1935 was at least 50 percent.""
We asked Johnson's office for a source for the claim and were told that it comes from material that references Growing Old in America, a 1978 publication by David Fischer, now a history professor at Brandeis University. Page 226 contains the statistic that Johnson may have been talking about: ""Dependent poverty among the old grew inexorably, from 23 percent in 1910 to 40 percent in 1930, and 50 percent in 1935.""
The term ""dependent poverty"" puzzled us, and we tried to reach Fischer to clarify what he meant by that, but he did not respond to our query. Plotnick said it is not a standard term currently used in academic literature. After some research, we did find an instance of the term in the writings of Thomas Malthus, the 19th Century English economist known for the Malthusian theory that population, left unchecked, outstrips food supplies and leads to disaster. Malthus used ""dependent poverty'' to describe someone who depends upon charity for survival.
That may be similar to what Johnson was talking about, but it is not the same concept. During her speech, she specifically referenced the U.S. ""poverty rate,"" which is a formal term from the U.S. Census. We talked to some of the top researchers in this field, and they all agreed: the best estimates show that the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was probably somewhere in the range of 70 to 90 percent.
So, to review, Johnson said that ""in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%."" We found no official statistics for the rate of elderly poverty for the year 1935, only academic projections, and making apples-to-apples comparisons between eras is difficult. But those estimates indicate that Johnson may have seriously underestimated the level of poverty for older Americans amid the Great Depression.
Still, Johnson's underlying point stands. The poverty rate among the elderly has dramatically declined. Whether that was the result of Social Security or other factors is beyond the scope of this review. By the best available measures the rate in 1935 was, as she stated, more than 50 percent. And she was just a fraction off on the current level of 9.7 percent.",1,Eddie Bernice  Johnson
"""When people enter the service, there’s not a mental health evaluation."" The second shooting at the Texas military base Fort Hood in less than five years has reopened wounds -- and old debates.
During the Sunday morning political shows on April 6, 2014, typical questions over base security and concealed carry rules on military installations emerged in the wake of the deadly shooting last week, with politicians and pundits mostly assuming their party-line positions.
But there was some bipartisan consensus that the military should take a closer look at the mental health of enlisted service members. On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said the effort should start at sign-up.
""When people enlist in the military, there is a physical check but there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service,"" McCaul. ""I think this will be a good idea to, No. 1, screen out individuals that may have mental illness problems. No. 2, have a baseline so that when they return home, we can compare that to where they are when they come back.""
We were unfamiliar with the process men and women go through to enlist and imagine McCaul’s claim about mental health evaluations caught the attention of viewers as well. So we decided to check it out.
No formal process
Officials have not yet identified a motive that caused Army Spec. Ivan A. Lopez to open fire at the Fort Hood base, killing three and injuring more than a dozen. Lopez was being treated for depression and was screened for post traumatic stress disorder, though Army officials have said mental health was "" not the direct precipitating factor "" in the shooting.
McCaul’s office pointed us to legislation introduced by Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Penn. on March 27, 2014 -- coincidentally, just days before the shooting -- called the ""Medical Evaluation Parity for Service Members Act."" The bill would require a medical evaluation before an individual enlists in the armed forces.
According to the legislation, ""Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health.""
Speaking in favor of the bill, retired Army colonel and director of legislation for the National Guard Association of the United States Peter Duff said, ""Not having a baseline is a neglectful disservice to our military members and veterans who risk their lives for our nation.""
The bill has the support from various military and veteran organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Officers Association, Reserve Enlisted Association, Association of the U.S. Navy, National Military Family Association and Military Officers Association of America, as well as the American Psychological Association.
A mental health examination is not listed in a description of the application procedure on the United State Military Entrance Processing Command website or in the Military Entrance Processing Station regulations .
That’s all pretty strong evidence that no separate examination for identifying mental health disorders in enlistees exists, at least not in a similar form as the physical new recruits must go through.
What does exist?
But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront?
In addition to an aptitude test, as part of the initial screening, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history.
Col. Rebecca I. Porter, chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Army’s Surgeon General, told the Washington Post that the application process ""includes a review of whatever medical records we have available, as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information. We look for past diagnoses or past treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems.""
Porter said a past suicide attempt, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches.
But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems. Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted.
""People who want to come into the Army are no fools,"" Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a former chief psychiatrist in the Army, told the Los Angeles Times. ""They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt, you're probably not going to get in.""
A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the U.S. Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted.
Once enlisted, however, service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment.
""We have a series of evaluation of any soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman who's deployed prior to their deployment,"" Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR. ""They have access to mental health and physical health care providers, as well, while they're on deployment. And when they return from deployment, within 30 days of their being redeployed, they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down-range, which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station.""
Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer . ""If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldier’s behavior, he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic,"" Porter said in her Post interview. ""Or if a commander had questions about a soldier’s fitness for duty, they could do a command-directed mental health evaluation, in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander.""
Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful. Schoomaker, a surgeon in the Army until 2012, recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process ""would just lead to driving the problems further underground.""",1,Michael McCaul
"""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known ... corporate profits are up."" In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama suggested that the economy is in recovery mode.
""We are poised for progress,"" the president told a joint session of Congress. ""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.""
We decided to see if corporate profits are indeed up in the past two years.
Statistics on corporate profits are calculated by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. They are determined both on an annual and a quarterly basis. According to BEA , corporate profits -- officially known as ""corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments"" -- were as follows:
2007: $1.511 trillion
2008: $1.263 trillion
2009: $1.258 trillion
Unfortunately, since we’re only 25 days into 2011, BEA has yet not calculated the figure for 2010, so we’re left to use annualized estimates based on the quarterly figures.
The most recent quarterly estimate, based on the third quarter of 2010, produced annualized corporate profits of $1.659 trillion. Even the lowest annualized estimate for corporate profits, based on the first quarter of 2010, pegged them at $1.567 trillion -- still well above either of the full-year amounts for 2008 and 2009.
So, the only thing that could make Obama’s statement incorrect would be a woeful under performance in the fourth quarter of 2010, but that seems unlikely based on current expert estimates.
Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney, told Bloomberg Businessweek in mid-January that ""the earnings recovery in the U.S. has been exceptional post-crisis. It seems the recovery in the U.S. economy is starting to broaden, which will support revenue and earnings growth. China’s economy is robust, but it’ll take at least six months of strong data to silence those calling a policy-induced hard landing.""
Indeed, if the third-quarter rate holds, corporate profits for 2010 would set a record. The current record was set in 2006 -- the last full year before the onset of the recent recession. That year, corporate profits hit $1.608 trillion.
Of course, corporate profits are just one component of the economy -- and just one part of Americans’ perceptions of how well the nation is doing economically. Unemployment is still stubbornly high, and indeed, some commentators have been critical of companies’ hesitancy to invest on new hires amid such high profits.
Still, Obama was correct in his description of the trend in corporate profits. One could say that he’s being presumptuous by assuming what the full 2010 figure will be before it’s officially announced, but we think that the current trendlines for corporate profits, combined with recent fourth-quarter reports, put the level so far above the 2009 level that it’s highly unlikely to drop once the full-year numbers have been released.",1,Barack Obama
"Says President Barack Obama ""has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation,"" while Congress ""has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history."" When President Barack Obama was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and his critics were chastising him for not visiting flood victims in Louisiana, the liberal group Occupy Democrats created a message on their Facebook page trying to contrast Obama's work record against the Republican Congress.
Below a photograph of Obama are the words, ""Has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation."" Below an image of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are the words, ""Have taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history.""
The introduction to the Aug. 20 image insists, ""The numbers don't lie."" It had been shared 45,470 times by Sept. 6, 2016.
Bad grammar aside (it should be ""fewer"" vacation days, not ""less""), we wanted to know if the data checked out. We repeatedly contacted the group but didn't hear back.
Presidential vacations
First, it's important to realize that if you're only going back a generation (20 years), you're only comparing Obama to two other presidents — Bill Clinton who took office in 1993 and George W. Bush, who was inaugurated in 2001.
We turned to Mark Knoller, White House correspondent at CBS News , the zen master of data on all things presidential such as vacations, trips, news conferences and even teleprompter use.
He told us via email that Obama has been on 28 vacations (including long weekends) spanning all or part of 217 days. The president has just over four months left in his term.
His predecessor, Bush, made 77 visits to his Texas ranch spanning all or part of 490 days. There were also 11 visits to his parent's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spanning all or part of 43 days. Total: 533.
But by Knoller's count, Clinton took the fewest — 174 days of summer vacations on Martha’s Vineyard and at Jackson Hole, Wyo .
So the first part of the Occupy Democrats post is wrong.
(It's also worth noting, as Knoller does , that a president never really goes on vacation. The job goes with him.)
Congressional vacations
We didn't have to go very far back in time to discover that this part of the Occupy Democrats meme is wrong as well.
Defining vacation days for Congress is harder than for a president. After all, when members don't have to be in Washington for a vote, they may be in their districts, meeting with voters, or attending to official duties. And let's be real here — they might also be treating it like a vacation.
As of Sept. 6, 2016 , the House had been in session 94 days. The Senate had been in session 114 days. We decided to start by looking at House calendars.
This year, the House is scheduled to be in session for another 32 days. That means House members will have been officially working in Washington for a total of about 126 days.
That’s more days on the calendar than in 2008 , when House members met for 119 calendar days, and in 2006 , when they met for 104 days.
The House looks even less lazy if you look at 2015 , the first year of the current Congress. That year, the House met for 157 calendar days, more than in 2014 (137 days), 2012 (153 days), 2010 (128 days), 2008 (119 days) and 2006 (104 days).
Alternatively, we looked at the data in two-year blocks, which would be full sessions of Congress . The current House (the 114th session, 2015-16) has met or is scheduled to meet for 283 days. But in the 109th session (2005-06) it met for 247 days, which is 36 days fewer.
In fact, the current session is slated to have more days than the 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th Congresses as well.
We found the same pattern in the Senate, which has met , or is scheduled to meet , for 156 days this year. It didn't matter whether we looked at projected days this year or actual days last year. Since 2000, there were at least six years the Senate met fewer times.
And when we combined House and Senate tallies, the current 114th Congress is on track to have officially worked in Washington more days than the 113th, 109th, 108th, 107th and 106th Congresses.",0,Occupy Democrats
"""Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law."" Black Americans have ""everything"" to lose if Donald Trump becomes president, says a recent ad out of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
""Trump management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law,"" the ad’s narrator says.
The Clinton campaign has run the ad on cable television in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
There has been a lot of reporting on the subject of the Republican nominee’s discrimination lawsuits, so we decided it was about time we looked, too. We found that the government did, in fact, charge Trump and his real estate company with discrimination, in violation of the Civil Rights Act.
Back in 1973, Trump was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management, which operated nearly 40 apartment buildings comprised of about 14,000 residences total, mostly in New York City.
In October of that year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race.
""The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,"" the complaint reads.
Trump and the government eventually settled the claim, so Trump never admitted guilt, but documents prepared by the government describe numerous allegations of race-based discrimination at more than 15 different Trump Management properties.
Many of the incidents involved a black person being told the complex had no availability when apartments were in fact available.
For example, one black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. That was March 18, 1972. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot.
The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people.
In one case, the government claimed the Trump Management comptroller instructed one rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said ""C"" for ""colored"" to every application submitted by a person of color. Another rental agent said Fred Trump told him to encourage black tenants to find other housing in order to decrease the black population at that particular complex.
Donald Trump called the charges ""absolutely ridiculous,"" according to the New York Times article that originally reported the charges back in 1973. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit.
Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but they have continued to deny the charges in recent comments to other news outlets .
Trump and the government settled the case in 1975. Trump Management agreed to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements.
Trump saw the settlement as a success, writing in his 1987 memoir,  Art of the Deal : ""In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt. Instead, we agreed to do some equal-opportunity advertising of vacancies in the local newspaper. And that was the end of the suit.""
Experts told us that settlements don’t mean the parties involved are innocent, though.
The government settles ""north of 98 percent"" of these kinds of housing discrimination cases, and often fairly quickly, said Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to say they’re agreeing to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt.
""That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence"" against Trump, Schwemm said.
The government brought their suit against Trump five years after the Civil Rights Act went into effect. There was plenty of race-based housing discrimination nationwide at that time, Schwemm said. But the government had limited resources dedicated to this issue, so government attorneys prioritized bringing complaints against big ""pattern"" cases that they believed would have a broader impact.
Schwemm said of the 20 to 30 Fair Housing Act cases the government brought against fair housing providers in the first five years, he’s only aware of two in New York, including Trump’s, and very few others in cities outside the southern United States.
A lot of the housing discrimination at that time was subtle — like taking a black person’s rental application and just never looking at it. The more blatant sort of discrimination alleged in Trump’s case, that they coded applications based on race, was ""not unheard of"" but ""pretty extreme,"" Schwemm said.
In 1978, the government wrote a letter to Trump’s lawyers saying they believed the company had violated the settlement by steering black tenants to specific properties, according to the  New York Times . But the government ultimately didn’t pursue the case before the settlement terms expired.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Mitt Romney ""wants to end tax credits for wind producers."" President Barack Obama raised concerns about the future of wind power at a campaign event in Colorado, a state that has done well with wind energy. Over 6 percent of its power comes from wind and a Danish turbine maker recently built a manufacturing plant there.
But the industry is fragile and Obama played to that when he said, ""At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Colorado and Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers.""
Obama was referring to Renewable Energy Production Tax Credits. The president says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of them -- and the Romney campaign agrees.
A Romney spokesman, Ryan Williams, says when the tax credits expire at the end of this year, Romney has no plans to renew them.
""Wind energy will thrive wherever it is economically competitive,"" Williams said.
It's worth noting that Romney's position on the tax breaks for wind energy is a major issue within the wind power industry.
These tax credits have been part of American energy policy since 1992. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. If the average price of electricity is around 8.5 cents, as it was in Colorado in 2010, then the tax break can make wind power more competitive.
The tax credit has come and gone over the years. Investment analyst, Aris Karcanias, managing consultant at Navigant BTM, says as the tax credit goes, so goes the wind industry.
""The Production Tax Credit remains the largest driver of industry growth in the United States,"" Karcanias said. ""And uncertainty over its renewal has historically been accompanied by repeated ‘boom and bust’ cycles of growth.""
The past few years have been one of the ""boom""  times. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wind projects created at least 52,000 jobs between 2009 and 2011. The Congressional Research Service reports that the country will add a record 10 to 12 gigawatts of capacity by the end of 2012.
After the policy runs out, new construction is expected to plummet. But the congressional analysts don’t say that extending it would necessarily lead to an upswing. They say that competition from cheap natural gas and a limited rise in the demand for power will tend to put a damper on the industry regardless of federal tax policy.",1,Barack Obama
"Last year, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour."" President Barack Obama, making the case from the Rose Garden that oil companies would be just fine without tax breaks, offered this striking figure : Last year, he said, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.""
We had to know: Is that true?
Here’s the excerpt from the March 29, 2012, speech:
""It’s not as if these companies can’t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.""
Here’s the math:
Exxon Mobil Corp. estimates it earned $41 billion in 2011.
Divide by 365 days in the year and 24 hours in a day — and that’s $4.67 million.
Every hour.
Obama has previously struggled with the facts about Exxon’s profit. In 2007, he claimed the company’s profits had never been higher, when that wasn’t true at the time. Last year, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was on stronger ground when he declared that ""over the past decade, the big five oil companies — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell — made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion."" PolitiFact Virginia rated that Mostly True .
This time, Exxon answered the president on its blog , saying ""the reality is that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story.""
""Consider if the president had added the following statistics: ExxonMobil’s taxes were $12.3 million an hour, and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. Those statistics are also accurate and they put the $4.7 million an hour in profits in context.""
(We should note that we can’t independently verify the company’s tax bill. As we’ve reported before, the actual income tax, for example, paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. We have dinged politicians for inaccurately characterizing the company’s taxes.)
The company has a point that Obama’s statistic doesn't detail the oil company's expenses. But in this fact-check, we’re focusing just on the claim that, ""Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour."" As a simple snapshot of Exxon’s 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target.",1,Barack Obama
"""As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel."" Following a trip in which he said Israel was blessed by the hand of providence, Mitt Romney is out with an ad questioning President Barack Obama’s allegiance to the Jewish state.
""Who shares your values?"" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. ""As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital.""
Romney, the ad continues, ""will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel.""
The ad closes with clips of Romney giving a speech in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall.
In another fact-check, we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on Jerusalem as the nation's capital.
Here, we ask, has the president been there?
Before he moved to the White House
As an Illinois senator, Obama made his first visit to Israel in January of 2006. In 2008, while running for president, he returned on a multi-nation trip to Israel, Jordan, Germany, France and Britain. That trip, like Romney’s this year, was designed to bolster his foreign policy credentials.
At the time, Obama declared America a friend of Israel and said we ""must always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself.""
But Romney’s ad specified that Obama has not been to Israel ""as president,"" and that assertion is correct.
As it turns out, that’s not unusual.
Our colleagues at the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker column delved into the archives of the historian’s office at the U.S. State Department. According to those records , seven of the last 11 presidents (dating back to Harry Truman who was in the White House when Israel was established) never visited Israel.
The Obama campaign, when we asked for a response , pointed out that Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were among those who never went to Israel. Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were the only ones to visit during their first term. George W. Bush went to Israel twice during his last year in office.
That historical context is noteworthy: A majority of the last 11 presidents did not visit Israel. But the Romney ad’s claim is still accurate.",1,Mitt Romney
"Government orders South African firm ""to lay off 3,389 white employees."" Facebook users set the fake news flags waving when a 2015 news item resurfaced recently. The headline from a website with the URL conservative-headlines.com said, ""South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees.""
""A South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce its number of white employees by 44.3 percent over the next five years,"" the article said. ""This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal ‘Black Empowerment’ program.""
The headline misses the mark on its main points, but behind it lie real events.
PolitiFact Global News Service examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day , April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.""
The conservative-headlines.com website, which features images of the Confederate flag and an op-ed in favor of a white ""ethnostate"" in South Africa, took its story from a prominent Afrikaans language news site Netwerk 24 .
Netwerk 24 was reporting on the affirmative action plans of Eskom, South Africa’s public electric company. South Africa operates under the Employment Equity Act , which says ""employers must make sure designated groups (black people, women and people with disabilities) have equal opportunities in the workplace.""
Netwerk 24 reported the 3,389 figure based, it said, on documents Eskom had submitted to three unions. One of the unions, Solidarity , describes itself has having ""a close relationship with the Afrikaner community."" Solidarity opposes "" reverse racism ,"" and regularly tangles with the government over affirmative action.
The factual part of the claim is this: In November 2014 , the South African Labor Department sent Eskom a report telling it to set numerical targets so that the makeup of its workforce would more closely match that of the country at large. The company had to submit a plan to reach those targets by 2020.
The report itself doesn’t give a number. But if Eskom didn’t come up with a plan and implement it, then the Labor Department could bring a case against it in the government’s Labor Court and seek to impose a fine .
We asked the Solidarity union where it got the figure of 3,389 whites and spokesman Francois Redelinghuys told us ""this number was derived from the employment equity plan Eskom submitted whereby it was envisioned that by 2020 they aim to reduce the amount of white workers as part of their affirmative action strategy.""
Redelinghuys didn’t tell us how the number was derived.
Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told us, meanwhile, that ""there is no such plan"" to layoff white workers.
In Eskom’s 2016 annual report , the company lays out the workforce makeup it hopes to achieve by 2021. For example, the fraction of black employees in senior management is slated to rise from about 61 percent to 89 percent.
It would seem likely that blacks would gain at the expense of whites, but there is no way to translate those changes into absolute numbers. Adding to the complicated picture, the company plans to downsize across the board by about 20 percent.
How this all would shake out racially is unclear. In May 2015, Solidarity said in a press release that in the coming year, Eskom planned to cut 1,689 blacks from its rolls, and 1,080 whites. In other words, blacks would be the bigger losers.
The company distanced itself from those figures , saying they had been part of a draft plan than was never adopted. But in any event, the numbers don’t bolster the broader claim that whites will suffer more than blacks.
If the numbers in the headline are dicey, so is the idea that the government had ""ordered"" Eskom to lay off white workers.
Solidarity spokesman Redelinghuys told us that ""we only said that said amount (of) white worker jobs would be reduced. The media made the article about laying off workers.""
Professor of labor law Christoph Garbers at Stellenbosch University told us that ""the (government’s) report/ recommendation clearly does not say what the article says.""
Garbers said the Labor Department told Eskom to take demographics into account, but ""that is a far cry from interpreting this to mean that Eskom now has to dismiss people.""
Garbers also said that by law and precedent ""you can’t justify dismissal on the basis of affirmative action.""
Eskom’s spokesman told us that to date, not a single worker has been ""retrenched,"" or as we would say in American English, laid off.",0,Bloggers
"When President Barack Obama said ISIS, or ISIL, was contained, he ""was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria."" Last week, President Barack Obama said the Islamic State is ""contained"" -- a comment that has been scrutinized in the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris that have been attributed to the terrorist group.
But has Obama’s comment been taken out of context?
ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos presented White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes with a list of politicians criticizing Obama for his Nov. 12 remarks. Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said Obama sees the world ""as a fantasy.""
Rhodes said Obama was talking about a particular aspect of containment that in no way dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks in the West.
""The president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria,"" Rhodes said, using another acronym for the group. ""A year ago, we saw them on the march in Iraq and Syria, taking more and more population centers. The fact is that we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria. At the same time, that does not diminish the fact that there is a threat posed by ISIL, not just in those countries but in their aspirations to project power overseas.""
This reminded us of a prior fact-check, when Obama said he didn’t specifically describe ISIS as a ""JV team"" -- a statement we rated False because he was clearly talking about the Islamic State at the time. We decided to look back at Obama’s comments on containing ISIS to see his comments in their complete context.
Rewind
In the context of Obama’s Nov. 12 interview with Stephanopoulos -- the day before the Paris attacks -- it’s actually quite clear that when he says ISIS is contained, he is talking about ISIS’s territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq. Here are the relevant parts of the interview:
Stephanopoulos: ""Some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down.""
Obama: ""I think what is true is that this has always been a multiyear project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in sufficient numbers to simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance.""
Stephanopoulos: ""And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?""
Obama: ""Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain. What we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters.""
When Obama said ""we have contained them,"" it’s within a plainly defined scope: ISIS’s territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. This context is bolstered by the fact that Stephanopoulos asks Obama about the ground efforts in those two countries.
He wasn’t saying, as critics have shorthanded, that ISIS no longer presents a threat -- an assertion that the Paris attacks would have negated. In fact, in the same interview, Obama acknowledged that ISIS might have surpassed al-Qaida as the greatest terror threat in the world, adding that they are constantly looking for ""a crack in the system"" to exploit to carry out attacks. ""I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel,"" Obama said.
Is ISIS contained in Iraq and Syria?
The region Obama refers to is significant because it’s the epicenter of ISIS’s caliphate. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said Obama is accurate when he says ISIS hasn’t gained territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, though it does not give a full picture of ISIS’s global reach.
""It’s a choice of words that isn’t great, but what he is referring to -- as opposed to the way people have interpreted it -- is correct,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
While ISIS has captured a couple towns in the past few months, it has ultimately lost roughly a quarter of its Iraq and Syria territory overall. A good portion of the losses resulted from United States airstrikes but also from fighting with Iraqi forces and regional groups , Gartenstein-Ross said. This is a far cry from a year ago, when there was serious concern that ISIS would capture Baghdad.
But even though they haven’t expanded territorially recently, ISIS continues to counterattack anti-ISIS forces in the region, noted Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. He added that ISIS has actually expanded globally -- with strongholds and cells in Libya, Yemen, the Sinai region, and Bangladesh, as well as establishing ties with other terrorist organizations in Africa.
This November map from the Institute for the Study of War shows where ISIS has ties. The stars indicate where ISIS has a remote ""governorate.""
And, as we know from the Paris attacks, ISIS is able to flex their muscle in the West, too.
""They are being contained geographically by traditional military but they are leapfrogging over it using terrorism,"" said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. He added that Obama used ""your grandfather’s notion of containment.""",1,Ben Rhodes
"The United States has ""one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world."" In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama brought up the idea of simplifying the tax code.
""Over the years,"" he said, ""a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change.""
In noting the nation’s high corporate tax rates, Obama offered a statistic that is more often raised by Republicans. But is it right?
We checked this fact before, when it was offered by newly elected Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.
On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Toomey for areas where Obama and congressional Republicans could work together.
""I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities,"" Toomey said . ""Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates, because we have the highest in the world right now.""
Using the most straightforward definition of ""corporate tax rates,"" Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.
We found that for 2010, the U.S ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.
Still, the issue is complicated, so let’s delve a bit deeper.
The OECD rate is the ""statutory"" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But as Obama indicated, many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""
The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out.
The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.
This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.
There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item , we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.
Taking into account these complexities, we rated Toomey’s comment Mostly True. Obama’s statement is actually more accurate than Toomey’s, because he hedges a bit by saying that the United States has ""one of"" the highest corporate tax rates in the world. He's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. And U.S. tax rates also are among the biggest by more nuanced measures.",1,Barack Obama
"""Just in: John Kerry facing prison."" A story on Facebook said that former Secretary of State John Kerry is headed to prison for allegedly meeting with Iranian leaders in an attempt to save the nuclear agreement he helped broker during President Barack Obama’s administration.
""Just in: John Kerry facing prison,"" said the May 21 headline on Conservative Stories , a website that supports President Donald Trump. The website copied the story about Kerry from the Any Politics website .
""SHARE this story if you think John Kerry should be LOCKED UP!"" the story said.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
Republican operatives have claimed that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris just days after Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the international accord. Trump had promised during the campaign to renegotiate the deal.
As their supposed proof, operatives have pointed to a May 12 tweet of a photo by a lobbyist with the firm Turnberry Solutions that appeared to show Kerry walking near the trendy L’Avenue restaurant in the French capital’s Champs-Elysées neighborhood.
""So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?"" Jason Osborne tweeted , referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act that requires Americans to disclose activities taken on behalf of foreign governments.
No Iranians were in the photo. But people produced other photos of Iranians, reportedly in Paris. An Iranian dissident named M. Hanif Jazayeri identified the photographed Iranians as former Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi and Iran's Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi. To be clear, none of the photos showed Kerry and the Iranians together.
The tweet followed reports about Kerry’s unsuccessful 11th hour bid to preserve a deal he played an instrumental role in crafting.
Kerry was in Paris at the time his photo was allegedly taken, his office has told PolitiFact. But his team denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place.
What does this have to do with Kerry ""facing prison""?
Trump and right-wing backers challenged Kerry’s actions as violating the 18th century Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to undermine U.S. foreign policy. The law says that the punishment for violating the act is a fine or imprisonment of not more than three years, or both.
But the Conservative Stories website, which has no contact information, provided no actual evidence that Kerry was found in violation of the act and faces prison.
Two University of Chicago Law professors, Daniel J. Hemel , and Eric A. Posner , wrote in the Lawfare blog in December that there are only two known instances in which individuals have been indicted for violating the Logan Act, the last of which came in 1853, and neither indictment resulted in conviction.
The story said Kerry was caught ""blatantly commiting treason."" But again, the story provides no evidence beyond the photos. Treason is defined in the U.S. Constitution as consisting ""only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" Treason trials are rare in the U.S.
So, to recap:
Whether Kerry and the Iranians met is contended. As such;
There is no evidence Kerry violated the Logan Act. And even if he did;
Nobody has been convicted of violating the Logan Act, ever.",0,Conservative Stories
"""An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."" In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out ""the evangelical and religious community"" for their assistance in getting him nominated.
""They have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits,"" he said.
""An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away,"" Trump said. ""I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.""
We were curious about the issue and whether an amendment — constitutional or otherwise — prevents the practice for religious institutions.
For this fact-check, we're relying largely scholarly articles in the Denver University Law Review , the Case Western Reserve Law Review , Boston College Law Review .
The restriction is actually a law, not an amendment, and it isn't exclusive to religious institutions.
Lyndon Johnson is best known as America's 36th president, the Texan who assumed the office when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Texas politics can be rough, and Johnson knew how to play that game. Therein lies the origin of the ""Johnson amendment.""
The restriction was championed by LBJ in 1954 when Johnson was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty, and defeating Johnson. There was no church involved.
Johnson, then Democratic minority leader, responded by introducing an amendment to Section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. It said, in effect, that if you want to be absolved from paying taxes, you couldn't be involved in partisan politics.
There was no record of any debate around the amendment.
""The logical argument favoring such an amendment is that those corporations qualifying for the section 501(c)(3) tax subsidy should not be permitted to directly or indirectly use that subsidy to support candidates for office,"" said Michael Hone in the Case Western article.
However it was likely, he said, that ""Johnson was motivated by a desire to exact revenge on the foundation he believed supported his opponent and to prevent it and other nonprofit corporations from acting similarly in the future.""
Nonetheless, ""Subsequently it proved to have a profound effect on how thousands of tax-exempt organizations — including churches — dealt with issues relating to political campaigns,"" according to Patrick O'Daniel of the University of Texas School of Law in the Boston College article.
The law says all such organizations ""are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office."" That includes contributions to political campaigns and any form of public statement for or against a candidate or group of candidates.
Violating the restriction could result in the revocation of the organization's tax exempt status and the imposition of taxes.
Nonpartisan, unbiased voter education or similar activities such as church-organized voter registration drives are allowed.
Historically, that hasn't stopped some religious organizations from issuing endorsements anyway.
O'Daniel has a list of examples. To cite two from 2000:
Rev. Jerry Falwell told worshippers at the Genoa Baptist Church in Ohio to ""vote for the Bush of your choice"" and ""We simply have to beat (Al) Gore.""
That same year, a pastor at a Bronx church who supported Hillary Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate at the time, substituted her opponent's name for Satan during a hymn.
""In the face of lackluster opposition by the Internal Revenue Service, the Democrats and Republicans . . . continue to use the literal bully pulpits of the churches to preach to the party faithful,"" O'Daniel wrote.
Nonetheless, the threat of losing tax-exempt status persists as long as the law is in place, and politically-minded religious groups, particularly evangelicals, have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the IRS in the operation of their religion.
In 2008, for example, pastors in 20 states organized to give politically-oriented sermons to protest the law, according to the Pew Research Center .
The GOP platform has picked up that cudgel, calling for the repeal of that portion of the tax law.
The Johnson amendment survived court challenges in 1983, 1990 and 2000, according to Pew .",1,Donald Trump
"""President Reagan did it (raised the debt ceiling) 18 times.  George W. Bush did it seven times."" In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama made his pitch for a ""balanced"" approach to reducing the deficit -- one that includes spending cuts as well as revenue increases from tax increases for wealthier Americans.
With the debt ceiling issue caught in a political deadlock over how to reduce the deficit, Obama noted that raising the debt ceiling has been a relatively routine exercise for decades.
""Understand –- raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money,"" Obama said. ""It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up. In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.  Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it. President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times. And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we won’t be able to pay all of our bills.""
Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey last week looked at a similar claim, that every president has raised the debt ceiling . They found that was Mostly True. Only President Harry S. Truman did not.
Here, we are looking at Obama's claim that, ""President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times.""
We'll go straight to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which keeps tabs on when the debt ceiling has been raised.
Among its historical tables is one labeled ""Statutory Limits on Federal debt 1940 - Current"" ( Table 7.3 ) The table lists 106 increases to the federal debt limit since 1940.
More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987. In other words, there were 18 under President Ronald Reagan, as Obama said. And there were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 -- during George W. Bush's presidency. We should also note that it has been raised three times already under President Obama, on Feb. 17, 2009, Dec. 28, 2009 and Feb. 12, 2010.
We would be remiss if we failed to note that Obama opposed one of those increases to the debt ceiling under George W. Bush and criticized Bush for a lack of leadership.
""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills,"" Obama said before a March 16, 2006, vote on raising the debt limit. The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed .
In an April 15, 2011, interview, Obama said he regrets his position in 2006.
""I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president,"" Obama said. ""When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit -- for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it.""
We rated that position a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter.
Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support.
Nonetheless, Obama is correct that raising the debt ceiling has been an issue repeatedly tackled by Republicans and Democrats alike. President Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times and George W. Bush did it seven times.",1,Barack Obama
"""Many of the countries in question (in Trump’s travel ban) don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet."" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said judges who have ruled against President Donald Trump’s executive order suspending immigration of nationals from some Muslim-majority nations are ""dead wrong"" to call the directive a ""Muslim ban.""
The issue is that there is ""very little ability"" to verify and vet the people coming from the countries listed in Trump’s directive, Kelly said, adding that most of the countries have no passports, no police and no intelligence on its people.
""Many of the countries in question don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet,"" Kelly told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on May 28.
Trump’s revised, March 6 order — currently blocked by courts — aimed to temporarily suspend entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Is it true that there is no U.S. embassy in many of those countries? Information from the State Department shows there isn’t an embassy in at least four of those six.

David Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred us to information posted on the State Department’s website regarding countries with limited or no U.S. visa services . U.S. embassies and consulates sometimes limit or suspend their visa services for reasons that include natural disasters, civil unrest, war and security concerns, the State Department said.
Iran
The State Department website said the United States does not have diplomatic relationships with Iran, therefore no U.S. embassy or consulate in that country. Other countries listed as having no diplomatic relationship were Bhutan and North Korea.
Libya
The State Department’s website said that on July 26, 2014, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, Libya, ""went on ordered departure and staff temporarily departed due to the ongoing fighting around our embassy and the serious risks faced by our diplomatic personnel.""
The ambassador to Libya and a core group of personnel work from the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia.
Since visa services are unavailable in Libya, the State Department designated the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca, Morocco, ""as the processing post"" for visa applications from Libyan immigrants.
Syria
The U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria, suspended its operations in February 2012 . U.S. citizens in need of emergency assistance are to contact the embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus, which acts as a protecting power for U.S. citizens.
U.S. passports or visas are not issued in Syria .
Somalia
The United States does not have an embassy or diplomatic presence in Somalia. It has a mission to Somalia that operates out of Nairobi, Kenya.
Embassies in Sudan, Yemen, Iraq
The United States does have an embassy in Khartoum, Sudan.
It also has an embassy in Sana’a, Yemen , but out of political and security concerns has reduced its staffing to ""minimal levels."" The embassy has also suspended its consular services, the State Department said. The U.S. embassy in Cairo, Egypt processes visas for Yemeni citizens.
Trump’s first executive order included Iraq, but the country was left out in the revised order. The United States does have an embassy in Iraq’s capital , Baghdad.
Having an embassy helps in the vetting process because that's where the State Department can do most of its questioning, said Bill Hing, an immigration expert and law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law.
Though refugees from areas of conflict are also often vetted at U.S. embassies in other countries, Hing said.",1,John Kelly
"""I'm proud of the fact that I've raised more money from small donors than anybody else, and that we're getting $25, $50, $100 donations, and we've done very well doing it that way."" Barack Obama said in a debate that he has raised the most money from small donors.
For this question, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.
The center found that, based on available data, Obama has raised the most money from small donors, said spokesman Massie Ritsch.
Small donors are defined as people who donate less than $200; the Federal Election Commission requires candidates to itemize contributions from people who give more than that. Smaller donations get reported as a lump sum, and Obama has reported the most money raised under this category. (The donation limit for any individual donor is $2,300 per candidate.)
An important caveat: The center has only analyzed data compiled through Sept. 30, 2007, the last deadline for campaign finance data. Another report is due about two weeks from this writing, on Jan. 31, 2008. It's possible, though not likely, that fundraising during the last quarter of the year could change this analysis.
Here are the totals for individual donors calculated by the center so far, excluding PAC contributions and transfers from other accounts:
* Obama: $79.2-million total, $19.8-million small;
* Clinton: $79.6-million total, $10.4-million small;
* Edwards $30.1-million total, $8.4-million small.",1,Barack Obama
"""New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017"" Springtime in New Hampshire means motorcyclists are itching to hit the state’s scenic, winding roads. But if they trusted a widely distributed news article last year, they might think they need to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph – per a federal government regulation – before they can ride.
Since the Granite State has the second-highest motorcycle ownership rate nationwide – one bike for every 17 people – a mechanical requirement imposed by the federal Department of Transportation would hit the state especially hard.
An estimated $35 price tag for the speed governors would cost New Hampshire’s motorcycle riders more than $2.5 million to bring all 73,000 bikes registered statewide into compliance. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 8 million-plus motorcycles across the United States into compliance, based on the article published by Associated Media Coverage.
Despite the alarm, there was never any such rule proposed, much less mandated.
The apparent news story with the headline """"New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017,"" wasn’t true. There was no requirement to install speed governors, and the article’s lone quoted source, James Littleton, a purported representative of the DOT, doesn’t appear to exist.
Nevertheless, it reached nearly 10,000 people – perhaps more though social media – within a matter of days, according to a cached version of the article, which was subsequently removed. Maybe those readers – 5,500 of whom clicked the like button on the Associated Media Coverage website – should have slowed down.
In addition to removing the article, the website Associated Media Coverage appears to have rebranded itself. Its old URL now redirects to a page called The Seattle Tribune. It also adopted a marginally less-confident tagline: its old motto ""News You Can Trust"" is now simply ""Informing the Nation.""
The Seattle Tribune describes itself as ""a news and entertainment satire web publication … Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" It has no association to the 126-year-old newspaper, The Seattle Times.
PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to examine this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.""
The motorcycle claim – and its apparent intent to irritate motorcyclists – is the type of story that made up this fake news outlet’s bread and butter. The hoax-debunking website Snopes, which found the claim to be false , made this comment about the ""fake news"" Associated Media Coverage article:
""The sensational claim was one of several hoaxes recently promulgated by the Associated Media Coverage fake news site, the most popular of which pertained to purported laws that would affect specific subsets of the population (such as motorcyclists or e-cigarette users),"" Snopes wrote.
If its goal was to rile up one of those subsets – and thereby drive clicks to the website – it worked on at least one motorcycling forum , DungBeetleBikers.com. A user called Prickle posted the verbatim article two days after it first appeared July 31, 2016.
An Australian user called Roo promptly responded to the made-up spokesman’s reasoning that the speed limits would promote safety: ""Per capita exposure to road trauma on a motorcycle is always going to be much higher than say that of cage drivers,"" Roo wrote, referring to non-biker motorists as ""cage drivers"" and continuing indignantly, ""So, cages are exempt? That makes sense, dunnit?""
It turns out speed limiters, or governors, are a real thing. You can buy them online for cars, motorcycles and ATVs, but the cost is usually a few hundred dollars, not the ""subsidized cost"" of $35 as the article states.
The article goes on to make a couple of other assertions that are easily disproved.
The first tries to peg the number of annual motorcycle fatalities: ""... each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States.""
Actually, 4,693 motorcyclists died in the U.S. last year, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , which analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.The peak years for motorcycle fatalities in 1980 and 2008 never topped 5,112.
The second assertion is that 73 percent of motorcycle fatalities ""are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.""
Wrong again. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that only 33 percent of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were speeding, according to an analysis by the Insurance Information Institute .
In both cases, the figures cited in the article are nearly double the numbers put forth by authorities.
When Snopes assessed this claim last August, it noted that Associated Media Coverage, unlike the Seattle Tribune, didn’t identify itself as ""fake news"" or a satirical website.
""While many fake news sites include disclaimer notices informing readers that their content is not credible, Associated Media Coverage does not. As such, many of the less ostentatious claims (such as the 75 MPH motorcycle speed governor one) spread on social media amid a targeted audience,"" Snopes wrote.
Bottom line: The only thing bikers need to worry about if they go over 75 mph is a speeding ticket.",0,Bloggers
"""Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care."" The full quote from Sen. Hillary Clinton's speech on her health care plan:
""Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care. Let me repeat that. Here in America, people are dying because they couldn't get the care they needed when they were sick.""
Clinton used the number to dramatize the need for universal coverage.
The number comes from a report called ""Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late,"" produced in 2002 by the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. The National Academy of Science is a private, nonprofit society of scholars. It was granted a charter by Congress in 1863 and has a mandate to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.
The report found that people without health care coverage:
• received less frequent or no use of cancer screening tests;
• received inconsistent care for the management of chronic disease;
• received fewer diagnostic and treatment services for trauma or heart attacks, and had an increased risk of death when in the hospital.
The report concluded that ""excess deaths among uninsured adults ages 25–64, based on a 25 percent higher mortality risk, can be estimated to be in the range of 18,000 each year.""
The report was independently reviewed. Its findings controlled for an individual's health insurance status as an independent variable, ruling out issues of income, for instance.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."" President Donald Trump says that when Michael Flynn joined his campaign, President Barack Obama’s administration had already given him a once-over.
In an April 30 interview on CBS, Trump framed this detail as an inconvenient fact that the media is ignoring in order to prop up their ""phony"" storyline about Trump associates’ ties to Russia.
""In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration,"" he said. ""And when he went to Russia, I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015, and he was on the Obama clearance.""
Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, was ousted from his Trump administration role as national security adviser after it came to light that Flynn had lied about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Now he’s the focus of a tangential controversy, complete with an investigation by the Pentagon’s watchdog , over payments he received from foreign governments, including Russia.
We were interested in Trump’s statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance, especially given that he was forced out of his Obama-era role in 2014.
We found that Trump has it right.
But that doesn’t affect the main allegation against Flynn: that he didn’t properly disclose payments he received from Russia, as required by law and Pentagon policy. Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role.
Flynn’s foreign affairs
Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army, serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for U.S. Central Command, among other posts. Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in April 2012.
Flynn retired from the agency in August 2014; news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style. Since his departure, he has said he was fired for ""calling our enemies radical jihadis.""
In 2015, Flynn received more than $56,000 from three Russian entities — $33,750 from state-backed media outlet RT, $11,250 from an air cargo company, and $11,250 from a cybersecurity firm — according to documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.
In 2016, during the election, Flynn’s consulting firm earned more than $500,000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government. This became public knowledge in March 2017 , when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent.
Several months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014, he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and can’t do as an Army retiree. The letter, which Flynn himself requested, says ""foreign compensation requires advance approval,"" per the Constitution’s emoluments clause .
Despite the letter, Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities, according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah.
An April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency ""did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynn’s receipt of money from a foreign source"" nor ""any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source.""
Flynn’s lawyer responded , saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event. But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments.
Here’s how Trump’s claim about Flynn’s security clearances fits in.
Retired military officials can keep their security clearances, with periodic background checks. Flynn’s last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration, in June 2010 and January 2016, according to the April 7 DIA letter.
Cummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didn’t report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application. (The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynn’s completed form, but the pages haven’t been made public.)
The security clearance application asks extensively about applicants’ foreign contacts, activities, business and travel. The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison.
The evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance . Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings, the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicant’s judgment or loyalty to the United States, said Andrew Kent, a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser.
Democrats, like Cummings and Obama-era National Security Adviser Susan Rice , have said Spicer’s critique is unfair. They said Flynn’s security clearance re-evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House, and besides, Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself.
Kent said that if those evaluating Flynn’s 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities, they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more details. Because Flynn’s relationship with RT was public knowledge months before Trump was putting his White House team together, the transition team was ""in a different position than the security clearance investigators.""",1,Donald Trump
"John McCain's health care plan ""won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care."" The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has launched an attack ad on John McCain that makes a case that his health care plan hurts women.
The ad features a nurse, Shaina Klackle, talking about a study created by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
""As a nurse, I'm concerned about your health care,"" Klackle says. ""And so is Planned Parenthood's Action Fund. In fact, their study found John McCain's plan won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care.""
The ad goes on to make other claims about McCain's health plan, but here we wanted to look at the claim about guaranteed coverage for cancer screenings and maternity care.
We should say off the bat that McCain's health plan contains no details about specific conditions or coverage. The heart of his plan seeks to stimulate the market for individual health insurance by ending the tax exemption on employer-provided health care benefits in exchange for a tax credit. McCain hopes this will lead to greater competition in the health care market by allowing people to shop around for their own insurance. Also along those lines, his plan calls for allowing people to shop for policies across state lines, so they can purchase the most effective policy, no matter where the insurance provider is located.
It's that last provision that is the basis for Planned Parenthood's statement, according to the report they issued to back up the ad. Many states have passed laws that say health care providers operating in their state must provide coverage in certain areas. Planned Parenthood cites requirements for cancer screenings and maternity care in more than 20 states. Under a McCain plan, insurers could operate in any state and sell all over the country.
A rollback of insurance requirements isn't spelled out in McCain's plan. But it's a reasonable fear, said Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan policy group that seeks to improve the health care system.
Health insurance requirements differ substantially from state to state, and insurance companies would likely locate in the states with the least regulations, Collins said.
""Ultimately, you would have an individual market that's not regulated in any state,"" Collins said. ""It's very different from what we have right now.""
Planned Parenthood's ad says that McCain's plan doesn't ""guarantee"" coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care, and on a literal level, that's true. But Planned Parenthood's deeper point is that some people have a ""guarantee"" under their respective state's current laws, and they could lose that guarantee under McCain's plan. McCain's plan has no literal guarantees for coverage, and Planned Parenthood makes an additional case that his regulations could undermine existing state guarantees.",1,Planned Parenthood
"""The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons, including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 'shoe bomber,' the 'Unabomber,' and many others."" Republicans have been complaining for several weeks that President Barack Obama's plan to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would force the government to bring dangerous terrorists to prisons in the United States. They've even introduced a bill that would put restrictions on the transfers called the ""Keep Terrorists Out of America Act.""
In response to the criticism, Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the assistant majority leader, declared on the Senate floor May 20, 2009, ""The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons, including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 'shoe bomber,' the 'Unabomber,' and many others.""
We started by doing a little digging at the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Indeed, Richard Reid — a.k.a. the ""shoe bomber"" — is being held at the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., which, according to the bureau's Web site, ""houses offenders requiring the tightest controls."" It is the only one of its kind in the United States.
The Florence facility houses several other people that Durbin mentioned and characterized as terrorists: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the ""mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,"" and Ted Kaczynski, the ""Unabomber"" who killed three people and injured 28 others in a string of bombings over the span of 18 years. So Durbin is right about them.
Others convicted of terrorist crimes are housed in the same federal prison, including Wadih El-Hage, Osama bin Laden's former secretary, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his role in the 9/11 attacks.
All told, the federal prisons hold 347 people convicted of international or domestic terrorism, according to Durbin's office, citing Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics.
The Florence location is where the most violent prisoners — and those most likely to escape — end up. Living conditions are sparse; inmates are housed in 86-square-foot cells and have limited contact with other people.
Democrats such as Durbin say facilities like the one in Florence are well-suited for detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
""Some of my Republican colleagues argued that Guantanamo is the only appropriate place to hold the detainees because 'we don’t have a facility that could handle this in the United States' and American corrections officers would 'have no idea what they are getting into,'"" Durbin said. ""They ought to take a look at some of our secured facilities in the United States and they ought to have a little more respect for the men and women who are corrections officers.""
As for Durbin's claim, it appears he did his homework.",1,Richard Durbin
"The budget for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ""is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees."" During a contentious hearing on May 24, 2011, members of a congressional oversight subcommittee sparred with Elizabeth Warren, who is President Barack Obama’s pick to head a new federal agency charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in the financial services sector.
The hearing attracted media attention for a testy exchange between the subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and Warren, who has become a champion of those who want to see stricter oversight of Wall Street. Her official appointment as director has been blocked by Republicans, who want to see changes in how the new agency operates, though she has been working to get the agency up and running as assistant to the president and special adviser to the Treasury Secretary .
A reader pointed us to one statistic presented at the hearing that purported to show the imbalance between federal regulators and Wall Street.
Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the full oversight panel, said that the new agency’s ""budget is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees. … I have to ask you: How in the world will you be able to compete against this Goliath when you are so mismatched?""
We wondered whether there was such an imbalance.
We were able to track down sources for both types of fees. R.K. Hammer , a privately held bankcard consulting firm, tracks credit card penalty fees. The firm found that card penalty fees assessed by the industry during 2010 totaled $22.5 billion.
We should note that the figure we’re using from R.K. Hammer -- what the firm calls ""penalty fees"" -- is an umbrella category that includes various types of fees. However, the firm says that late fees -- the category specifically cited by Cummings -- account for more than 90 percent of penalty fees. So we’ll reduce the amount slightly, to an estimated $20.3 billion in late fees.
Meanwhile, the economic research firm Moebs Services tracks data on overdraft fees. The firm projected that for 2010, overdraft fees will total $35.4 billion.
If you add these two figures, the total is $55.7 billion. To make sure we weren’t double-counting, we checked with both firms, and they confirmed that the two estimates do not overlap.
What about the agency’s budget? We turned to the agency’s website for the answer. Budget documents posted there say that the agency’s estimated budget for fiscal year 2011 is $142.8 million, a number that Obama wants to increase to $329 million in fiscal year 2012.
Using the 2011 figure, the agency’s budget is three-tenths of 1 percent of the industry fee totals. Using the larger figure for 2012 -- which is only a proposal -- it works out to six-tenths of 1 percent.
Both figures are well under the 1 percent threshold Cummings cited. And the fees in Cummings’ comparison are just a small slice of the resources available to financial institutions. According to the Department of Commerce, profits in the finance and insurance sector for 2010 -- not revenues, just profits -- amounted to $366.8 billion .
We’ll note here that we're not ruling on whether a budget that’s equal to 1 percent of penalty and overdraft fees is too little (or too much) to carry out the agency’s tasks. But on the specific comparison Cummings made, we found that he was accurate and even understated the disparity slightly. He’s correct that the new agency’s budget is ""only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees.",1,Elijah Cummings
"""We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression."" Shortly after the Trump administration said it would slap tariffs on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., released a tersely worded statement on the looming ""trade war.""
""This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression,""
Sasse's statement said. "" 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.' ""
Does Sasse have his history right when he says, ""We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression""? He does, as we’ve recounted previously .
The Smoot-Hawley tariffs
If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found.
In a career-making scene , Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.)
Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here ):
""In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.""
Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse.
Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 — sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. — raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street’s ""Black Tuesday"" on Oct. 29, 1929.
The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own.
Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is quite accurate.
Expert opinions
Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was ""no real reason"" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for ""domestic political reasons."" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists.
""Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression,"" Irwin said, but he added that it’s fair to say it made the depression ""longer and more painful.""
After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports.
""Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,"" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that ""if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time.""
Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office.
As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan.
This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression.
""Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,"" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century.
For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade.
Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said.
""It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,"" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. ""However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression.""",1,Ben Sasse
"Says Donald Trump ""wants to undo marriage equality."" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in a campaign speech of wanting to reverse the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage.
During a Nov. 2, 2016, rally in Las Vegas , Clinton gave a laundry list of ideals she said Donald Trump opposed, including equal rights for LGBTQ members.
""If you care about LGBT rights, he wants to undo marriage equality,"" she said of the Republican presidential candidate. She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz.
Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he’s said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law.
‘I am for traditional marriage’
The first indication of Trump’s feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in The Advocate in 2000 , when Trump was allegedly considering running for president.
""I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John’s 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his now-defunct Trump University blog , however.)
More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he was against marriage equality.
""I just don't feel good about it,"" Trump said. ""I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage.""
Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: ""I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman,"" he told MSNBC in 2013 .
Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn’t support marriage equality.
After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26, Trump tweeted , ""Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!""
Two days later, Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper on CNN that he was ""just for traditional marriage.""
Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage would not be a realistic approach .
But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.
""We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state's right issue,"" he told CBN News . He also said he considered the ruling the law now.
He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court’s 5-4 decision.
""If I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,"" Trump said. ""They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don't like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state — it should be a states' rights issue. And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it.""
Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would ""try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage.""
""I could strongly consider that, yes,"" Trump said.
His position didn’t change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn’t strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s opposition to the ruling.
""I would certainly have rather left it to the states,"" Trump said. ""I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that.""
Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump's campaign didn't respond to our request for comment, and Clinton's spokesman didn't add any further comment. His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn’t find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates.
When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summer’s Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of ""the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage,"" Trump’s influence was downplayed.
Trump ""has not really tried to weigh in on the platform,"" Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, told NPR in July .",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating: ""We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen."" Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner perhaps destined to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, has a prolific social media presence. The politician regularly posts memes, photos and his reactions to daily news, at times critical of reporting and often without attribution. His ""Miller for Texas"" Facebook fan page has more than 330,000 likes.
On Nov. 27, 2016, Miller posted a fresh unattributed photo , this time of the muscled actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, shown wearing a T-shirt with a message Miller endorsed. Johnson’s shirt read: ""We stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen,"" along with this Miller caption: ""Thanks to Dewayne Johnson AKA ""The Rock"" for standing up and defending our flag. There are a few good guys left in Hollywood and The Rock is one of them.""
As of early December 2016, Miller’s Johnson post had drawn 3,500 reactions, 1,092 shares and 111 comments, all supportive, some praising Johnson for being a ""stand up guy"" who’s ""not ashamed to admit"" his love for country, or telling Johnson ""he is The Rock for a reason.""
Is photo real?
But when we saw the photo presentation, it looked to us like the unsourced photo’s shirt text had alignment problems. Also, the text on the T-shirt looked skewed and a smudge next to Johnson’s right arm looked as if there might have been additional removed text or imagery.
We knew too that Miller had previously posted a photo lacking accuracy. In March 2016, we found ""Pants on Fire"" what turned out to be Miller’s Facebook post of a fake image of Barack Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara’s face on it. Separately, the Texas Tribune in December 2016 compiled what its story described as 10 Miller posts of ""demonstrably false, misleading or unsupported information.""
A reverse image search
We started our review of the Johnson photo posted by Miller by conducting a reverse Google image search of it. Such a search enables anyone to pull up similar images across the web, demonstrating if other versions have been posted in digital spaces. If multiple versions of a photo exist online, a reverse Google image search can show some of the different iterations.
What came back from our search: The same T-shirt and Johnson pose with other slogans displayed, such as ""Only elephants should wear ivory"" or ""Still here, still strong, Native Pride.""
Additional results showed Johnson standing in a blank V-neck T-shirt, without any text. And among those, one photo came from the cover of the August 2013 issue of Essence Magazine; that photo shows Johnson wearing a similarly fitting navy blue V-neck T-shirt , without any text on the shirt. Then again, Johnson holds a different pose and presents a different facial expression.
Other results--on websites such as Pinterest and Mid-day.com , an Indian news and lifestyle website--showed what looked to us like a blank T-shirt version of the Miller-posted photo.
Miller spokesman calls inquiry 'silly'
So, what gives?
We turned to a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, to find out where Miller picked up his Facebook-posted photo. Smith said he personally ""had no clue"" and said ours was a ""silly, silly inquiry."" He said the message of the T-shirt is what counts. When asked what his comment would be if the photo itself was fake, he said he hadn’t heard complaints from Johnson.
Johnson representative says Miller photo 'photoshopped'
Next, we endeavored to reach someone familiar with Johnson’s photo history. After calling Johnson’s public relations team, we heard from Britt Johnson with the Garcia Companies, who identifies herself as a social media spokesperson for Johnson.
Britt Johnson said by email: ""While I can't recall where that photo was taken, I can say with confidence that the image/shirt"" shared by Miller ""was photoshopped.""
Forensic photography expert
Separately, a web search led us to a forensic photography expert at the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute at Syracuse University. By email, Cathryn Lahm responded that what she looked at after downloading a copy of the photo we’d shared from Miller’s Facebook post and viewing the photo in her software program, ""the T-shirt The Rock is wearing is most likely ‘plain’ and the graphics were placed on the photo -- made to look -- like it was actually on his shirt,"" referring to the pro-flag message. She said the artist likely applied the graphic design onto an existing image, so Johnson would look like he was wearing the presented T-shirt.
""The original image was shot at some press event -- I think -- based on the ‘hot flash shadows’ as if he is walking the red carpet for some opening of a movie or an event,"" Lahm said. If she ""had to go to court"" about the authenticity of the Miller-posted photo, Lahm said, she would call the image a fake.",0,Sid Miller
"Then-Sen. Barack Obama ""refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership."" Michele Bachmann said she would not support increasing the debt ceiling if it didn't include major reductions in government spending.
""I've already voted no on raising the debt ceiling in the past. And unless there are serious cuts, I can't,"" she said at debate June 13, 2011, in New Hampshire. Bachmann is seeking the 2012 Republican nomination for president.
""But I want to speak to someone that's far more eloquent than I,"" she continued. ""Someone who said just dealing with the issue of raising the debt ceiling is a failure of leadership. That person was then Senator Barack Obama. He refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership.""
We decided to fact-check Bachmann's to see if she was right.
We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the U.S. Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged.
The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but said it needs to be raised by August for the government to keep up with its obligations.
Experts have warned that failure to raise the limit could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets, but Republicans have vowed to oppose the increase unless it's accompanied by spending cuts. Closed-door negotiations, led by Vice President Joe Biden, have been ongoing.
The votes to raise the debt ceiling -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing. Our research showed that President Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush.
""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills,"" Obama said.
""Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next five years,"" he said, adding,""Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.""
The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed .
Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support.
We asked the Obama re-election campaign for comment on this but we didn't hear back. Obama was asked directly about his vote on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange:
""You've got to extend the debt limit,"" Stephanopolous said. ""And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?""
""I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president,"" Obama replied. ""When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it.""
Bachmann said Obama refused to approve an increase in the debt limit when he was a senator, and that he blamed President Bush for failed leadership, as well as Bush's supporters in Congress.",1,Michele Bachmann
"""About three-quarters of (Syrian refugees) are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old."" Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., pushed back on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to indefinitely suspend admission of Syrian refugees, calling it a Muslim ban and arguing that the order affects many women and children.
""When you try to ban refugees, these folks go through an 18-to-24-month vetting as it is,"" Ellison said Jan. 29 on CBS’ Face the Nation. ""The fact is, is that Syrian -- if you talk about banning Syrians, about three-quarters of those folks are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old.""
Ellison, who is vying to lead the Democratic National Committee, accurately cited data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
We previously explored the demographic makeup of Syrian refugees when Trump, as a candidate, made false claims that most Syrian refugees were actually strong men. (For background on Trump’s immigration executive order, check out our explainer .)
UN’s refugee agency data
There are more than 4.89 million Syrian refugees according to the UN’s latest count .
That total accounts for about 2 million refugees registered by the UNHCR (in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon), 2.8 million registered by the Turkish government and more than 29,000 registered in North Africa.
Ellison referenced a UNHCR regional demographic breakdown based on refugees registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.
To determine a figure for women and children, Ellison summed the percentage of registered Syrian males under 18 years old with the percentage of women of all ages -- it comes out to about 73 percent, according to data last updated Jan. 19 .
Factoring in women of all ages and boys under 12 years old, it's about 66 percent.
Ellison’s other point about ""a full third"" of refugees being younger than 12 years old also checks out for the UNHCR group. About 17 percent relocated to Egypt, Jordan, Iraq or Lebanon are boys and about 16 percent are girls.
We wanted to know if the demographics were similar for the larger pool of 2.8 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. They are.
In Turkey, about 70 percent of registered Syrian refugees are women of all ages and males under 18. About 30 percent are children under 12 years old, according to data last updated Jan. 12 .
Women of all ages and boys under 12 years old represent about 62 percent of the population.
A demographic report for the estimated 29,000 refugees in North Africa (Egypt included in other UNHCR report) was not available.
Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, said there's a large Syrian community in Libya and that it's likely many Syrian refugees there have not been registered.
The flow of Syrians to Libya after 2011 has been much greater than 29,000, Mock said. Syrian refugees have also gone to Tunisia, though the number there is less than 1,000 registered Syrian refugees according to a UNHCR fact sheet, he said.
The United States accepted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) and fewer than 2,000 in fiscal 2015.
Prior to that, the most Syrian refugees the Obama administration had accepted was 105, according to data from the State Department's Refugee Processing Center.
Here's a breakdown of fiscal year 2016 admissions:
- Total: 12,587
- Male: 6,571
- Female: 6,016
- Boys and girls under 14 years old: 6,118 (about 48.61 percent of admissions)",1,Keith Ellison
"In his first TV interview as president, Obama said we ""should talk to Iran."" The only good thing Mitt Romney had to say about President Barack Obama’s foreign policy record was he ""gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden.""
From that point in Romney’s speech accepting the Republican Party presidential nomination, he quickly pivoted to zinging Obama for his policies on Israel, Cuba, Russia, Poland and, possibly worst of all, Iran.
""On another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat,"" Romney said on Aug. 30, 2012. ""In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran’s centrifuges are still spinning.""
Here, we’re fact-checking whether Obama said we should ""talk to Iran"" in his first TV interview.
Obama’s first interview as president came on Jan. 27, 2009, with Hisham Melhem, Washington bureau chief for Al Arabiya. The Dubai-based network is considered less radical than Al Jazeera. News organizations from the New York Times to the Washington Post to MSNBC billed it as his first formal TV interview in the White House.
Obama, who pledged a much different approach with the Middle East than his predecessor, was coming off selecting former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East. He made calls on his first day in the Oval Office to Arab and Israeli leaders, we’ve noted in a previous fact-check .
""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy,"" the network quoted Obama as saying.
The question about Iran’s nuclear status was the last one in the interview. Obama stressed diplomacy while frowning on Iran’s threats against Israel and its pursuit of a nuclear weapon that ""could potentially set off an arms race in the region.""
Here is the full exchange, pulled from Al Arabiya’s 2009 story :
Melhem: Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in the direction of preventing it?
Obama: You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran.
Now, the Iranian people are a great people, and Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region: their threats against Israel; their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off an arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been helpful.
But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will over the next several months be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.
Again, we’re not evaluating in this fact-check whether Obama’s policies on Iran have worked to slow Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.
But Obama said in his first presidential interview that we should ""be willing to talk to Iran."" Romney’s characterization of that interview is very close.",1,Mitt Romney
"""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight."" An article sounding alarm bells about ""Islamic Extremism"" and migrants said that a new law designed to combat terrorism in the Czech Republic allows citizens to carry guns.
""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight,"" said an April 27 headline on patriotnetwork.one , a website that posts multiple anti-Muslim articles.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.
The story celebrated what it described as a new gun policy in the Czech Republic.
""Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation,"" patriotnetwork.one wrote.
While the story said that this is ""breaking"" news, it actually refers to news developments several months ago. In fact, the same story appeared on multiple websites and Facebook in June 2017.
While patriotnetwork.one portrayed the law as a done deal, it was only approved by one chamber of the government and so has not actually become law.
Gun proposal passed one chamber in Czech Republic government
In 2015, Czech president Milos Zeman called for an international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group.
Speaking at a Holocaust commemoration forum in Prague, Zeman said such military action would prevent what he called a ""super Holocaust,"" in which hundreds of millions would die.
Zeman said in 2016 interview that Czechs should obtain guns to protect themselves against terrorists.
''If it is necessary, people will have to be ready for a situation where they will have to use those guns,'' he said. ''My wife has just got a gun license and has a proper revolver. So I hope she will protect me from terrorists.''
In June 2017, the lower chamber passed an amendment to the constitution related to the carrying of firearms.
Kieran Williams, an expert in the politics of Central and Eastern Europe at Drake University, told PolitiFact that the measure would have amended a 1998 act in order to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. The original act made it a duty to help if called upon by the state.
""Czechs have long had statutory rights to keep and bear arms, and to use force in self-defense,"" he said. ""This constitutional bill was a response to a European Union directive to tighten up possession of certain categories of weapons after the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere; gun advocates hoped to minimize the impact of that directive on the Czech Republic by creating this new constitutional right.""
The amendment passed the lower chamber in June . But it was rejected by the Senate in December when it fell short of the needed three-fifths majority. (Our Czech fact-checking friends at demagog.cz pointed us to the Senate vote .)
Patriotnetwork.one makes no direct mention of the Senate, although it drew some information from a 2017 Sputniknews article that did mention that the bill still had to be approved by the Senate. The Patriotnetwork.one story is about the Czech Republic, but one of the photos the website used of an angry man appears to be the same as a 2015 photo of a man in a Budapest railway station .
Few Muslims and European migrants in Czech Republic
The patriotnetwork.one website tries to stir up fear about Muslims, migrants and terrorism in the Czech Republic while ignoring some facts.
For starters, the Muslim population in the country of more than 10 million is tiny. The Muslim population was less than 4,000 in the 2011 census, but participants weren’t required to fill out information about their religion. That could be an undercount, but even other estimates aren’t much higher at 22,000 .
The Czech Republic has taken very few migrants in recent years and ""has no recent history of terrorism and generally has a declining rate of violent crime,"" WIlliams said.
Sean Hanley, a senior lecturer at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London, said most migrants entering the Czech Republic wanted to access the country to get to other countries such as Germany.
There were only 1,525 requests for asylum in the Czech Republic in 2015 and at the peak of the 2014-15 crisis around 1,500 migrants were detained by the Czech authorities for entering the country illegally.  Very small numbers of migrants and refugees entered compared with Hungary or Croatia.
""This is an entirely unrealistic ‘threat’ but it taps into and gives a focus to the fears and insecurities of small, mono-ethnic post-communist country in an uncertain world,"" he said.
Hanley said it ""was one of the more bizarre legislative initiatives in the political history of the Czech Republic"" and occurred amid a backdrop of anti-refugee hysteria .",0,Patriotnetwork.one
"""When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating."" The 2016 presidential race may come down to a contest where the least unpopular candidate wins, with Democrat Hillary Clinton just three percentage points ahead of Republican Donald Trump in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll .
Both candidates have extraordinarily high disapproval ratings, a fact mentioned by Chuck Todd when he interviewed Clinton during the May 22 edition of Meet the Press. He wanted to know how she would get past her negative numbers.
Clinton argued that once she gets on a job, whether it's first lady, U.S. senator or secretary of state, she gets things done.
""So I have a track record. And I'm going to remind people of that. Because it's not just rhetoric, for me,"" she said. ""When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating, as you can go back and check. Because I was doing a job that people could see.""
The latest NBC News poll shows that 54 percent of registered voters have a negative or somewhat negative opinion of Clinton. Trump scores a bit worse at 58 percent. Only 34 percent view Clinton positively. We wondered if her rating was really very high when she served as secretary of state from January 2009 through Feb. 1, 2013.
Clinton's favorability rating has ebbed and flowed during her two and a half decades on the national political scene. Gallup pegged it as low as 38 percent when her husband ran for president in 1992, but the polling firm has said that's because she was wasn't well known.
It peaked at 62 percent during her first years as first lady, dropped to 43 percent in 1996 during the ""Travelgate"" investigation, and spiked to its highest point ever — 67 percent — in December 1998 when her husband was impeached for perjury in the wake of scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones. By the time she left the White House in 2001, Clinton's Gallup rating was down to 44 percent.
Her polling numbers started going up during her time in the Senate and hit another peak of 58 percent in 2007 while a senator and just after announcing she would run for president, according to Gallup.
After another dip, it shot up to 65 percent in 2009 when she became secretary of state and stayed high for most of her tenure.
In two polls taken in 2011 and 2012, she was viewed favorably by 66 percent, making her more popular than President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.
When she left that position on Feb. 1, 2013, 64 percent had a favorable view of her. Her rating has since declined in the wake of criticism over security at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and controversy over how she handled her emails .
Clinton's campaign pointed us to other polling data. A Washington Post-ABC News poll put her favorability at 67 percent as she was winding down as secretary of state and preparing to testify in a Benghazi hearing. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted at the same time put her approval rating at 69 percent.
Are these percentages ""very high,"" as Clinton characterized them on Meet the Press?
To get some perspective on how easy it is to get an approval rating that high, we consulted Gallup's Presidential Job Approval Center which goes back to Harry Truman and lists overall favorability ratings, along with highs and lows. In this context, Clinton’s highest numbers were relatively strong.
Of the dozen presidents, the six with the highest overall averages are:
John Kennedy (average: 70.1; range: 56 to 83)
Dwight Eisenhower (average: 65 percent; range: 48 to 79)
George H. W. Bush (average: 60.9 percent; range: 29 to 89)
Lyndon Johnson (average: 55.1 percent; range: 35 to 79)
Bill Clinton (average: 55.1 percent; range: 37 to 73)
Ronald Reagan (average: 52.8 percent; range: 35 to 68)
Clinton also polls well compared to recent secretary of states, according to Gallup . Condoleezza Rice's scores ranged from 59 percent to 63 percent during the George W. Bush administration. But neither comes close to Colin Powell, whose ratings ranged from 83 percent to 88 percent.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""We lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined."" During the April 3, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, columnist George Will said during the show’s roundtable segment that ""we lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined.""
We knew the most recent recession was bad, but we hadn’t realized it was so bad in comparison to other recent recessions. So we decided to check whether Will was right.
We turned to two sources. One is the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group of economists that is the de facto arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The other is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates all manner of employment figures.
Below we list the last five recessions as declared by the NBER , along with the difference in U.S. non-farm employment levels between the official start of the recession and the official end:
Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 968,000 jobs lost
July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 2,824,000 jobs lost
July 1990 to March 1991: 1,249,000 jobs lost
March 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1,599,000 jobs lost
Total jobs lost in the four prior recessions: 6,640,000
""Great Recession"" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: 7,490,000 jobs lost
So the numbers show that Will is right -- about 850,000 more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined.
We wondered, though, whether the result would be different if we factored in the size of the labor force, which has grown over the past three decades. It’s impossible to make the same exact comparison Will did -- that is, comparing the sum of the past four recessions with the current one -- because you can’t simply add together percentages drawn from different time periods. But we thought we’d at least see whether the 2007-2009 recession registered more jobs lost on a percentage basis than any of the prior ones.
Here are the numbers for jobs lost as a percentage of the labor force:
Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 1.0 percent
July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 3.1 percent
July 1990 to March 1991: 1.1 percent
March 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1.2 percent
""Great Recession"" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: Recession decreased jobs by 5.4 percent
So job losses in the ""Great Recession"" have, on a percentage basis, exceeded those in each of the past four recessions.",1,George Will
"""One in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared over the weekend that he was running for the Republican nomination for president. In his announcement speech , he said that if elected, he would rein in the federal government just as he's pursued policies of lower taxes, less spending and less regulation in the state of Texas.
Those policies, he said, have resulted in strong job growth .
No, they didn't, replied Paul Krugman, the liberal New York Times columnist. Krugman wrote in his column that simple population growth, among other things, has fueled new jobs in Texas. Meanwhile, Krugman said, unemployment has risen in Texas just like it has in other states.
""In June 2011, the Texas unemployment rate was 8.2 percent. That was less than unemployment in collapsed-bubble states like California and Florida, but it was slightly higher than the unemployment rate in New York, and significantly higher than the rate in Massachusetts. By the way, one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach. Meanwhile, Massachusetts has near-universal coverage thanks to health reform very similar to the 'job-killing' Affordable Care Act.""
Krugman was right on his unemployment numbers -- we checked them with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics .
But we were interested in checking his claim about health insurance, that ""one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach.""
To check this, we turned first to the U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts a regular survey on health insurance status, the Current Population Survey. According to the latest numbers, 26.1 percent of Texans had no insurance in 2009 -- just about equal to the one-in-four number Krugman cited and the highest number among the 50 states. The Census Bureau also averaged its data for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. In that analysis, Texas also ranked first, with 25.5 percent uninsured.
Gallup also conducts polls on whether people have insurance or not, and most recently polled during 2010. For that year, it concluded that 27.8 percent of Texans lack health insurance, which comes to nearly 3 in 10. That too made it the state with the highest uninsured rate in the country.
Krugman adds the kicker that these numbers are ""thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach,"" suggesting that the conservative philosophies of Perry and other state leaders result in less health coverage.
We asked Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that advocates for low- and middle-income Texans, about the uninsured in Texas. She noted several relevant trends.
• Employment-sponsored health insurance is declining, as it is across the nation. But Texas is 8 to 10 percentage points below average when it comes to workers covered by their employers.
• Enrollment in government plans that insure the poor such as Medicaid, is about the average in Texas, even though poverty rates in Texas are higher.
• Texas generally takes a hands-off approach when it comes to regulating health insurance.
• The income limits for parents to qualify for Medicaid are set extremely low -- $188 per month for a family of three, for example, which excludes many working poor families. (As in most states, healthy adults without children can't qualify for Medicaid at all.)
""We have not done things that other states have done to make health care more affordable and accessible,"" Dunkelberg said.
On the other side of the political spectrum, John C. Goodman of the Texas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, which advocates free market approaches, said Texas uninsurance rates are explained by ethnicity and poverty. ""The state’s population is disproportionately Hispanic and Hispanics tend to have twice the uninsured rate. Also, we have a lot of low-income people in the state,"" he said.
In ruling on Krugman's statement, we're looking at his statement, ""One in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation.",1,Paul Krugman
"If you ""already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" Seeking to jump-start efforts to pass a health care bill, President Barack Obama defended his reform plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress.
He sought to reassure Americans they would not lose their current coverage.
""First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have,"" Obama said. ""Let me repeat this:  Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.""
Obama is correct that the plans under consideration do not force those who currently have insurance to change plans. The proposals seek to build on the current system, where many Americans get coverage through work.
The plans do, however, implement new consumer protections and introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies.
These new rules will surely change the current health care system. The bill in the House of Representatives gives employer-provided insurance five years to come into compliance with new rules, such as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and coverage for preventive care.
Right now, employers have the freedom to change or drop coverage, and they will continue to have that freedom under health reform. Doctors, too, can opt in or out of accepting various insurance plans, including Medicare. Because of this inherent instability to the health care system, and because of the new regulations, we rated one of Obama's earlier statements on the effects of reform — ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan"" — Half True .
Given what we know about reform, it seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when insurers alter their offerings under the new regulations. This would be most likely for any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed to use a national exchange where insurers compete to offer insurance, and prices are expected to be lower.
Obama's statement from the speech is more carefully phrased than his earlier statement. In his speech, he said that if you are ""already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" That is true, there is nothing in the plan that proactively forces these kinds of changes, and the bills clearly intend to leave much of the current health care system in place.",1,Barack Obama
"""John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)."" Sharpening his attack line that electing Sen. John McCain is the equivalent of giving President Bush a third term, Sen. Barack Obama used his triumphant speech in St. Paul, Minn. June 3, 2008, in which he finally claimed the Democratic nomination, to note that his Republican rival voted with the commander-in-chief 95 percent of the time last year.
""It's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year,"" Obama said.
The number Obama cited didn't come out of thin air. It reflects McCain's 2007 ""presidential support"" score from Congressional Quarterly, part of a carefully measured and widely cited series of vote studies that demonstrate how often lawmakers back or oppose the president, as well as the majority of their parties.
But while Obama may be accurately quoting the CQ analysis of 2007, he's selectively picking facts while not telling the entire story.
McCain's 95 percent score was the high-water mark of his presidential support during President Bush's tenure, and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005, and backed the president's position an average of 89 percent of the time since 2001. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep.
The 2007 votes reflected the Senate agenda after Democrats gained a one-vote majority in the chamber in the 2006 mid-term elections. Bush stated a position on 97 roll call votes and won 64 of them — a 66 percent success rate. Deduct the 29 Senate votes to confirm Bush nominees to executive branch positions or judgeships, and the president's success rate fell to just over 51 percent.
But while he had a terrible year on paper, Bush was the winner on critical votes on spending limits, taxes and energy policy, thanks to unified support from Republicans. Because Senate rules require 60 votes to end prolonged debate or a filibuster, Republicans repeatedly used the stalling tactic to stop initiatives on the Democrats' agenda. The Senate voted 18 times last year on motions to cut off debate and end filibusters that Bush was on record as supporting. He prevailed 17 times.
McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as the filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters.
McCain's vote score can thus be viewed both as a reflection of ideological kinship with the Bush administration and with the hard-line, tactical decisions he made in response to some Democratic initiatives. Because Obama correctly quotes an accurate measure of how often McCain was in sync with the president in 2007, we rule the claim True.",1,Barack Obama
"U.S. Sen. John McCain ""was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on (the) USS Forrestal aircraft carrier."" Several websites have dredged up erroneous details of a deadly naval accident to smear U.S. Sen. John McCain’s service record after his vote against a GOP health care bill.
Calling McCain ""a traitor and disgrace to the American People,"" an Aug. 6, 2017, post on WorldNewsCircle.com attacks the Arizona Republican for his role in a 1967 fire on the USS Forrestal during the Vietnam War.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. They also highlighted similar posts on some other sites .
Appearing after McCain derailed GOP efforts on July 28 to pass a bill in the Senate repealing the Affordable Care Act , the article blames the then-U.S. Navy pilot for the blaze.
""McCain train wreck career met an all time low when he was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier,"" the post read. ""The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty.""
The essay said McCain ""decided to practice a reckless maneuver that day called a wet start,"" in which a pilot sends extra fuel to a jet’s thrusters to create a showy flame on takeoff. The post said that wet start ignited an adjacent plane’s missiles, which fired and hit ""multiple planes filled with explosives all through the carrier’s deck.""
(Still more internet posts have been saying McCain dropped his plane’s own bombs on the deck , causing the explosions, or that McCain abandoned the deck prematurely .)
This charge has been leveled against McCain before, as the event did come up during his 2008 presidential campaign . But official reports and other accounts don’t support the assertion that he was responsible.
Fire aboard the Forrestal
McCain was aboard the Forrestal as a lieutenant commander piloting an A-4 Skyhawk for the U.S. Navy on July 29, 1967, the day of the fire. The Forrestal had recently been resupplied with munitions, including 1,000-pound bombs from the Korean War , stored on the deck, because modern bombs were in short supply. McCain’s jet was parked on the deck, tail pointed outward before takeoff, as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Tonkin.
McCain didn’t ""wet start"" his jet, but rather an F-4 Phantom about 100 feet away at the opposite end of the deck accidentally fired a rocket because of an electrical surge.
The details vary depending on the account, but the rocket hit either McCain’s plane or the plane of fellow Skyhawk pilot Lt. Cdr. Fred White.
Our friends at FactCheck.org found that McCain’s own statements immediately after the disaster showed him admitting his memory of the event was muddled.
McCain remembered the rocket hitting his own plane in Chapter 14 of his 1999 book Faith of My Fathers: ""In the next instant, a Zuni missile struck the belly fuel tank of my plane, tearing it open, igniting two hundred gallons of fuel that spilled onto the deck, and knocking two of my bombs to the deck.""
But the official U.S. Navy report of the accident said the rocket hit White’s plane, rupturing the fuel tank and igniting the jet fuel.
A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White, spilling more fuel and igniting it. The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating, but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames. (Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have ""cooked off"" the way the Korean War-era munitions did, contributing to the disaster.)
Gregory Freeman, author of the 2002 book Sailors to the End, has sided with McCain’s account, but conceded on his website that it was entirely possible the rocket hit both Skyhawks .
Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube:
McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames, suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest. He described the conflagration in his book:
""All around me was mayhem. Planes were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship, and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck. Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm. Men trapped by flames jumped overboard. More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck. Explosions tore craters in the flight deck, and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay, spreading the fire below.""
McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds. He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon, but below-deck fires lasted for another 24 hours.
""The fires were consuming the Forrestal. I thought she might sink,"" he wrote. ""But the crew’s heroics kept her afloat. Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship. Many of them were only 18 or 19 years old.""
The Forrestal was drydocked and refit, staying in service until being decommissioned in 1993 . The fire, considered the worst combat-related naval disaster since World War II , led to changes in crew training and flight deck procedures.
McCain transferred to the USS Oriskany, the aircraft carrier from which he took off on Oct. 27, 1967, the day he was shot down over North Vietnam and taken prisoner.",0,Bloggers
"""If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of."" Donald Trump says the United States should kill the family members of terrorists, and not to do so is just being ""politically correct.""
""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends on Dec. 2, 2015. ""They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families.""
Trump got a challenge on this at the CNN presidential debate in Las Vegas. CNN aired a pre-recorded question from Josh Jacob, a student at Georgia Tech: ""Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law.""
Trump doubled down on his position: ""I would be very, very firm with families"" and repeating his sentiment that even though people think ""they may not care much about their lives … they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives.""
Later in the debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took Trump to task for that approach.
""If you are going to kill the families of terrorists,"" Paul said, ""Realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America.""
We wondered whether Paul was right about the Geneva Convention, so we asked a range of experts in international law.
They said Paul was correct and pointed to two key pieces of international agreements.
What the Geneva Convention says about fighting terrorist groups
The Geneva Conventions were designed after World War II to establish agreed-upon rules of war. The United States, like most countries, is a party to them and ""is hugely committed in principle and in the training of soldiers,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor.
All four Geneva Conventions from 1949 contain ""Common Article 3,"" which applies to ""armed conflict not of an international character."" What does that mean? The U.S. Supreme Court, in the 2006 case Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, ruled that ""armed conflict not of an international character"" means a war that is not fought against a sovereign state. (A sovereign state simply means a country with a recognized government.) Since groups like ISIS are not considered sovereign states, that means that Common Article 3 applies to the current war on terrorism.
According to Common Article 3, people who are taking no active part in the hostilities ""shall in all circumstances be treated humanely… To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever … violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture.""
Experts said this language would make Trump’s approach a violation of the Geneva Conventions, assuming that the family members were not taking part in terrorist activities.
Common Article 3 ""would seem to prohibit any targeting of families or others who were ‘taking no active part in hostilities,’ "" said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. ""The principle of noncombatant immunity is a fundamental principle of international law.""
What the Geneva Conventions say about targeting civilians
This extension of the original Geneva Conventions was finalized in 1977.
The most relevant portion for judging the Trump scenario appears to be Article 51.2, which states, ""The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.""
This root principle here is to ensure that civilians are not the object of an attack, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at the Texas Tech University School of Law.
""I believe that a policy of intentionally and directly targeting the families of terrorists, assuming the family members are not combatants themselves, is a gross violation of the law of war and a war crime,"" Rosen said.
Rosen and others acknowledged that there are some gray areas when putting this provision into practice.
For instance, the Geneva Conventions don’t outlaw all civilian casualties when armed forces are undertaking a military objective. It effectively permits them if precautions are taken and the ""expected loss of life or injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects incidental to the attack, is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained,"" Rosen said.
This balance can be difficult to strike, Ratner said, but at least it means that ""you can't kill a huge number of people just to knock out a small target.""
There’s another wrinkle: Officially, the United States is not a party to the Additional Protocols of 1977. However, the United States has blessed them in practice, experts said.
The United States ""has recognized much of (the Additional Protocols) as binding customary law,"" said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a Notre Dame law professor. The Supreme Court ""said as much in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld in 2006. As customary international law, the U.S. cannot ‘pull out’ of the rule. It binds us until a new treaty rule or customary rule supersedes it.""
In addition, Rosen said, the Defense Department Law of War Manual published in June 2015 says that civilians may not be made the object of an attack.
The provisions in the Additional Protocols ""prohibit acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror in a civilian population,"" said David P. Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University. ""Trump's proposal to have U.S. military forces deliberately kill families, including women and children, in order to deter ISIS fighters is a proposal to use acts of violence to spread terror among civilians. Or Trump wants to fight terror with terror, something abhorrent to America's warriors and unconscionable as a suggestion from someone who wants to be commander in chief.""",1,Rand Paul
"Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion. On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.
For this item, we’ll check one of the two claims from the 30-second version -- whether Romney has changed his position on abortion. We'll look at other aspects of the ad in separate items.
Romney, unlike the other GOP contenders, has attracted early attention from the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, largely due to Romney’s status as the nominal frontrunner in the GOP primary. But Romney has faced years of accusations about being a flip-flopper, most recently in a television ad by one of his primary rivals, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.
We checked Huntsman’s abortion-related charges from that ad, so we’ll recap them here.
First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.
•  In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
•  In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""
We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.
What about his views today? The ""issues"" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.
""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.
""I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries.  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.
""I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.""",1,Democratic National Committee
"""The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."" The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to sue President Barack Obama for allegedly overstepping the powers of his office.
While the suit raises thorny legal questions about the limits of presidential power, it’s also being used by both sides to fire up their base in advance of the midterm elections. The suit, spearheaded by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was approved largely along party lines . Democrats argued that it’s an example of the Republican majority playing politics rather than tackling urgent policy issues, such as immigration.
Indeed, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used the looming vote to approve the suit in a recent fundraising pitch, as reported by NBC News .
""Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president,"" Pelosi wrote. ""The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step.""
We wondered whether Pelosi is correct that ""the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history.""
We found that she’s right the House as a whole has never sued the president. However, we think it’s worth noting that individual lawmakers and groups of lawmakers have sued the president in the past -- frequently. In fact, we found at least 14 instances in the last four decades alone.
This doesn’t make Pelosi’s carefully worded claim inaccurate, but it's worth adding important context.
We should note that these challenges to presidential authority generally failed, particularly challenges over whether Congress or the president has the right to initiate military action. Often, the suits’ Achilles heel was the courts’ determination that the lawmakers lacked the ""standing"" -- basically, a demonstrable injury -- to file such a suit. This succession of negative rulings for Congress has presented the plaintiffs against Obama with an uphill legal climb, analysts say .
Here’s a rundown of the 14 lawsuits we found:
• Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities vs. Nixon (1974). This was one of the Watergate-era cases involving what evidence President Richard Nixon had to turn over to investigators that heightened the pressure on Nixon to resign.
• Drummond vs. Bunker (1977). William R. Drummond, a citizen of the Panama Canal Zone, sued President Jimmy Carter to stop his administration from negotiating about handing over the then-U.S.-held canal zone to Panama, arguing that only Congress possessed that right. Six members of Congress intervened in the case alongside Drummond, arguing that the executive branch was depriving them of their constitutionally protected vote.
• Goldwater vs. Carter (1979). Several lawmakers, led by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., sued Carter , arguing that the president had bypassed Congress by ending a defense pact with Taiwan.
• Crockett vs. Reagan (1982). Sixteen senators and 13 House members asked a federal court to rule that the dispatching of several dozen U.S. military personnel to El Salvador by President Ronald Reagan contradicted Congress’s war powers and the Foreign Assistance Act.
• Sanchez-Espinoza vs. Reagan (1983). Twelve House members joined with 12 Nicaraguan citizens and two American citizens seeking damages and a declaration that Reagan had violated war powers restrictions by pursuing the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government.
• Conyers vs. Reagan (1984). Eleven House members sued Reagan, arguing that his use of military force in Grenada had usurped Congress’s war powers.
• Lowry vs. Reagan (1987). Ten House members sued Reagan on war powers grounds, this time over the president’s approval of escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.
• Dellums vs. Bush (1990). One senator and 53 House members sued President George H.W. Bush to stop him from attacking Iraq without approval from Congress during the run-up to what became the Persian Gulf War.
• Raines vs. Byrd (1997). Six members of Congress who had voted against giving the president the authority to veto individual items in bills -- rather than just entire bills -- sued over the act’s constitutionality.
• Chenoweth vs. Clinton (1999). Four House members sued President Bill Clinton over his creation by executive order of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, saying it exceeded his authority as president.
• Campbell vs. Clinton (2000). Thirty-one members of Congress sued Clinton on war powers grounds for his decision to send military forces to participate in a NATO-organized campaign of airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia.
• Kucinich vs. Bush (2002). Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sued President George W. Bush over the administration’s unilateral withdrawal from an anti-ballistic missile treaty, arguing that the executive branch could not do that without Congress’ consent.
• Doe vs. Bush (2003). Twelve House members joined with several dozen servicemembers and their families to sue Bush on war-powers grounds, seeking to stop a United States-led invasion of Iraq.
• Kucinich vs. Obama (2011). Kucinich also sued Bush’s successor, Obama, on war-powers grounds, saying that his intervention in Libya was unconstitutional.
Drew Hammill, a spokesman Pelosi, said her statement is ""accurate"" because ""she is clearly referring to the ‘House of Representatives,’ not individual members of Congress.""
Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Pelosi has some justification for singling out a lawsuit by the whole House. Having a majority of the House on board ""suggests the grievance may be more legitimate,"" Roosevelt said, though he added that this scenario also ""suggests that the House should be able to use the powers the Constitution gives it -- our familiar system of checks and balances -- rather than trying to enlist the judiciary in a political struggle.""
Still, while Pelosi’s claim is literally accurate, legal observers suggested that her careful wording selectively downplays a long history of clashes between the two branches of government.
Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying that Pelosi’s statement is ""technically accurate,"" but ""misleading"" ""Typically, suits are brought against other executive branch officials, rather than the president directly,"" she said.
Stan Brand, a veteran Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the U.S. House under the late Speaker Thomas P. ""Tip"" O'Neill, D-Mass., said, ""It may be that the House as an institution has never sued a president, but undoubtedly there have been cases where challenges to presidential actions have occurred. I am not impressed by the claim that this is the first such suit, because it elevates form over substance. The much more interesting issues for me are the jurisprudential separation-of-powers implications of such litigation.""",1,Nancy Pelosi
"""We've had Muslims in America since George Washington."" A Muslim woman at the second presidential debate asked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton how they would help millions of Muslims in the United States ""deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country.""
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Muslims have to report problems, because ""if they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country."" And Clinton, his Democratic rival, won’t use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" Trump said, which we have said is misleading .
Clinton said she wanted Muslims to feel included in the country, ""part of our homeland security.""
""We've had Muslims in America since George Washington,"" Clinton said. ""And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.""
We wondered about Clinton’s remarks about Muslims being in America since the nation’s first president, more than 200 years ago .
There are about 2.75 million Muslims in America, according to estimates by Pew Research Center. Islam is the second-largest religion in the world after Christianity and the fastest growing.
Muslims were singled out this election cycle when Trump in December 2015 called for a "" total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" until U.S. representatives ""can figure out what is going on.""
Trump’s statement came a few days after a husband and wife in San Bernardino, Calif., fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 others. The woman was from Pakistan and on the day of the attack pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, a terrorist group also known as ISIS.
In June 2016, Trump said he was revising his plan, and would suspend immigration from areas with ""proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.""
After the mass shooting in California and other attacks in Paris , hate crimes against Muslims spiked in the United States, the New York Times reported .
Given statements about banning Muslims from coming to the United States and the attacks some already in the country are facing, Clinton’s comment about their presence in the country dating back hundreds of years seemed relevant.
Muslim slaves
Clinton’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 9, 2015, opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter Manseau, who has written about American history and religions.
""No matter how anxious people may be about Islam, the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority-Christian country has no basis in fact,"" Manseau’s New York Times piece said . ""Moreover, there is an inconvenient footnote to the assertion that Islam is anti-American: Muslims arrived here before the founding of the United States — not just a few, but thousands.""
Muslims have been ""overlooked because they were not free to practice their faith,"" Manseau wrote.
Manseau’s piece discusses a man called Estevanico who was raised in Azemmour, a Moroccan city that was once a ""Muslim stronghold against European invasion."" In 1528, an enslaved Estevanico and Spanish explorers were shipwrecked near present-day Galveston, Texas. Estevanico eventually escaped his Christian captors and lived in the Southwest, Manseau wrote.
In the 1700s, Louisiana plantation owners ""made it a point to add enslaved Muslims to their labor force, relying on their experience with the cultivation of indigo and rice,"" the New York Times piece said.
Arabs in America , a project at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also says scholars believe Estevanico was a practicing Muslim, ""though he nominally converted to Catholicism to appease his Spanish masters.""
The Clinton campaign also sent over a Q&A page on Tolerance.org about Muslims that says they arrived in America more than 400 years ago as slaves and that many practiced their faith in secret. They also pointed to a PBS feature on Islam in America that says 10 to 15 percent of African slaves were believed to be Muslims.
Experts also backed up Clinton’s claim.
Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, a professor of religion and humanities at Reed College, also noted that the National Portrait Gallery includes a portrait of Yarrow Mamout , identified as an African-American Muslim man and former slave.
""His portrait reminds us that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the beginning,"" Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said in a July 2016 press statement when it was announced the portrait would be added as part of the museum’s annual rotations.
Scholars also referred us to a post about the Founding Fathers and Islam by James H. Hutson, chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress.
""Readers may be surprised to learn that there may have been hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims in the United States in 1776 — imported as slaves from areas of Africa where Islam flourished,"" Hutson wrote . ""Although there is no evidence that the Founders were aware of the religious convictions of their bondsmen, it is clear that the Founding Fathers thought about the relationship of Islam to the new nation and were prepared to make a place for it in the republic.""
Washington said he would welcome Muslims to Mount Vernon (his home) ""if they were ‘good workmen’,"" Hutson said. Washington also ""suggested a way for Muslims to ‘obtain proper relief’ "" from a proposed bill in Virginia levying taxes to aid Christian worship, according to Hutson.
The post goes on to detail how the Founding Fathers in 1780 made sure the Constitution afforded ""the most ample liberty of conscience … to Deists, Mahometans, Jews and Christians’,"" Hutson wrote.
""I think that what Secretary Clinton was suggesting by her reference to George Washington was that not only have Muslims lived in the U.S. for centuries, but that our Founding Fathers — not only George Washington but also Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and the men who wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution — believed that Muslims should be free to practice their own religion, and they tried to guarantee this freedom and protect it in some of our Founding documents,"" said Jan Ellen Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University who has contributed $700 to Clinton’s campaign.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election."" In one of the most heated moments of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over Russia’s interference in the current election.
Speaking of the WikiLeaks’ release of tens of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign and, earlier, the Democratic National Committee , Trump said Clinton had no idea who hacked and released the emails — ""Russia, China or anybody else.""
Clinton responded by asking Trump if he really doesn’t believe the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have said Russia is behind the cyberattack.
""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,"" Clinton said. ""I find that deeply disturbing.""
Back in July , when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadn’t yet named a culprit.
On Oct. 7, however — the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.""
The statement added that the recent hacks ""are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.""
The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said.
""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the statement said.
The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies , forming the basis of Clinton’s claim.

The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clinton’s point, saying, ""It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate.""

"Says Donald Trump’s tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations ""more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two."" With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate.
When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most.
""His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,"" Clinton said . ""Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.""
Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts?
The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP.
The evidence shows Clinton is right.
The Bush tax cuts
As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003,  reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth.
The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 ( tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year).
Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP , while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.)
Trump’s plan
Trump’s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP.
Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan , released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check.
First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.)
Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently ""pass through"" the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders.
In its analysis of Trump’s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan’s impact on individual taxpayers.
The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here’s a table breaking down Trump’s proposed tax cuts by income group:
Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income.
The think tank also said the Trump’s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP.
Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump.
The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break.
Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years .
While Trump’s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he’s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent — an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted .",1,Hillary Clinton
"""The Notebook is finally getting a sequel. Producers of the upcoming film confirmed .... that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer."" Fans of The Notebook have waited even longer for a sequel to the beloved movie than Allie waited for Noah.
Some of them rejoiced recently when news broke that The Notebook 2 was already set to film on the North Carolina coast.
""The very popular 2004 romantic drama film The Notebook is finally getting a sequel,"" reported the website WBN10. ""Producers of the upcoming film confirmed the news today and announced that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer.""
It later continues with some key details, sure to excite locals: ""The film will take place primarily in the Jacksonville area and will film on location there as well. A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months.""
We were intrigued, and broke out a box of tissues just in case the tears started flowing.
It wouldn’t be too crazy of an announcement. Sequels are all the rage in Hollywood these days, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants to bring back the state’s tax credit for film projects – a campaign promise we’ve rated as In The Works on our Coop-O-Meter.
What’s more, Nicholas Sparks – author of ""The Notebook"" and other popular books – lives in New Bern, not far from Jacksonville. Many of his books are set in North Carolina, and a few of the film versions have been shot here, too, including ""A Walk To Remember,"" ""Safe Haven"" and ""The Longest Ride.""
The state’s official tourism bureau even has a guide for a three-day trip around eastern North Carolina, which it calls ""A Nicholas Sparks Tour of the North Carolina Coast.""
And Sparks has written a sequel to The Notebook, which is called The Wedding and hasn’t been made into a movie – yet.
The stars seemed to align for this rumor. But sadly, it’s fake news.
'
A quick search online led to something almost as good as a real movie announcement – a video clip of Conan O’Brien and Ryan Reynolds reenacting The Notebook’s famous kissing-in-the-rain scene, which they jokingly claimed was a trailer for The Notebook 2.
This sequel, they said, would be starring Reynolds in the place of Ryan Gosling and O’Brien in the place of Rachel McAdams.
So we were pretty sure his Notebook 2 announcement was a joke.
But the article circulating about Jacksonville and the film was not nearly so satirical.
It correctly named the director of the first film and the place in South Carolina where it was filmed, it gives a brief outline of the plot and has several quotes from unnamed producers from the unnamed company that was allegedly behind the film.
The website does contain a disclaimer that it’s a satirical site, but it takes an extra click or two to find and isn’t immediately obvious.
And just in case the website had accidentally stumbled onto the truth, we checked with the people who would know if there actually are plans for this movie in the works.
Alas, they say, there’s no Notebook 2.
""We have not been contacted by this production,"" said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission in eastern North Carolina.
He would know; his office was in charge of collecting resumes from local crew members the last time a Sparks movie actually filmed in the area – which was ""The Longest Ride"" in 2014.
And the N.C. Department of Commerce, which oversees the N.C. Film Office, said there was no Notebook 2 project anywhere in the state.
""The Film Office is not working on/with any ""Notebook 2"" project,"" Commerce Department spokesman David Rhoades said in an email.",0,Bloggers
"""Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' "" In his Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III talked about the immigrant roots of a city in his Boston-area district.
""We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts, a proud American city,"" Kennedy said, speaking from a vocational technical high school. ""An American city built by immigrants.""
Breitbart , a conservative website formerly run by Steve Bannon who served as Trump’s strategist, fired back at Kennedy’s description of the city.
""No, Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants,' "" stated the headline. ""Fact-Check: Mostly False.""
We decided to do a fact-check of our own of Breitbart’s claim.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found the Breitbart story glosses over the role of immigrants in the city’s history.
As evidence, Breitbart wrote that Fall River was established in the 1600s by English settlers ""who were not ‘immigrants’ but colonists.""
Breitbart wrote that a native-born family, the Bordens, ran a mill in what became the town before and after the American Revolutionary War. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Breitbart said that immigrants arrived at the end of the 19th century.
Breitbart has a point that English settlers arrived before other immigrant groups, but when the town truly took off due to the textile mills, it was waves of immigrant labor that fueled the growth.
We interviewed Bridgewater State University professor Philip Silvia who wrote his dissertation on local history, The Spindle City: Labor, Politics and Religion in Fall River (1870-1905). Silvia has taught courses on Fall River’s immigrant and labor history.
Fall River was settled by English immigrants in the 1600s when few people lived in the area, Silvia said. But ultimately, ""it attracted immigrants like no other place,"" Silvia said.
Fall River became prominent in the 19th century when textile factories were constructed. The mills drew various waves of immigrants from different nationalities, including the English and the Irish.
Fall River incorporated as a town in 1803 and as a city in 1854.
The real surge occurred after the Civil War when Fall River became the pre-eminent textile city in the United States, fueling a massive influx of immigrant workers.
A gigantic wave came from French Canada, the largest immigrant group for decades.
""Technically one could argue it wasn’t immigrants supplying the capital who built the mills, but without workers, the mills would not have succeeded as they did,"" Silvia said.
Breitbart pointed to immigrant statistics in 1910 and wrote that immigrants "" never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.""
But Silvia, who wrote his dissertation on the topic, said that by 1875, more than half of the population was foreign born.
By the 1870s, three-quarters of the mill population were immigrants and that population climbed even higher.
Eventually immigrants included those who were Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Jewish and Scottish. Later waves came from Vietnam and Cambodia.
Around 1900, there were 18 ethnic groups in the city.
""It is an immigrant city,"" he said.
Kennedy’s spokesman pointed to an article by the local newspaper that covers Fall River,  The Herald News , documenting visible signs around the city that show its immigrant history.
""From the Fabergé egg-shaped bell towers of St. Anne’s Church to the Portuguese bakeries that line Columbia Street, Fall River would not be Fall River without its immigrants...,"" stated the newspaper following Breitbart’s article about Kennedy’s speech. ""Fall River’s notable churches and many of its landmarks were built by the people who began arriving on its streets in the mid-19th century from Ireland, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, Poland and Portugal, and in recent years from Brazil, Syria, Haiti, Cambodia and elsewhere.""
As of 2016, about 18 percent of the city’s population of 90,000 is foreign born, according to the U.S. Census.
We attempted to reach Breitbart and did not get a reply.
Breitbart wrote that, ""Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' ""
English settlers first established Fall River in the 1600s when it was sparsely populated. But Breitbart gives short shrift to the role waves of immigrants played in growing the community as it turned into a prominent textile city in the 1800s.",0,Breitbart
"""(My dad) used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs."" Republican Mitt Romney, speaking from the campaign trail in Michigan, recalled his father's legacy as the owner of American Motors Corp. and the car that changed the industry.
""But, you see, when I was growing up, the fact that we won the mileage championship year after year with the Rambler was a source of great pride for my dad,"" Romney said during an interview on the CBS Early Show . ""He used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs.""
Romney used a similar line in February 2007 when he launched his presidential campaign in Michigan, where he was born. It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really?
And yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin.
He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called ""gas-guzzling dinosaurs,"" a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers.
""Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?"" he told Time magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney ""The Dinosaur Hunter.""
He is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995.
His youngest son, Mitt, gets it right.",1,Mitt Romney
"Federal spending is ""all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid."" Members of Congress are actively working to cut the federal budget and bring down spending. But they’re steering clear of the politically difficult, big-ticket items such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt and national defense.
""It's not being debated because they say we're only going to debate discretionary spending. We should ban that word,"" said conservative commentator George F. Will on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.
""It's all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid,"" Will said.
We thought Will’s statement was a provocative and interesting way to frame the debate. But was it true? We decided to check it out.
We’ll begin with a brief lesson on the terms Congress uses to describe the federal budget.
Discretionary spending means government spending that Congress sets every year through a process known as appropriations. It includes spending for most federal agencies, such as transportation and health. It includes foreign aid and defense spending. And it includes most grant programs administered by the federal government.
Non-discretionary spending, on the other hand, is spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas. It includes entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria. It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify, such as farm subsidies or military benefits. Sometimes non-discretionary spending is called mandatory spending or direct spending.
We ran Will’s comments by four experts on the federal budget. They all said that Will was essentially correct, that non-discretionary spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program.
A recent example of this is the health care law supported by President Obama and Democrats in Congress. The law made many changes to Medicare, to reduce its spending, in order to offer subsidies for health care insurance to the uninsured.
""There is no constitutional roadblock to Congress changing any spending at any time. In that sense, all spending is discretionary,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The reasons members of Congress are now so focused on discretionary spending is because it’s more politically difficult to change programs that affect benefits for so many voters.
""But you can’t stabilize the debt by focusing on only 12 percent of the budget,"" Goldwein added. ""Trying to do so is going to make the cuts far more painful than what would be necessary if we were to look more broadly.""
Both Medicare and Social Security were on the table in previous years when the budget needed adjustment, said the experts we consulted on both sides of the political aisle. Jim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that ""every major deficit reduction plan in the last 20 years has made significant changes to Medicare."" Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation pointed out that Social Security was changed significantly in 1983 in a deal between Democrats in Congress and President Ronald Reagan.
Interest on the federal debt is a required payment unless the government is willing to default, a highly unlikely scenario. There are a few other contractually obligated payments the government has to make, typically for insurance programs such as mortgage insurance, flood insurance, and federal deposit insurance. But those payments are relatively small.
""I would add that even interest on the debt is in some way discretionary, because levels of debt can be changed by decisions to tax and spend and not run budget deficits,"" said Josh Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that wants to eliminate deficits.
Will said that federal spending is ""all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid."" Will is making a broad statement here and leaves out a few details.",1,George Will
"Western Europeans ""can fly in the United States without even having a visa."" The slayings in France have raised awareness that terrorist threats can spring up on European soil. And if terrorists can emerge there among people holding European passports, they could come here.
Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, highlighted that risk during an interview on CBS News’  Face the Nation  on Sunday. McCaul worried about jihadists who, like one of the killers in France, trained with terrorists in Yemen and returned to France. McCaul said tracking them is pivotal.
""Western Europe, again, is more lenient in their travel restrictions,"" McCaul said. ""And we have a visa waiver-free system where they can fly in the United States without even having a visa. We need to look at all sorts of things like that.""
We decided to take a closer look at McCaul’s claim that Europeans can fly to America without a visa.
A quick peek at the State Department website shows that McCaul has it right. Tourists from 28 European nations do not need a visa for visits that last no longer than three months. However, they do need to complete an online application , and in some cases, U.S. officials will deny them entry.
The application covers the basics of name, address, passport number, employment status and so forth. The Department of Homeland Security recently added a couple of questions to that application precisely because it would help authorities spot travelers who bear a closer look. People now need to report if they have a second passport for another country or have ever traveled under another name. Experts we reached suggested these details do less to uncover suspicious individuals themselves and are more aimed at avoiding false positives in the system, which wastes precious resources.
If McCaul is correct about the visa waiver for Europeans, then the next question is, how big a gap does this represent in border security?
Assessing the risk from Europe
A report from the Henry Jackson Society , a London-based group that favors a strong military to support liberal democracies, examined the number of al-Qaida-related incidents in the United States that had a European connection. It found that since 2003, there has been only one case, that of the so-called ""underwear bomber"" in 2009. The authors looked at whether perpetrators in the United States had any terrorist training.
""Since 2005, individuals charged were less likely to have terrorist training or combat experience; less likely to be linked to al-Qaida or another Designated Terrorist Organisation; and, subsequently, less likely of carrying out an attack that could lead to mass casualties,"" the authors wrote.
They concluded that the European and American counterterrorism strategy had been effective in reducing the threat of an al-Qaida-related attack in the United States, although the Boston Marathon bombing showed that the risk was ongoing.
That report came out in 2013. The security experts we reached generally echoed its findings, but they also noted that the number of Europeans who have gone to the Middle East in pursuit of jihad has climbed sharply.
""The jihadists now have a lot of people with western passports,"" said Brian Jenkins, a RAND Corporation advisor and a former member of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. ""It is a potential vulnerability.""
But Jenkins also described the current methods that might catch the would-be terrorist.
A number of security filters
Jenkins walked through the example of a French citizen who went to Yemen.
""The minute they went to Yemen, the intelligence services there are cooperative,"" Jenkins said. ""We’d likely spot them on the way in and on the way out. Also, the European intelligence agencies would have a chance of picking them up, and that info would be shared with us.""
Jenkins spoke of the lists the United States maintains, beyond the no-fly list of suspicious individuals. He said there are other databases. For many years, American security agencies have used airline data known as the Passenger Name Record. It provides information on how and where a reservation was made and how it was paid for. The PNR data is assessed before someone boards a plane and while they are en route.
""I wouldn’t say that there is racial or ethnic profiling here, but we have pretty good profiles of tourists and what they look like,"" Jenkins said. ""If there are anomalies, that person gets looked at.""
Should the person land in the United States, Jenkins said the track record of domestic counterterrorism has been pretty good. A Saudi citizen was caught in Dallas when he tried to link up with radical Islamic sympathizers.
In Jenkins’ view, the greater risk for Americans comes from people who already live here.
""When we look at the terror attacks in the United States since 9-11, the overwhelming number are homegrown,"" Jenkins said.
William Braniff is executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Braniff said there are two ways to assess how effective the current strategy has been.
""At best, it does prevent known terrorists from entering the country,"" Braniff said. ""At worst, it may serve as a deterrent. Attacking in Europe may be perceived as less risky but of similar reward than risking the flight to the United States.""
Braniff cautioned, however, that the proliferation of databases and security filters comes with its own drawbacks.
""When you get to 50,000 names, countless transliterations, and then bury them among the millions of names of air travelers coming to or from the U.S., implementation can become unwieldy,"" Braniff said.
Both Braniff and Jenkins noted that efforts to tighten entry rules for Europeans would have to be balanced against the strong economic benefits of tourism and business that the current system allows.",1,Michael McCaul
"Tells President Barack Obama that he also asked former President George W. Bush about how he felt about Americans hating him. During a Super Bowl interview on Feb. 6, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly prefaced a sensitive question to President Barack Obama by saying that he had asked the same question in a previous interview with former President George W. Bush.
""I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago,"" O’Reilly said to Obama. ""Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it's a serious question.""
A reader wrote to us to ask whether O’Reilly did ask that question of Bush. So we looked into it.
We discovered that O’Reilly was referring to an interview aired on Nov. 11, 2010 , when Bush, by then out of office for almost two years, was doing publicity for his memoir, Decision Points .
Here’s the exchange between O’Reilly and Bush:
O’REILLY: ""Okay. But, the people in the press hated you, a lot of them. Why? Why?""
BUSH : ""I don’t know. You have to ask them. I’m not a hater, and so sometimes it’s hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody. It could have been because of my policies, maybe they didn’t like my religion. I don’t know. I’m sure there’s a myriad of reasons. That’s what happens when you’re the president. It can either bother you or not bother you. I chose --
O""REILLY: ""You ever think about it?""
BUSH: ""Being hated? No, not really.""
O’REILLY: ""Really? Never?""
BUSH: ""No. I’m a pretty comfortable guy right now, you know.""
O’REILLY: ""You look it.""
BUSH: ""I really am. I’m honored to have served. I’m glad I served, and I gave it my all, and that’s all you can do at life. I got back -- and this sounds corny to some, I understand, but when I looked in the mirror, I know I didn’t sell my soul for the sake of any short-term politics or popularity. I think that’s important.""
For the record, here’s how Obama answered O’Reilly: ""You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don't know you. … What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that's out there. … I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn't, then you probably wouldn't have gotten here.""
Technically, O’Reilly asked slightly different questions of each president. To Obama, he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by ""so many"" Americans. To Bush, he asked how he felt about being hated by ""a lot of"" people in the press, and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated.
Still, O’Reilly’s two lines of inquiry are similar enough that we’re giving O’Reilly a True.",1,Bill O'Reilly
"""Every (Wisconsin) legislator that votes for this bill"" will have to ""give up the same amount of pay"" as other state employees. Facing a budget shortfall, many legislators in Wisconsin have talked about the need for shared sacrifice to justify Gov. Scott Walker's plan to require state employees to pay more for health and pension benefits.
But what about the elected officials themselves? Are they making a sacrifice?
In an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity on Feb. 22, 2011, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, said Wisconsin legislators would be subject to the same cuts the governor is proposing for other government workers.
""You know, we are all in this together,"" Fitzgerald said. ""Every legislator that votes for this bill as well is going to do the same for themselves. We have to give up the same amount of pay.""
Amid the fiery debate over benefits cuts and collective bargaining rights -- and the potential ripple effect around the nation -- we haven't heard much about how Walker's plan would personally affect the legislators who will vote on it, so we decided to check Fitzgerald's comment.
Walker's plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs -- typically 5.8 percent of pay for state workers -- and at least 12 percent of their health care costs.
A detailed analysis of Walker's proposal by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says that under Walker's plan any participant in the Wisconsin Retirement System, including elected officials, ""would be required to make an employee contribution to the WRS in an amount equal to one-half of all actuarially-required contributions, as approved by the Employee Trust Fund (ETF) Board.""
Under current 2011 rates, one half of the general participant rate would be 5.8 percent and one half of the executive/elected official rate would be 6.65 percent. So elected officials would actually be paying a little more than government workers, said Robert Lang, director of the Wisconsin's Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Currently, Lang noted, most general government employees pay a slight share -- less than 1 percent of their salary -- toward their pension, and elected officials don't pay anything.
As for health benefits, the bill doesn't specifically mention the effect on elected officials. It simply talks about changes related to anyone participating in the state's ""group insurance board coverage."" That includes elected officials, Lang said. So elected officials also would have to pay the same share for health care as all state employees covered by the health plan. (For details, see pages 29 and 30 of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis ).
There's one other piece of the bill that would affect the benefits of elected officials, and it has to do with the way pension benefits are calculated. Pension payments are based on a formula derived from the employee's salary, years of service and a set multiplier. For general employees, that multiplier is 1.6. For elected officials, the multiplier is currently 2.0. Under the budget repair bill, however, the multiplier for elected officials would drop to 1.6, the same as everyone else (see page 3 of the budget repair bill, or page 33 of the Fiscal Bureau analysis for further details). Bottom line, they'll be getting less in their pension checks. The new, lower multiplier won't take effect until the next legislative session.
We also ran Fitzgerald's statement by Jeff Leverich, senior researcher for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, and he agreed with Lang.
""That is our understanding too, co-pay applies to elected officials; however, some ambiguity remains about when they might be enacted given statutory language governing timing of compensation changes for  elected"" officials, Leverich stated via e-mail.
According to Lang, elected officials would have to start paying more toward pension and health benefits immediately, just like everyone else.
Leverich, of WEAC, also argued that while co-pays may be the same for elected officials, there would still be a disparity in bargaining positions.
""Please realize, however, that the elimination of bargaining rights is a different order of magnitude,"" Leverich said. ""The effects of the legislation on the two parties (legislators/public workers) is truly dissimilar.""
In short, Fitzgerald said the legislators who will vote on Walker's bill would have to give up the same amount of pay. Aside from the collective bargaining issues, Walker's plan would make state employees pay more for health and pension benefits. And according to the bill, elected officials would take the same hits.",1,Jeff Fitzgerald
"""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay."" A vote at the United Nations on a resolution about the death penalty has led to some inaccurate headlines about President Donald Trump.
""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay,"" said a May 7 headline on the WashingtonSources website.
The story, which repeats a claim circulating for months, said that the vote put the United States in the same category as China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We found that the United States voted against a resolution that called for an overall ban on the death penalty, not a ban specific to gays and lesbians. The United States has said formally that it opposes the death penalty for people in same-sex relationships.
Death penalty resolution
While the story said that the vote ""just"" took place, it actually happened several months ago.
On Sept. 29, the UN Human Rights Council voted on a broad resolution about the death penalty. Among other things, the resolution condemned imposing the death penalty ""as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations, and expressing serious concern that the application of the death penalty for adultery is disproportionately imposed on women.""
The resolution also stated that the Secretary General had found discriminatory use of the death penalty, including based on sexual orientation.
The four-page resolution includes a long list of arguments against the death penalty, and said that states that have not abolished the death penalty should ""consider doing so.""
The United States was one of 13 countries to vote against the resolution, while 27 nations voted in favor and seven abstained.
(The story said that Trump took the vote, but technically U.S. voting decisions are reached through internal discussions involving senior officials.)
The U.S. statement about the vote made no specific mention of same-sex individuals. Instead, it said that the United States opposed the resolution because the resolution advocated for the outright abolition of the death penalty.
""The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a state’s international obligations.""
The Trump administration faced a barrage of negative headlines about the section of the resolution pertaining to people who are gay.
Days after the vote, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert reiterated that the U.S. was against a broad condemnation of the death penalty, but also spoke up about the portion that pertained to people who are engaged in same-sex relations:
""The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization.""
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, also pushed back against the headlines. She tweeted Oct. 3: ""Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community.""
Impact of the resolution
After Nauert’s statement, some gay rights activists remained critical of the vote.
The Human Rights Campaign stated that it ""welcomes this clarification but continues to be concerned about the Trump/Pence administration’s engagement on the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad. It is disturbing that leadership in this administration did not discuss this position in their original explanation for the ""no"" vote .""
According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association , as of 2017 there were six countries (eight if we count the parts of Syria and Iraq still occupied by ISIS) where the death penalty is implemented for same-sex relations. There were also five where it is technically allowed (if not actually invoked), and one where it has not yet been implemented.
John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, an organization that opposes the death penalty, told PolitiFact that the United States made clear that it's vote against the resolution was not based on the reference to same-sex conduct.
The United States has traditionally had issues with death penalty resolutions at UN forums, said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch.
""HRC resolutions have political power in that they are expressions of a key collective body, the UN’s top human rights body,"" he said. ""But they’re not legally binding in the way that Security Council resolutions can be.""",0,WashingtonSources
"""I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office."" A Democratic lawmaker who disapproves of President Donald Trump recently suggested the 25th Amendment to the Constitution could provide a solution.
""POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger,"" Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., tweeted on Aug. 15. ""Time to invoke the 25th Amendment.""
But not all Democrats see the 25th amendment as an appropriate way of responding to Trump.
Asked whether he thinks it should be used against Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the amendment does not apply to present circumstances.
""I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office,"" Schiff said Aug. 20 on CNN’s State of the Union. ""I think we're still far from concluding that that's the case, even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here.""
For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Schiff’s reading of the amendment’s origins is right. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump’s actions or mental state fit the criteria for presidential disability.
What does the 25th Amendment say?
The 25th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, sought to resolve several thorny issues of presidential and vice presidential power. It creates a succession plan for when these top two positions go vacant. It also allows the president to declare himself unable to fulfill his duties and transfer power to the vice president.
However, we’re mostly interested in the 25th Amendment’s fourth and final section, which allows someone other than the president to make a finding of presidential disability.
Section four authorizes the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet, or another body as determined by lawmakers, to declare a president ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" Doing so would then elevate the vice president to the position of acting president.
The president can restore his powers by declaring that no inability exists. However, the same body that initially transferred power to the vice president can respond by essentially doubling down on their declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties.
Then, if Congress, by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, agrees that the president is unable to serve, the vice president continues to act as president. Such a move could permanently strip a president of his powers — hence, why some legal analysts refer to section four as the "" involuntary removal mechanism .""
What did the authors intend?
The push for Congress to formalize a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963 (though lawmakers had first considered it much earlier in American history).
""The assassination of President Kennedy ... produced a flurry of additional proposals dealing with the subject,"" John D. Feerick wrote in a 1995 article in the Wake Forest Law Review. ""These proposals were influenced by the sense at that time that, if Kennedy had lived, the country would have had to deal with the problem of presidential inability in a most tragic setting.""
As congressional hearings unfolded, little controversy surrounded the amendment’s first three sections, according to Feerick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real debate centered on when someone other than the president could declare him or her to be incapacitated.
The amendment’s principal author, Sen. Birch Bayh, D.-Ind., embraced an understanding that presidential inability would encompass both physical and mental inability, said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University, who’s closely studied the congressional record.
The formulation he adopted was put forth by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who said presidential inability ""involves physical or mental inability to make or communicate his decision regarding his capacity and physical or mental inability to exercise the powers and duties of his office.""
Another important architect of the amendment, Rep. Richard Poff, R-Va., held a similar view, according to Goldstein.
Poff said section four not only applied when the president, due to accident or illness, was unconscious or otherwise unable to make or communicate a decision, but also when ""the President, by reason of mental debility, is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision, including particularly the decision to stand aside.""
On July 6, 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and the necessary 38 states ratified it Feb. 10, 1967.
Legal experts told us the drafters used intentionally vague and open-ended language (i.e., a president who is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."") because they recognized they couldn't predict every scenario in which a president could be deemed disabled.
But despite the definition’s fuzziness, Goldstein said ""the record makes clear that section four was not intended as a means of removing the president simply because he or she makes an unpopular decision.""
So did Schiff’s claim that the authors intended to cover physical incapacitation, serious mental illness and a general an inability to function, hit the mark?
""I think he’s right, as far as a one-sentence summary could have it,"" said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. ""They made the process and the terms flexible, but that was what they were mainly thinking of.""",1,Adam Schiff
"""(James) Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary (Clinton)."" A conspiracy theory that said former FBI director James Comey was covering up the source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails for Hillary Clinton is based on a single source that has admitted he had no evidence.
The headline on a May 16, 2017, post on PatriotCrier.com read, ""Bombshell: Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary."" Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news.
The post is based on a persistent and unfounded conspiracy theory about how the website WikiLeaks came by thousands of internal DNC emails during last year’s presidential election.
Seth Rich's death
Seth Rich was a 27-year-old voter access projects staffer for the DNC who was shot and killed near his Washington home on July 10, 2016. The case is still unsolved, but Washington police said it was probably a botched robbery.
WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Rich’s death. Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails, and was killed to scare other potential leakers. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for more information about Rich’s death, drawing some attention to the scenario.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source.
On May 15, Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by Rich’s family, claimed he could prove Rich was indeed the source of the leak. He told Washington-area Fox affiliate WTTG that sources in the FBI said they had evidence proving it.
The next day, Fox News reported an anonymous federal investigator backed up what Wheeler was saying. This official said the FBI had determined Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks, sending them more than 40,000 DNC emails.
Most of the PatriotCrier.com conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection.
""It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement, but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey, locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three,"" the PatriotCrier.com post read.
There is no contact information on PatriotCrier.com, and we did not receive a response when we contacted the site through an affiliated Facebook page . The site’s registration information is hidden .
It’s quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence, drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton.
Wheeler didn’t even mention the former FBI director, and we didn’t find any evidence of Comey commenting on Rich’s death. The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar, confined to corners of the Internet, until Wheeler’s story emerged, by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump.
But the more egregious problem with the PatriotCrier.com post is that it didn’t include what happened next: Wheeler admitted to CNN on March 16 that he had actually gotten the information from the Fox News reporter to whom he had discussed the issue.
The Rich family sent Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter , saying their son was not WikiLeaks ’ source. They also demanded retractions from Fox for reporting the story.
Fox News eventually retracted its story and removed it from FoxNews.com. WTTG posted a follow-up to its story , saying Wheeler had backtracked on what he described as a ""miscommunication.""
The FBI has not officially acknowledged conducting an investigation ( a WhiteHouse.gov petition demanding Comey get involved was created in January 2017, but has so far only garnered about 1,000 signatures).
Some media outlets have reported that anonymous FBI and law enforcement officials confirmed the agency is not investigating Rich’s death, and that Washington police never gave them Rich’s laptop and therefore the agency hadn’t examined its contents.
An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department.
What the FBI did do is alert the DNC of a data breach prior to the WikiLeaks release, and subsequently connected the breach to hackers with Russian ties .
The only other source even remotely supporting the idea Rich was involved is a hacker living in New Zealand named Kim Dotcom. He said someone going by the name of Panda had contacted him in 2014 to get help starting a political group in the United States. Dotcom said he is certain Panda was actually Rich, and knows that Rich was the WikiLeaks source. He has not shown any proof.
Dotcom is currently facing extradition to the United States on a host of conspiracy and racketeering charges levied by the Justice Department. Rich’s family also has denied the link Dotcom is making between Rich and WikiLeaks, and has said Dotcom actually tried to plant bogus evidence implicating Rich . And in any event, the PatriotCrier.com post didn’t make any mention of Dotcom or his claims.
The Metropolitan Police Department, meanwhile, is still investigating Rich’s death as a homicide.",0,PatriotCrier.com
"""The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents – more than twice as many as there were in 2004."" In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied.
""Under Secretary Napolitano’s leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible,"" Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. ""They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued.""
Obama said that commitment is beyond what was requested by some Republicans ""who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement.""
""I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time,"" Obama said. ""They’ll say we need to triple the border patrol.  Or quadruple the border patrol.""
Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that ""Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history."" (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that ""We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history.""
We rated both of those claims Mostly True, noting that while border patrol manpower is at an all-time modern high, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916 .
Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that ""the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004.""
There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.
That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase).
Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase).
According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service , ""Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration.""
The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370.
Jack Martin, special projects director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, said Obama's statistic is true but that much of the credit for starting the trend toward more border security goes to Obama's predecessor.
""There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks,"" Martin said. ""The increase has by necessity been gradual because it is limited by the capacity of the BP training facility.""
In March 2011, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report, ""Border Security: DHS Progress and Challenges in Securing the U.S. Southwest and Northern Borders,"" in conjunction with testimony from GAO Director Richard Stana.
The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders.  That number now stands at nearly 21,000.
In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama.",1,Barack Obama
"""The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the U.S."" Thanks to a little-known congressional bill, it may soon be impossible to tell whether your Fourth of July burger is all-American Angus or beef imported from the Amazon, according to a Facebook meme.
""The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the United States,"" the meme says . ""Sorry but you don’t deserve to know where your meat is coming from.""
What beef could the House possibly have with the consumer-friendly law? We looked into the vote in question and found an interesting story of international trade disputes, riled up Canadian hog farmers, and ""jingoist fears.""
Meat of the matter
Under the country-of-origin labeling law, or COOL , supermarkets have to tell consumers where their meat, fish, and nuts are produced with varying degrees of specificity (i.e. ""Born in Canada, Slaughtered in the U.S."", ""Farm-Raised in Vietnam"", or simply a laundry list of all the countries the product has passed through). COOL passed in 2002 but wasn’t fully implemented until March 2009.
By then, Canada already had a bone to pick with the law, saying it violated World Trade Organization agreements. A mandatory ""made-in"" stamp discriminated against foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and was too costly to boot, according to Canada. Joining Canada’s complaint were a long list of other countries.
Between 2011 and 2015, the WTO ruled four times that COOL was inconsistent with trade agreements. The United States made several unsuccessful appeals, but eventually Canada and Mexico asked the WTO for permission to impose retaliatory tariffs totalling $3 billion. The WTO’s decision is pending.
In May of 2015, House Agriculture Committee Chair K. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, introduced H.R. 2393 , a bill to repeal the labeling requirements for ground and muscle cuts of beef and pork -- and threw in chicken for good measure.
""Retaliation by Canada and Mexico will soon become a reality, meaning economically devastating tariffs on a broad spectrum of U.S. exports,"" Conaway wrote in Roll Call. ""Ripple effects will be felt in nearly every industry, every state and every consumer’s wallet. This is why COOL for beef, pork and chicken — nothing more than a failed government experiment — must be repealed.""
On June 10, the House passed the repeal bill by a not-entirely partisan vote of 300-131 : a third of House Democrats voted in favor of the Republican-backed bill.
Saving COOL’s bacon
The meme’s wording implies that the country-of-origin labeling law’s fate is sealed, but that’s a bit hammed up. The bill now awaits the Senate’s and, ultimately, President Barack Obama’s approval. In the upper chamber, COOL repeal will be more of a battle.
""The politics are going to be much, much more difficult in the Senate,"" said Victoria Guida, a trade reporter for Politico. ""Part of the reason this passed the House so easily is because so many other industries, outside of the meat world, are freaked out about retaliation. But the Senate tends to be a little more big-picture about policies, and straight repeal is expected to have a tough time.""
The Senate Agricultural Committee held hearings on June 25, where Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., called for repeal. In lieu of completely getting rid of the labeling law, top Democrat, Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, proposed a voluntary labeling system supported by some Republicans but rejected by Conaway .
We didn’t hear back from the White House about what the president plans to do if the bill reaches his desk.
If the repeal is greenlit by both the Senate and the White House, country-of-origin still won’t be prohibited from meat packaging. As per Stabenow’s proposal, it could potentially mirror the USDA’s paid grading service of beef (i.e. ""prime choice"" and ""select""), though supporters say that’s not enough.
""The (meat) industry has had plenty of time to do a COOL program, and they didn't. So we have mandatory COOL. That is the solution that provides consumers with what they’re demanding,"" Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America.
What’s at 'steak'
At its core, COOL is a consumer rights law, intended to help people make purchasing decisions -- be it supporting American ranchers or boycotting beef associated with Amazon deforestation. Yet it has provoked intense debate.
While 90 percent of Americans want country-of-origin labeling, the interest doesn’t necessarily reflect in the dollars spent, says Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.
""Analysis of scanner data from grocery stores shows essentially no impact of (mandatory country-of-origin labeling) when buying meat,"" he said. ""Despite this, there are real and demonstrable costs to processors and retailers. Thus, the totality of evidence suggests that COOL does not pass a cost-benefit test.""
Canada and Mexico have also argued that the labeling might make people think U.S. products are safer, even when experts say there is little evidence to support or refute that point.
""U.S. companies have been doing a marvelous job of poisoning us for years,"" said Bill Marler, a food-borne illness attorney and publisher of Food Safety News. He pointed out that Malaysia banned American apples earlier this year due to a listeria outbreak, and Mexico rejected Californian lettuce in 2006 after growers found E. coli on the crop.
While Marler thinks COOL can feed ""jingoist fears,"" he nonetheless supports it, as he believes in greater transparency in the food system. Like Marler, 283 consumer, agricultural, environmental, labor, and faith-based groups say COOL is about empowering consumers. In a letter ultimately unheeded by Conaway, they urged the House to not bow to the standard scare tactics of trade partners.
""We shouldn't automatically repeal a law passed by Congress because an international trade tribunal tells us it violates trade law. We first need to look at other options aside from repeal,"" said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a sustainable farming advocacy group. He added that COOL laws exist around the world , and United States has willingly paid tariffs when it’s disagreed with past WTO rulings.
""Consumers have a legitimate interest in knowing where their food comes from,"" said Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America.",1,Facebook posts
"""This week the House of Representatives voted to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law."" The first week of December in Congress was dominated by news about the fiscal cliff. So you will forgive us if we overlooked this other tidbit tucked into the final weekly newsletter sent by U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens.
""This week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the word ‘lunatic’ from federal law,"" wrote West, who lost a close race to Democrat Patrick Murphy in District 18 in Florida’s Treasure Coast. ""However, that does not mean there isn't plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government!""
We can’t fact-check the amount of lunacy in Washington, D.C., but we couldn’t resist looking into whether the House actually voted to remove the word ""lunatic"" from federal law.
On Dec. 5, the House voted 398-1 in favor of Senate Bill 2367 , the 21st Century Language Act of 2012. The bill, which the Senate approved by unanimous consent in May, struck the word ""lunatic"" from federal law. As of Dec. 17, it was awaiting President Barack Obama’s signature.
The vote was part of an effort to remove outdated and demeaning language, and it was supported by advocates for people with mental health conditions. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., in response to a constituent’s request.
""The term ‘lunatic’ derives from the Latin word for ‘moon,’ "" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, before the House vote, according to the congressional record. ""Before the modern era, it was used to describe a person who suffers from mental disease because of the belief that lunar cycles had an impact on brain function. But as science and medicine have progressed, society has come to understand mental illness with more clarity.""
Rep. Robert C. Scott, D-Va., said ""this bill eliminates outdated references in the U.S. Code that stigmatize individuals with mental illness issues. ... The term ‘lunatic’ holds a place in antiquity and should no longer have a prominent place in our U.S. Code.""
Scott compared it to a law in 2010 that replaced parts of federal law containing the phrase ""having mental retardation'' with the phrase ""having intellectual disabilities.''
The bill deletes ""lunatic"" from Section 1 of Title 1 of the U.S. Code which states ""the words ‘insane’ and ‘insane person’ and ‘lunatic’ shall include every idiot, lunatic, insane person, and person non compos mentis.""
The Congressional Research Service summary says the bill ""removes references to the word ‘lunatic’ from rules of construction of the U.S. Code and banking law provisions concerning: (1) trust powers of banks, and (2) bank consolidations and mergers.""
University of Miami banking law professor Stanley Langbein told PolitiFact Florida that, ""By lunatics, the law means what today we would refer to as persons ‘adjudicated incompetent’ – and the person’s affairs would probably not be administered by a committee, but by what we would call a ‘guardian.’ ...  Moreover, the term ‘lunatic,’ though once commonly used in the law (the late 19th and early 20th centuries) is no longer used; when it was used, I believe it referred to a mentally disabled individual, usually what we would call a ‘special needs’ person, or more harshly a ‘mentally retarded’ person, today.""
The lone ""no"" vote was cast by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who issued a statement saying, ""Not only should we not eliminate the word 'lunatic' from federal law when the most pressing issue of the day is saving our country from bankruptcy, we should use the word to describe the people who want to continue with business as usual in Washington.""
For the record, West voted to strike the word ""lunatic,"" but he only gave it a brief mention in his final weekly newsletter, which focused more on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, foreign affairs, and the economy. And West wrote that his final weekly update as a congressman from District 22 wasn’t really his last word. (He represented District 22 but ran in District 18 due to redistricting.

"New Castle County's unemployment rate has not almost doubled in the last two years. In the Sept. 13, 2010, Delaware Senate debate between Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell, the candidates split in he-said, she-said fashion over an unemployment statistic.
O'Donnell kicked it off by charging that ""unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under (Coons') watch as New Castle County executive.""
A moment later, Coons countered, ""I also frankly can't imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I suspect we're going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth.""
One of the moderators, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, interjected, ""Let's ask her. Where did you get those numbers?""
O'Donnell responded, ""The Department of Labor statistics. And we'll have them on our web site by tomorrow.""
Sounds like a dispute tailor-made for PolitiFact: How much did unemployment rise in New Castle County, the most populous of Delaware's three counties?
Lets first clarify a few matters. In Coons' reply, he misstated the time frame O'Donnell had used, saying it was one year when in fact she had said she was looking at the past two years. We'll analyze the question using O'Donnell's criteria -- two years -- while noting that Coons garbled O'Donnell's time frame.
We also won't get into the question of whether a county executive deserves direct blame for rising unemployment, even though one can argue that unemployment is more sensitive to national and international economic factors than local ones.
For our answer, we turned to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics database at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Labor Department.
In the most recent available month, August 2010, New Castle County, Del., registered an 8.7 percent unemployment rate. Two years before, in August 2008, the rate was 5.5 percent. (The figures are not seasonally adjusted, but since we're comparing August of one year to August of another, making seasonal adjustments should be irrelevant in this comparison.)
That's a difference of 3.3 percentage points, or an increase of 58 percent over the August 2008 unemployment rate of 5.5 percent. If the rate had doubled as O'Donnell said, it would have needed to increase by 100 percent, which would have brought the unemployment rate to 11 percent today. And it clearly isn't that high.
O'Donnell did give herself some breathing room by saying that the rate ""almost"" doubled over the past two years. But while it's possible to argue that 58 percent should be rounded up to 100 percent (or ""double""), we think that's a stretch.
After we'd finished our research, we received a response from the O'Donnell campaign. A spokesman said that O'Donnell was actually referring to the rise in unemployment starting at the beginning of Coons' tenure as county executive. We confirmed with the New Castle County government that Coons, who was elected in November 2004, was inaugurated in January 2005.
So we looked at the county unemployment rate for January 2005 and found that it was 4.7 percent. That did rate roughly double by August 2010 -- but that's a period of five and a half years, not two, as O'Donnell had said in the debate. Using that time frame also measures unemployment from a point well before the economy slid into recession to a point of stubbornly high unemployment rates everywhere, so it would hardly be surprising to find the numbers rise.
As it happened, New Castle County performed better than the nation as a whole at each of these three points in time. The county's 4.7 percent unemployment rate in January 2005 was lower than the national 5.3 percent rate that month. The 5.5 percent unemployment rate in August 2008 was lower than the national rate of 6.2 percent that month, and the county's 8.7 percent in August 2010 was lower than the national rate of 9.6 percent. In fact, unemployment grew slightly more slowly in New Castle County over that period than it did nationally.
So where does this leave us? While O'Donnell is correct that unemployment has risen in New Castle County, as it has everywhere, the increase wasn't almost double over two years -- the period she said during the debate. By saying that she meant to measure it from the beginning of Coons' term as county executive, her campaign team is essentially conceding that she got the fact wrong. In our role as debate referee, we give Coons' stance that O'Donnell erred a rating of True.",1,Chris  Coons
"Says China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers. President Donald Trump floated the idea of imposing the death penalty on drug dealers in the United States during his Pennsylvania rally, saying China and Singapore do it and they don’t have a drug problem.
""The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,"" Trump said March 10 while stumping for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone. ""When you catch a drug dealer … you got to put him away for a long time.""
Trump shared conversations he had with leaders of China and Singapore.
""When I was in China and other places, by the way, I said, Mr. President, do you have a drug problem? ‘No, no, no, we do not.’ I said, Huh. Big country, 1.4 billion people, right. Not much of a drug problem. I said what do you attribute that to? ‘Well, the death penalty.’""
On Singapore, ""I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? ‘No. We don't have a problem, President.’ I said, really why? ‘We have a zero tolerance.’ And he is not playing games … So what do you mean no problem? ‘We have a zero tolerance policy.’ What does that mean? ‘That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty.’ ""
PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed. (We will set aside for now whether these countries have ""no"" drug problems as a result, as Trump claimed the leaders said.)
We found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic, smuggle or transport certain drugs. The White House did not comment on the record, but in the context of Trump’s speech, it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about ""drug dealers"" — not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets.
Nonetheless, China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices, and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States.
China’s laws
Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties.
The law mentions certain amounts of opium, heroin, methylaniline and ""other narcotic drugs of large quantities.""
Human rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown. That information is kept as a state secret . Amnesty International estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year.
Given data limitations, it's difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders.
Singapore's law
Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances. The law said the word ""traffic"" means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute.
Individuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking, unless proven otherwise. Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances.
A March 2010 study on executions, deterrence and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are ""no decent indicators"" available regarding drug use over time in Singapore, and if the data exists, ""they are a government secret.""
Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking ""as a most serious crime,"" and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore.
Singapore had eight executions for drugs from 2015 to 2017, according to a March 2018 report from Harm Reduction International.
American application
Drug policy and law experts said attempts at similar laws in the United States would face constitutional obstacles.
They pointed to a high bar for the death penalty established in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy vs. Louisiana, which addressed whether states violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing the death sentence for the crime of child rape. The court’s opinion said ""the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken.""
However, the court said its concern was limited to crimes against individual persons and did not address offenses against the State, such as treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity. Congress in 1994 enacted a law allowing the imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death occurred .
""If the death penalty is unconstitutional to impose against a child rapist, it is hard to imagine a court upholding its imposition against a person for selling drugs,"" said Alex Kreit, a law professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Law and Policy at Thomas Jefferson School of Law.
Experts also questioned how effective the death penalty would be as a deterrent for drug offenders.
""The likelihood of getting caught, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to death — especially at the federal level with only three executions since 1964 — is tiny,"" said Matthew Robinson, a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University.",1,Donald Trump
"""There's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" Skeptical voters questioned President Barack Obama about the sluggish economy at a town hall broadcast on CNBC on Sept. 20, 2010.
One of those voters was a hedge fund manager who felt that Obama was being too mean to the financial community.
""Listen, I represent the Wall Street community,"" the questioner said. ""We have felt like a piñata. Maybe you don't feel like you're whacking us with a stick, but we certainly feel like we've been whacked with a stick. So I certainly think that Main Street and Wall Street are connected, and if we're going to heal the society and make the economy better, how are we going to work towards that, healing Wall Street and Main Street?""
Obama replied that he often discusses the connection between Wall Street and Main Street. ""We need a vibrant, vital financial sector that is investing in businesses, investing in jobs, investing in our people, providing consumers loans so they can buy products -- all that is very important and we want that to thrive. But we've got to do so in a responsible way,"" he said.
""Now, I had been amused over the last couple years -- this sense of somehow me beating up on Wall Street -- I think most folks on Main Street feel like they got beat up on,"" Obama said. ""There's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street,"" he added. That's probably the majority, not the minority."" (We should note that Obama was interrupted by applause during these comments.""
We've noticed that some of Obama's political opponents repeatedly say he is anti-business, so we were intrigued by Obama's comment that ""there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" So we went out in search of data.
Interestingly, we couldn't find a poll that directly and specifically asked the public whether President Obama had been too soft or too tough on Wall Street.
But we did find one poll that was pretty close. A poll conducted in May 2010 by CBS News asked, ""Do you think the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration?""
""Too much,"" said a resounding majority of 59 percent. After that, 21 percent said they were unsure, while 12 percent said the right amount and 5 percent said too little.
We also found that most Americans favor new financial regulations that Obama signed into law in July. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in August showed 61 percent approved of the legislation , the highest of any of Obama's legislative accomplishments.
Finally, it's worth mentioning Gallup's poll from July that asked the public about its confidence in various institutions . Gallup asked which institutions merited ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence. The presidency garnered 36 percent confidence, while banks got 23 percent and ""big business"" got 19 percent. (Congress did the worst, with 11 percent.)
But polls can be contradictory, particularly when questions are asked in a different way. So we looked for data that would undermine Obama's claim.
We found one poll that indicated people might be more conflicted about government being tough on Wall Street. A poll from May asked people which of two scenarios they feared more: ""that the government will go too far in regulating financial institutions and markets, making it harder for the economy to grow, OR, that the government will not go far enough in regulating financial institutions and markets, leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis?""
Respondents split fairly evenly in this poll from Pew Research and the National Journal: 46 percent worried the government would go too far with financial regulation, while 44 percent worried government wouldn't go far enough. Another 11 percent were unsure, and the margin of error was 4 percent.
But even that fits with Obama's statement that ""there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" Obama added, ""That's probably the majority, not the minority,"" but his use of the word probably indicates he's unsure.
Here, we're checking Obama's statement that there's ""a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" We didn't find a lot of polling data on this question. The question that addresses it most closely was whether ""the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration."" The resounding answer to that was yes, they have too much influence.",1,Barack Obama
"""You know, the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent."" Sen. John McCain has been a member of the U.S. Congress since 1982, but as he runs for president, he's putting as much rhetorical distance between himself and his Capitol Hill colleagues as possible.
While defending his support for a gas tax holiday in a June 18, 2008, interview, McCain tarred his fellow members of Congress as ""rather wealthy"" folks who are ""out of touch"" with the needs and fears of working people on fixed incomes.
""You know, the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent,"" he said. ""Maybe they ought to pay a little more attention to their constituents.""
On June 11, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll awarded Congress a 13 percent approval rating. And that's the same figure McCain offered. During roughly the same time period, Gallup, Fox News and AP/Ipsos all conducted polls which put the approval rating at 19, 19 and 23 percent respectively.
All had margins of error of between 3 and 4 percentage points.
When Democrats took slim control of Congress in early 2007, there was a brief honeymoon, but approval has steadily dropped, said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
Thanks in part to its relatively faceless quality, Congress makes a convenient whipping boy when the nation is dissatisfied, Keeter said. (The same Gallup poll that put Congress at 19 percent found that 30 percent of respondents approved of President George W. Bush.)
And dissatisfied we are. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal approval rating of 13 percent was a record low for the poll, besting a 15 percent rating in April 1992.
Though the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll is slightly out of step with others recently conducted, it's highly reputable and there's no way to prove the figure false, Keeter said. And anyway, he said, whether it's 13 percent or 23 percent, it's not good news for Congress.
McCain may have chosen the poll figure that most dramatically made his point, but the numbers are as good as any and the overall picture he presented — that of a public overwhelmingly displeased with Congress — is right on.
We rule his statement True.",1,John McCain
"""The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag."" The first presidential debate focused on the economy and foreign affairs, and Barack Obama and John McCain discussed a broad range of topics that included the economic bailout, the Iraq war and . . . whether South Koreans are taller than North Koreans.
McCain called North Korea the ""most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag."" (That statement occurs about 1:00 into the accompanying video.)
We've examined a lot of unlikely facts in this campaign, including the cooking of squirrels and the regulation of ham and cheese sandwiches , but this was a new one to us. So we did some checking and found that McCain is right. South Koreans are, indeed, taller than North Koreans.
In his study
Height and weight differences between North and South Korea,
Daniel Schwekendiek, an economist from the University of Tuebingen in Germany, compared 2002 data that showed preschool children in North Korea were up to 5 inches shorter and up to 14 pounds lighter than children who were brought up in South Korea.
A 2006 study of 1,075 North Korean defectors aged 20 to 39 put the difference for adults at 4 inches for men and 2.5 inches for women. A 2004 study said the difference was 2.3 inches for young men and 1.6 inches for young women.
The studies blame malnutrition in North Korea for the height difference.
So McCain is on solid ground with his claim. The studies vary, but his 3-inch claim is a reasonable approximation of the various studies and his underlying point is correct.",1,John McCain
"""Palin (proposed) a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf."" In a jarring television advertisement, the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund attempts to show a less friendly side of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin by noting how the Alaska governor championed an intensive predator management program.
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
For this item, we'll focus on this part of the ad: “And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf.”
“The cruelty” in question was a state-sanctioned hunt intended to thin out the wolf population. Indeed, Palin’s administration announced the $150 bounty for the “left forelegs of wolves” as part of a larger effort to reduce wolf populations in five areas of the state, according to a press release from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game dated March 21, 2007. The payments are made to volunteer pilots and shooters who are permitted to track and kill predators in the winter months. State biologists planned to use the forelegs as specimens to study the wolf population.
Department spokesman Tim Barry said the idea came from state biologists and Palin’s office played a key role in developing the cash incentive program. Proposals of this nature ultimately are approved by the state’s Board of Game, which is appointed by the governor’s office.
The release contends the payment isn’t a “bounty,” but that’s a matter of semantics. An Alaskan judge who later declared the payments illegal called it a “bounty, pure and simple” in his ruling. In fact, the Defenders of Wildlife Action, which made this ad, was among the conservation groups that took Alaska to court over the incentive program.
What’s missing from the campaign ad is the context about wildlife management in Alaska, and the history of the program.
Unlike other areas where wolves are protected, Alaska officials estimate the state’s vast wilderness holds 7,000 to 11,000 wolves. These elusive predators hunt moose and caribou, which are favorite targets for hunters seeking food and sport in Alaska. In 2003, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski initiated the program to manage the wolf population.
In 2007, the state wanted to kill between 382 and 664 wolves, but the nearly 200 permitted hunters had shot only about 100 wolves as the hunting season neared its April 30 end. High fuel prices and limited snowfall made it hard to track the animals, so Palin’s administration offered the $150 per wolf as an extra incentive “to motivate permittees to redouble their efforts and to help offset the high cost of aviation fuel,” the release states.
The organization behind the ad, along with other environmental groups, filed a lawsuit to stop the payments because wildlife bounties were outlawed in 1984. About 40 wolves were killed after the bounty was offered, but the payments were never made to hunters. The judge struck down the incentive program 10 days after it was announced, Barry said. The advertisement is intended to shock viewers by presenting Palin without the context of political life in frontier Alaska, where wildlife management is a high-profile government function. But the facts are right and the missing context has more to do with sensibilities than factual accuracy.",1,Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund
"When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he ""stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills.’"" Energy policy and gas prices garnered a lot of attention in the town-hall style debate between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney.
Romney accused Obama of stifling domestic production and said he would champion the oil and coal industries. Obama fired back that Romney hasn’t always been such a proponent of coal.
""Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills,’ and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal,"" Obama said. PolitiFact Ohio has looked into this bit of Bay State history before, rating a statement similar to this one. We’ll recap.
The Salem Harbor Power Station
Back on Feb. 5, 2003, Romney made several statements during a showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station, in the Boston area.
A couple of years earlier, Massachusetts had passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. As governor, Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.
Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the ""Filthy Five"" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.
Local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenues) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.
But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too.
The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004 and appeared at a press conference near the plant to emphasize the point.
His statements that day show how he felt, and they’re documented in this video : ""I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant -- that plant kills people.""",1,Barack Obama
"In July 1996, Mitt Romney helped locate the missing teenage daughter of a partner at Bain Capital. A number of readers recently have asked us to fact-check a story about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The story, currently circulating on email, Facebook, and blogs, says that Romney helped a colleague of his at Bain Capital locate his missing teenage daughter.
""In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared,"" the story reads. ""She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay’s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York and asked them to help find his friend’s missing daughter. Romney’s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could – prostitutes, drug addicts – anyone.
""That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney’s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter’s life, saying, ‘It was the most amazing thing, and I’ll never forget this to the day I die.’
""So, here’s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can’t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn’t do it for self-aggrandizement or for personal gain. He does it because that’s just how he’s wired.""
We can’t speak to what this episode says about Romney’s deeper character, but we can verify the facts of the episode. In fact, we did so when this story came up during the 2008 presidential election season.
Back then, the story was circulating because of television ad created by Romney’s campaign. It featured Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite him with his daughter.
As we reported then, based on contemporary news reports, the girl sneaked away on July 6, 1996, to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy. She had told her parents she was playing tennis.
When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa.
Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort.
According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teen-aged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11.
Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police told PolitiFact four years ago that police reports do not mention Romney personally. But Peterson, as well as reports at the time, agreed that the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl.
""The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on Channel 7 and called in,"" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station.
Gay says Romney helped ""save"" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. The line in the retelling now circulating -- that doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day -- comes from a Boston Globe report in 2002.
Newsday, for its part, reported in July 1996 that ""Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ...""
""She was not harmed,"" Robert Gay said at news conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News. ""She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home.""
By all accounts, the effort by Bain employees was central to the effort to locate the girl, and Romney reportedly played a significant role in that effort. We give the account now circulating a rating of True.",1,Chain email
"Says Bernie Sanders ""has reversed his position on immunity"" for gun manufacturers and sellers. In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers, sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits.
Now, after Sanders clarified his position on the issue, she’s calling him a flip-flopper.
Sanders, who represents the small, rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control. One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill, which was enacted in 2005 . A similar bill also passed the U.S. House in 2003 . Sanders, then serving in the House, voted for it both times.
Clinton called on Sanders to ""stand up and say I got this one wrong"" in a Jan. 8 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball.
About a week later, Sanders released a statement on the gun-liability issue in the run-up to the Jan. 17 Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. In a news release , Sanders said, ""I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,"" referring to proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to rescind portions of the 2005 law.
""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders added.
The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip-flop during the Charleston debate. Clinton said, ""I am pleased to hear that Sen. Sanders has reversed his position on immunity, and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation.""
The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC, ""This is not a flip flop, this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign.""
So is Clinton’s portrayal accurate? We took a closer look.
Sanders’ vote on the 2005 bill
While the bill includes two relatively non-controversial provisions -- one on trigger locks and the other on armor-piercing bullets -- the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill, and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time, deal with liability for gun makers and sellers.
The official bill summary provides for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also provides a few exceptions, such as:
• Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug-trafficking crime will be committed with it;
• Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law;
• And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended.
What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan. 16
On numerous occasions, Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote.
In June 2015, Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, told Politico , ""I believe he would make the same vote"" today.
In October, at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Sanders said , ""If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about.""
Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016. Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths, Sanders said, ""Of course not, that doesn't make any sense,"" he said, while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals, ""Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable.""
At the same time, Sanders has increasingly fine-tuned his stance, saying he’d be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure.
In an October 2015 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders said he was ""willing to see changes"" in the gun-liability provision: ""Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes.""
Then, in January, a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability, Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, ""I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly.""
The Jan. 16 news release
In the news release, Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal-Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law. The trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions would not be overturned. The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill, according to the New York Times.
On the Jan. 17 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders explained that in 2005, ""there were things in (the bill) that I did not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it.""
Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. This, he indicated, was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont.",1,Hillary Clinton
"CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night. Following this year’s Thanksgiving dinner, a lone Twitter profile alleged that CNN was serving up something difficult to stomach — a half-hour of hardcore pornography. Apparently starved for content, the media ate it up.
Around 10:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 24, 2016, Twitter user @solikearose tweeted from Boston that the scheduled episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown was not appearing on CNN. She said there was an explicit sex scene showing on the network, instead.
The user shared several images with TiVo digital programming information included, tagging from Boston-area cable provider RCN.
(Image via Mediaite )
Twitter being Twitter, rumors of explicit sex on a cable news channel spread quickly. Other users included the hashtag "" #BourdainPorn "" while sharing the images and discussing the alleged incident.
By 9:54 a.m. ET the next day, cable provider RCN responded to the tweets . They said there had been no similar reports of pornography shown on CNN.
At some point, major media outlets picked up on the subject and started posting stories based on @solikearose’s tweets. It’s not exactly clear what media outlet first wrote up a story, because so many have since edited their postings. ( The Verge contends it was the U.K.’s  Independent , which was then sent out by The Drudge Report with a tweet that read, ""CNN accidentally airs 30 minutes of trans porn…"")
Other outlets that wrote posts about the supposed network nookie included the  Daily Mail , Fox News , The Wrap ,  Esquire ,  Maxim , the  New York Post , the New York Daily News and more, on down to smaller sites like Sputnik News and RT.com .
The porn star in the photos, whom Twitter users identified as Riley Quinn, acknowledged the alleged exposure on Twitter .
Variety even quoted a CNN representative as saying the event indeed happened. ""The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.""
But while the story was shared far and wide in less than a day, it appeared by Friday evening that no one else had witnessed the same thing @solikearose had.
On Friday evening, BuzzFeed News posted an interview with the purported original Twitter user , whom they only identified as a Boston woman named Rose.
""I initially posted because I wanted to see if anyone else in Boston had been affected,"" she said. ""I think it was a broadcasting error that affected only my house.""
The person BuzzFeed News interviewed assured the site that the incident was real, and that she had conversed with a customer service representative who advised her to restart her digital cable converter. The pornography then stopped, she said. She said had made her Twitter account private because she had been harassed online.
BuzzFeed News quoted RCN Boston general manager Jeff Carlson as saying there had been no other complaints about the event.
The account @solikearose has since been deleted , and most of the posts on the incident have since been updated, many of them calling the incident a ""hoax.""
When we contacted CNN, the network gave us the same response it gave other outlets on Nov. 25: ""Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN’s programming in the Boston area last night.""
CNN also noted to us that while many media outlets referred to the network airing the footage, the CNN feed is the same nationwide. That means every market gets the same programming, and any difference would be through the local cable provider.
Shortly after the BuzzFeed News interview was posted, RCN wrote on their Facebook page about the flap. When we contacted RCN, they referred us to the same statement, attributing it to Carlson.",0,Bloggers
"""Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal."" President Donald Trump repeated a viral claim from conservative media that President Barack Obama granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, as part of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in 2015.
""Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal,"" said a July 2 headline on Diamond and Silk , who are pro-Trump activists.
Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)
The story was largely lifted from Fox News and repeated by Trump and other websites.
""Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?"" tweeted Trump, who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.
We found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at Factnameh , a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up.
Factnameh.com found that the original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called Amad News. It published the claim on Feb. 14, 2017, quoting an anonymous ""informed source.""
Fox News attributed report to one Iranian official
Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee.
Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency, a ""semi-official"" organ of the Iranian government.
Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said.
""When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,"" he claimed.
Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, ""This sounds like totally made up B.S.""
Other officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false .
Richard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department’s lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim ""is entirely nonsense.""
""It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship,"" he said. ""While I was on the team, this wasn't even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you'd care to wager that this didn't come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that's because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it.""
Suzanne Maloney , deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State’s Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama’s administration.)
Maloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period.
There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship.
""Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism,"" she said.
Zolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said.
""So it’s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump’s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement,"" Maloney said. ""And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S.""
Ali Vaez, the anti-war Crisis Group's Iran Project Director , told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims.
Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government.

"""The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things."" How can the United States and Iran come to a deal on Iran’s nuclear program when the two countries can’t even agree on what they supposedly agreed to?
That’s the point presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -- a vocal critic of the negotiations -- made on National Public Radio April 13 .
""I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable,"" he said. ""The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things.""
President Barack Obama and the other negotiating parties -- Iran, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany -- hit a milestone in early April. They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal, to be reached in the summer. So we wondered: Are the United States and Iran’s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different?
It’s important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, was a framework, not a final deal. The framework itself isn’t publicly available, and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out. For these reasons, there’s room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents.
Even so, some of the differences between the United States’ and Iran’s descriptions of the agreement are significant -- such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Back in April, Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside, hoping to successfully address them later, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy.
""These differences are important, however, and could very well kill the deal,"" Kroenig said.
Officials in both countries have said the other’s descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne, and if they can’t agree, the potential for a deal might die.
Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was ""in contradiction"" to the framework agreement, according to the New York Times.
Responding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s pushback against the deal, Obama told reporters April 11 , ""If that is his understanding and his position -- in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation -- then we're probably not going to get a deal.""
Significant discrepancies
We reached out to Rubio’s team and didn’t hear back. But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement, in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties. If you want to look at the details yourself, Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together a side-by-side comparison of all three fact sheets and relevant political statements.
A major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran.
According to the American factsheet, the United States and European Union will ""suspend"" sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions can ""snap back"" into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying.
Iran’s summary, on the other hand, says the sanctions will be ""revoked"" as soon as the deal is implemented -- distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said April 4 , ""During the talks we (both sides) always talked about lifting economic, financial, and banking sanctions. We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions, and if that were the case, no agreement would form.""
Additionally, Obama said the sanctions relief would be ""phased in,"" while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the ""very first day of the implementation of the deal.""
Another point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities.
The American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectors will have near universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama called it ""unprecedented,"" noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves.
Iran’s summary of the framework says much less about verification processes. It says Iran will comply with some of the agency’s protocols ""on a voluntary and temporary basis."" Additionally, Iran’s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities.
""It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the country’s defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections,"" Khamenei said, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.
While the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important, others are a just matter of spin, said Graham Allison, director of Harvard’s Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst.
For example, regarding one of Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities, the United States factsheet says, ""Almost two-thirds of Fordow’s centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed."" Iran’s factsheet, on the other hand says, ""More than 1,000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained.""
Both descriptions are accurate -- Fordow currently has 2,710 centrifuges, and the deal will lower that number to 1,044.
While the differences in the public descriptions may be striking, Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet, given that the real negotiations are conducted in private, meaning the real contents of the deal are private, too.
""Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on, and even exaggerate, these differences for their own political ends,"" Allison said.",1,Marco Rubio
"""It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education."" Fiscal conservatives have dreamed of abolishing the Department of Education since President Jimmy Carter created it in 1980. Ronald Reagan ran that year against Carter, pledging to kill it. After he failed to follow through, leading Republicans sponsored legislation to do the job in 1995, arguing that states should oversee education policy. But they couldn't persuade enough of their colleagues to go along.
For a budget hawk like Ron Paul, that failure is particularly galling, especially considering the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency starting in 2001. During that time, the Education Department has  lived on — and enjoyed sizable budget increases.
At a debate in Iowa on Dec. 12, 2007, Des Moines Register editor Carolyn Washburn gave Paul an opening to raise the issue: ""What's the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education in the United States? And how would you address it?""
The ""federal government,"" Paul said, adding that — to his dismay — ""It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something so we double the size of the Department of Education.""
In fact, Paul understates the shift. The size of the Education Department nearly quadrupled between 1994 and 2006, increasing from $27-billion to $100-billion.  Even when adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase is huge: nearly triple (172 percent).
Much of the increase came as a result of  the 2001 education law known as the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds.
We should point out that federal funding contributes a small portion to education funding for grades K-12. Even under the No Child law, states and localities contribute 83 percent of K-12 education funding. The federal contribution is 8 percent; private sources provide 9 percent, according to Education Department calculations.
The $100-billion budget in 2006 was by far the largest ever, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5-billion. In 2007, the budget fell to $67.4-billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big but not quite double.
The bump in 2006 was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3-billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year.
But whether the spending is mandatory or discretionary, Paul, a libertarian who does not believe the federal government has a role to play in education policy, says it's better left to the states. Many of his Republican colleagues, as evidenced by the $73-billion increase in funding the Education Department enjoyed while they controlled Congress and the White House, apparently do not agree. Paul's statement, therefore, is True.",1,Ron Paul
"California's credit rating is ""the worst in the country."" Compared to the drama in the California gubernatorial Republican primary, Jerry Brown's campaign for governor can seem a little low-key. Still, Brown is the Democratic challenger, so PolitiFact decided to check out his website.
In his welcome video, the former governor and current attorney general of California outlined the problems he sees plaguing the state.
""It's no secret that Sacramento isn't working today. The partisanship is poisonous. Political posturing has replaced leadership. And the budget: It's always late, it's always in the red, and it's always wrong. Today the political breakdown in Sacramento is threatening jobs, our schools, and the state's credit rating, which is the worst in the country. Our state is in serious trouble, and the next governor must have the preparation, and the knowledge, and the know-how to get California working again.""
We were curious about his claim about credit ratings. Are they really the lowest of all the states?
Just as individuals borrow money to buy a car or a house, states like California borrow money to fund their budget and projects. One way that they do this is by issuing General Obligation bonds. And just as a bank tries to determine the likelihood that an individual will pay back a loan, plus interest, on time, credit rating agencies try to determine if states will pay back the money they borrow, plus interest, on time.
""The rating on a bond answers a very simple question with an often complicated answer: how likely is this issuer (California) to not make good on its debt,"" said Satya Thallam, associate director of economic education at the George Mason University's Mercatus Center. In the spectrum of bonds, G.O. bonds tend to be the lowest risk because they are not tied to any specific revenue stream, but are backed by the ""full faith and credit"" of the issuer, he said. That means California promises to use all tools at its disposal, including tax increases, to pay the loan on time.
The three biggest U.S. credit rating agencies -- Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch -- have all given California's G.O. bonds the lowest ratings of any state.
• Standard and Poor's: Gave California an A- rating with a negative outlook Their rating starts at AAA, then AA, A, then BBB and so forth down to D.
• Fitch: Recently gave California an A- with a stable outlook.
• Moody's: At the time Brown made the claim, California was alone in the cellar of Moody's ratings among states. But the agency recently downgraded Illinois to the same level. Moody's uses a slightly different rating system. Its highest rating is Aaa, then Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, A2, A3, Baa1 and so forth down to C. California and Illinois are rated A1.
But none of these ratings are quite as bad as they sound.
Gabriel Petek, the primary author of S&P's report on the California GO Bond rating, said that the ""A-"" rating is still strong in the ""grand scheme of the rating universe. But relatively speaking, the risks seems incrementally greater to us"" compared to other states.
Still, why are California's bonds riskier than those of other states?
Two of the biggest problems are institutional constraints and partisan politicking. In California, the legislature requires a two-thirds majority to pass a budget and to raise taxes. That makes passing a budget, let alone a balanced one, very difficult, because the minority party, which has more than one-third of the votes, has a great deal of leverage. Furthermore, the state constitution requires that the legislature spend at least 40 percent of the budget on education, which further decreases legislative flexibility.
As a result, it is not uncommon for the budget to be passed late, leaving the state short of cash. In 2009, California started issuing IOUs to ""non priority payees"" such as tax refund recipients, in order to be able to continue reimbursing for G.O. bonds. Petek said that those IOUs were good and bad: ""The ability of the controller to issue IOUs when cash is or is expected to become unacceptably low both protects the state's credit quality, and at the same time illustrates that the state's budget and cash problems have reached a fairly serious point.""
California is also feeling the bite of the recession more than many other states because it derives 50 percent of its revenue from income taxes, much of it from capital gains taxes. So when the stock market took a sharp dip, so did California's revenue.
Brown was right about California having the lowest credit rating. Illinois' recent descent to California's level in Moody's ratings happened after Brown's post, so we are not counting that in our assessment.",1,Jerry Brown
"""Look, I believe in accountability. In 1983, I led the effort in Arkansas to improve our schools."" In responding to a question about testing from education, Sen. Hillary Clinton said she ""led the effort"" to improve Arkansas schools in 1983.
It might seem an easy fact to prove. But 24-year-old records from Arkansas don't pop up on the Internet, and folks from the state's Department of Education apologized that someone apparently had thrown out the supporting documents.
So we turned to press clippings from the time, and to the folks who were there.
They unequivocally state that Clinton, who was Arkansas First Lady at the time, did chair the state's 1983 Education Standards Committee at a time when Arkansas was trying to move up from the bottom of the nation's many school-related rankings, from student performance to teacher pay.
After meetings in all 75 counties, the committee made several recommendations. These included raising the dropout age, requiring all high schools to offer advanced math and science courses, and mandating smaller class sizes. To pay for the changes, it also proposed a sales tax increase.
And to win support for these ideas, Clinton and her husband, then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, called for competency tests for all teachers — something the teachers hated but the public loved.
""Over and over again I was asked, 'What are you going to do about all the incompetent teachers?'"" Mrs. Clinton told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1984.
The initiatives won resounding approval in a special session of the Legislature in late 1983.
But was Mrs. Clinton a chairwoman in name only? Or was she truly the change agent?
""She shepherded it through and was absolutely instrumental in getting it approved through the legislative process and accepted in general by the public,"" said Peggy Nabors, president of the state teachers union at the time, who now is leaning toward supporting Clinton for president.
The state has made many education reforms since, and its national ranking has risen to the middle of the pack. Arkansas School Boards Association executive director Dan Farley, a Clinton backer, said the 1983 initiative lit the flame for such changes in a state that didn't have education on its front burner before.
""We still have a way to go,"" he said. ""But the earliest flickering started then.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"""San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies"" because they went on strike. Conservative news outlets have been spreading a false story online that wrongly says aid to Hurricane Maria victims isn’t being distributed in Puerto Rico because union truck drivers have gone on strike.
The headline on a Sept. 30, 2017, post on The Gateway Pundit read, ""San Juan Teamsters didn’t show up for work to distribute relief supplies — U.S. aid rotting at ports.""
Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. Similar headlines appeared on several other links that users questioned .
The post claimed that while the ""liberal media"" is attacking President Donald Trump’s response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that ""the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies,"" The Gateway Pundit said.
The other posts all shared the same sentiment, and often included ""proof"" from more social media posts claiming to know all about the problem .
But they aren’t right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem.
Sites are picking and choosing details
The Gateway Pundit pointed to another Sept. 30 post from TheConservativeTreehouse.com , which cited a Sept. 29 Huffington Post interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Michael A. Valle. Valle was born in Puerto Rico and was leading Maria relief efforts.
The Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island.
""It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,"" the website quoted Valle as saying. ""Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.""
Valle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved ""zero blame:""
""They can’t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can’t get fuel themselves, and they can’t call us for help because there’s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family’s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can’t call home.""
The Conservative Treehouse also posted a video of CNBC’s Contessa Brewer reporting from San Juan as proof of the problem, but ignored the part where Brewer said transportation problems are not the drivers’ fault.
""You’re looking at truck drivers who can’t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don’t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don’t have fuel,"" Brewer said. ""The problem is the supply chain.""
She added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge.
There has been a definite problem moving supplies that have arrived . On Sept. 29, the same day Valle’s interview was published, the Teamsters sent out a press release asking union truck drivers to volunteer to go to Puerto Rico to help transport supplies. The release warned that it wouldn’t be easy, but fellow union workers needed help.
""At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,"" the release read. ""However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs.""
There’s no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle’s interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union.
The blog turned to a Spanish-language interview for Lo Sé Todo on Wapa.tv with Victor Rodriguez, identifying as ""the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker’s union called Fente Amplio.""
Dozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters.
TheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez’s interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico’s governor.
""Since the country doesn’t care about truckers, the truckers won’t help,"" TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance.
In truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said.
Rodriguez did take a swipe at Rosselló, saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can’t come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods. He even cuts off the reporter at one point for suggesting they are refusing to work.
In response to all the false stories online blaming Teamster drivers, the union released a statement on Oct. 2 that said their members have been working since Maria passed over the island. The statement blamed ""online, anti-union sources"" for spreading an inaccurate story.
""These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda,"" Teamsters president Jim Hoffa said in the release. ""The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are (in) dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature.""",0,Bloggers
"""Less than four cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health."" This year's Democratic platform sets a goal of providing more affordable health care. One way to attack medical costs is to prevent chronic illness through less expensive preventive care, although the subject is ripe for academic dispute.
The platform states: ""Yet despite all of this, less than four cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health.""
This is true.
A report in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 3 percent of total health expenditures went toward preventative health care.
The 1992 report looked at figures from the Health Care Financing Administration about the costs of different kinds of health care. The authors included spending that either reduced disease and injury or enhanced health.
The small percentage from that long-ago report is still widely repeated. An article May 28, 2008, in the Journal of the American Medical Association about preventive medicine refers for cost estimates to an article in the Harvard Health Policy Review in fall 2006, which cites the 1992 report.
The Harvard publication also mentions a 2006 article in Health Affairs by former surgeon general David Satcher that estimated spending on preventive care at less than 2 percent.
In 2004 testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Dr. Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco and founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, described how three-quarters of health-care spending goes toward chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. But he said less than 2 percent was spent on preventing those ailments.
We should note, we're not ruling on whether preventive care is cost effective, but rather on the specific claim that we're currently spending only 4 percent on it.
We would like to be using figures more recent than 1992, but that appears to be the last time researchers used government figures to calculate the percentage of health care spending that goes to prevention. With that in mind, we have to say the Democratic Party platform claim is True.",1,Democratic National Committee
"""She flunked the D.C. bar exam."" In an article for a conservative Internet journal that has been widely distributed via chain e-mail, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris points out a little-known embarrassment about Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was a star law student at Yale.
""She flunked the D.C. bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar,"" he wrote.
It's true.
In his biography of Hillary Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein notes that in the summer of 1973, 817 people took the Washington, D.C., bar exam; 551 of them passed. Hillary Rodham was not one of them.
""For the first time in her life she had flamed out — spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her, and even more so her own,"" Bernstein wrote.
Bernstein said Clinton kept the news hidden for 30 years and shocked some of her closest friends when she made the revelation with a passing reference in her 2003 autobiography, Living History. She even spins it into a positive.
""Despite the satisfaction of my work, I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand,"" she wrote. ""I had taken both the Arkansas and Washington, D.C., bar exams during the summer, but my heart was pulling me toward Arkansas. When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought that maybe my test scores were telling me something.""
So she followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas. She became a faculty member in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, where Bill Clinton also taught. And in 1975, the two married.
Wrote Bernstein: ""There can only be conjecture about what turn her life — and the nation's — might have taken had she not failed the exam.""
But she did, and this statement is True.",1,Chain email
"""I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities."" In a town hall in St. Petersburg, Fla., an audience member challenged Obama about speaking out on issues affecting the black community, including the subprime mortgage crisis, among other issues.
""Why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited African community or the black community in this country?"" the man asked.
Not true, Obama replied. ""I think you're misinformed about when you say not one time. Every issue you've spoken about, I actually did speak out on,"" Obama said.
""I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities,"" Obama said. He went on to defend his record on other civil rights issues.
We wondered if Obama's statement on the subprime mortgage was true, so we looked through press releases, transcripts and news stories to find out.
Most notably, on Oct. 18, 2007, Obama wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to investigate subprime lenders to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination.
Obama wrote in his leter that there was already substantial evidence to indicate this was so.
""Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue,"" Obama wrote.
On the campaign trail, Obama has also discussed the same issue several times, though we found most of our examples of him discussing it before Hispanic audiences.
On June 28, 2008, Obama told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, ""We have to stabilize the housing market. And the Latino community as well as the African-American community was particularly hard hit when it comes to foreclosures.""
On Feb. 19, 2008, Obama was at a campaign event in San Antonio, Texas, and discussed the need for people having mortgage problems to receive help negotiating with their lenders.  ""My suspicion is that it's very important we have Spanish-speaking counselors because I know that both the African-American community and Hispanic community have been disproportionately targeted by some of these practices.""
It's not a campaign theme he hits over and over again, but Obama has made the statement several times, and the 2007 letter is particularly strong evidence to bolster Obama's argument. We rule his statement True.",1,Barack Obama

Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, told PolitiFact that the institute’s data produces the following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line are statistically tied.
1-2: 2010, 2005
3-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009
9-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 2004
13: 2008
14: 1997
15: 1995
This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13.
We see a few other issues to note.
• The NASA data set isn’t the only one available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The two measurements diverge somewhat -- NOAA considers 2012 the 10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, rather than the ninth.
However, NOAA’s data for land and ocean temperature anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest on record.
• There are other ways one could measure ""hottest years."" Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global mean surface temperature. ""One could define ‘hottest’ in other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is,"" he said.",1,Barack Obama
"""The claim ... that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to   kill off senior citizens ... is a lie, plain and simple."" In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama brought up the most explosive charge to emerge in the health care debate: the specter of ""death panels.""
""Some of people’s concerns (about the health care legislation) have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost,"" Obama told lawmakers and a national television audience on Sept. 9, 2009. ""The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.""
The president was referring to a notion most prominently raised by former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin in a note posted on her Facebook page on Aug. 7, 2009.
""And who will suffer the most when they ration care?"" Palin wrote. ""The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.""
We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's ""level of productivity in society"" to determine whether someone is ""worthy"" of health care. When we first assessed Palin's claim on Aug. 7, 2009, we gave it our lowest rating — Pants on Fire.
Palin may have jumped to a conclusion about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for ""worthiness."" Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others.
The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall ""conduct, support, and synthesize research"" that looks at ""outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically.""
The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research.
The House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission that ""nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer."" In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select.
Nothing has emerged to suggest to us that the death panels claim is any more true today than it was when Palin first floated it. We still rate it as Pants on Fire today. In our book, that counts as a ""lie, plain and simple.",1,Barack Obama
"""(Hillary Clinton's State Department) actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn’t using the proper server."" Hillary Clinton, already facing a congressional inquiry about the personal email account she used as secretary of state, could be facing another federal investigation by President Barack Obama’s Justice Department.
Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called the Justice Department’s potential review into whether classified information was mishandled ""damning"" before charging Clinton with hypocrisy.
""Even she knew there was a rule,"" Paul said July 26 . ""They actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn't using the proper server. I don't understand how she can skate by and act as if she wasn't aware of the law.""
We won’t address here whether Clinton was or wasn’t ""aware of the law."" But we were curious about Paul’s allegation: Did the State Department under Clinton chide a diplomat for handling email on an improper server in the same way as Clinton?
The Clinton campaign declined to comment.
The ambassador
A spokeswoman for Paul told us he was referring to Scott Gration, a former Obama advisor who left his post as ambassador to Kenya three years ago.
After less than a year and half on the job, Gration resigned in June 2012 (while Clinton was secretary) after reading a draft of a highly critical audit by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General, which works independently . Among Gration’s many failings was his continued usage of a personal email account, according to the report.
Unsurprisingly, Gration’s drama resurfaced when the Clinton email controversy first erupted in March 2015, and some claimed that Gration was fired for his "" Hillary-like"" use of the email . (Gration used a Gmail account.) Gration himself called the State Department’s treatment of him a double standard.
PunditFact, however, found that most of the reports inflated the significance of the personal email. Gration’s grating style of management, uncooperative attitude and ""disruptive"" initiatives were more pressing to the State Department. Out of more than 80 mission chiefs, he ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on managerial skill and attention to morale, and third to last on overall scores, according to the audit.
Compared to these issues, the email problem played a minor role, according to Ronald Neumann, who served as an American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005-07.
""It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it’s hard to get through to that one,"" Neumann told PunditFact .
The admonishment
Paul’s claim, however, is more tempered, and thus more accurate. That audit did indeed ""admonish"" Gration for his email habits. The fourth bullet point on the report’s summary reads:
""The Ambassador’s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite.""
The report describes Gration’s actions in detail starting on page 43 : He deliberately defied the State Department’s rule on communication by installing a commercial Internet connection in his embassy office bathroom and authorizing his embassy staff to use personal emails.
""He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,"" the report says .
Ars Technica , a technology news site, put it even more bluntly: ""Gration was the end user from hell for an understaffed IT team in a politically sensitive outpost.""
The report also spells out the reasons for the policy: Unauthorized systems increase the risk for hacks and loss of records. It then states that the use of personal emails ""must be limited to maintaining communications during emergencies"" and recommended the embassy stop using the unofficial email accounts.
It is unclear if top State Department brass slammed Gration for violating the personal email policy, as Paul suggests. We found no on-the-record condemnations from department officials, though Gration said multiple times that Clinton’s chief of staff fired him after reading the report. An audit by an inspector general is different than Clinton directly criticizing Gration for the practice.
Comparison to Clinton
In short, the department’s watchdogs chided Gration for a number of issues, including his personal email use. But how closely did his improper email habits mirror Clinton’s?
Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her tenure as the country’s top diplomat. At the time, there was no law prohibiting the practice (one was put in place in 2014). There was, however, a long-standing policy against using personal emails, reiterated in a 2011 memo from the State Department under Clinton. Gration, for his part, used both, although he ""very infrequently"" logged onto his classified account, the report says.
Without more information, it’s hard to compare the security risks of both setups. Gration likely channeled his personal emails through an unsecured Internet connection despite repeated warnings, according to the  Washington Post .
As for Clinton, her personal email was relayed through a private server guarded by the Secret Service, Clinton said at a March press conference . We don’t know if the State Department signed off on her private server, but it was aware of the server’s existence. The emails were encrypted after March 2009, according to her security provider , though there’s still debate over the account’s security.
Overall, an expert told us it’s an apples-to-apples comparison, though he cautioned that the inspector general report does not address why Gration was using a personal email. ( According to Gration, he couldn’t get news alerts through the official State Department server.)
""The similarities between the two situations are striking, and it is fair to compare them,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at the City University of New York, who studies records preservation. ""Both were in senior leadership positions. Both made a regrettable decision to use non-official email, which raised security and record-keeping concerns that should have been obvious. And both refused to accept that their continuous use of non-official email violated State Department rules.""
Cox pointed out that the report condemned Gration’s email usage as a failure in leadership that ""sapped the morale"" of his staff. The same criticism could apply to Clinton, who, as secretary of state, should be held to a higher standard than Gration, Cox argued.
""The buck should have stopped with her, and she should have been leading by example,"" he said.",1,Rand Paul
"Under President Barack Obama’s jobs bill, ""you can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed."" During the Sept. 13, 2011, edition of Sean Hannity’s show on the Fox News Channel, Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s jobs bill included a new way for Americans to sue for discrimination.
In a discussion with former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden and Tucker Carlson, the editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, Hannity said that, under the bill, unemployed people would be able to sue for discrimination if they felt their status had kept them from getting a job.
""There is a class where they could sue the employer they've interviewed with because they were discriminated against, because they were unemployed,"" Hannity said. ""If I'm an employer and they implement that, I'm not going to interview anybody.""
Carlson added, ""There's a new category to the Civil Rights Act with race, ethnicity.""
Hannity continued, ""You can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed.""
Carlson replied that such a provision was a ""giveaway to the trial lawyers.""
""We've gone entitlement crazy,"" Bowden said.
""We have,"" Hannity agreed.
We were curious about whether Hannity described the proposal correctly. We began by turning to the bill itself.
The provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they’re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed.
Since unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that ""denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory.""
Specifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual ""because of the individual's status as unemployed."" The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies.
As for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that ""a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.
An individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, ""may be awarded, as appropriate"" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, ""reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice,"" damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and ""reasonable attorney’s fees.""
Lynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation.
""Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed,"" Bernabei said. ""Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context.""
But Hannity didn’t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue.",1,Sean Hannity
"""When the Republicans were in charge, they actually expanded government health care with the prescription drug program."" Years before ""Obamacare,"" congressional Republicans saw political gold in expanding government's role in health care by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says the ""Part D"" drug benefit is a reminder that the GOP sometimes can't resist the temptation of big government.
""I'm not all that optimistic (about repealing the Democratic health care law) because when we did have the chance, when the Republicans were in charge, they actually expanded government health care with the prescription drug program,"" Paul said in a July 16, 2011, interview with the Nashua Telegraph in Derry, New Hampshire. ""We've got a long way to go on that.""
Because memories can be short, we thought it would be worthwhile to explore whether Paul was right that the GOP was responsible for such a big increase in government.
A bit of background: The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 was an effort by President George W. Bush in his first term to address a major gap in the senior citizen health care program -- a lack of drug coverage. Bush's political advisers saw the drug plan as a way for Bush to broaden his appeal with seniors.
Early on, the drug benefit had bipartisan support, although many Democrats later abandoned the effort, saying it provided too big a handout to the pharmaceutical industry without requiring enough competition.
A check of the rolls confirmed that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress at the time of the vote in 2003 and that the bill passed with strong GOP support.
According to voting records, the GOP held a 229 to 205 majority in the House at the time of the Nov. 22 vote, and of the 229 Republicans, 204 voted in favor . Across the hall in the Senate, Republicans held a 51 to 48 majority on Nov.  25 when 42 of the 51 GOP Senators supported the bill. Nine Republican Senators voted against.
In the Senate, only 11 of 47 Democrats approved the bill, with 36 against and two abstaining. And, in the House, only 16 Democrats voted in favor, with 185 against.
Of the current presidential field, Paul voted against the bill, while then-U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted in favor. (We recently checked his claim that the program was coming in below projections.)
The bill had roots in previous Democratic proposals, said Jack Hoadley, a policy analyst at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. But ""the version of the drug benefit that passed was certainly the Republican approach -- competing private plans, no government regulation,"" Hoadley said. ""There wasn't a lot of compromising.""
So Paul is right about the Republicans being the driving force.
And how much did it expand government? Hugely. The new drug benefit was used by 34.5 million beneficiaries in 2010, and that number is projected to reach 40.5 million in 2015. (Most were already enrolled in Medicare.)
Through 2010, Medicare Part D had cost $203 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office . The program is expected to cost another $391 billion through 2015, according to CBO projections. ""It was certainly not the first time that Congress tried to improve the system of private plans within Medicare. But it’s fair to say with the addition of the drug benefit, it was the biggest expansion of the program since the beginning,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group.
""(It) was filling a major gap that existed since the beginning of the program,"" he said. ""That was a real, fundamental change.""",1,Ron Paul
"Says Donald Trump has ""changed his mind"" on abortion. Of all the leading Republican candidates, Donald Trump’s credentials on the issue of abortion are the most spotty.
Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made sure to highlight this during the first Republican presidential debate. When asked about Trump’s top position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump has connected with a legitimate frustration.
""Whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would (be) resolved, the political class has failed you,"" Fiorina said. ""That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?""
In this fact-check, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion.
Fiorina’s staff apparently was so sure this would come up, a day after the debate, they posted a page on their campaign website with supporting information. They cited articles from the Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trump’s shift from saying he was pro-choice to now saying he is pro-life.
'I am very pro-choice'
Trump’s flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC’s  Meet the Press , when he was thinking about a third-party run.
""I am very pro-choice,"" Trump said. ""I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I hear people debating the subject.""
When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called ""partial-birth"" by abortion foes, Trump said, ""No. I would not. I am pro-choice in every respect as far as it goes, but I just hate it.""
In his 2000 book  The America We Deserve , Trump affirmed his basic position, but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure.
""There are some issues I don’t want to say much about. I support a woman’s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures. When Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial-birth abortion if I were president, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban.""
So, as of 2000, Trump has ""pro-choice instincts.""
'I'm pro-life'
In mid February 2011, with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president, he spoke at the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Committee . In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple declaration: ""I am pro-life.""
A few months later in April, he sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network ’s political correspondent, who asked if he would really stand by his new belief. Here is what Trump said:
""One thing about me, I’m a very honorable guy. I’m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago.
One of the reasons I changed — one of the primary reasons — a friend of mine, his wife was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and ... he didn’t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He’s crying as he’s telling me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, through luck because they didn’t have the right timing, he ends up having the baby, and the baby is the apple of his eye. He said, it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him.
And you know, here’s a baby that wasn’t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.""
So, by 2011, Trump opposed abortion.
These days, he often re-tells the story about his friend’s unplanned child.
A curious interruption
Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News . Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape.
But we noted this twist in that brief discussion:
Trump: ""With caveats, life of the mother, incest and rape. And that’s where I stand. So I’m pro-life, but with the caveats. It’s life of the mother,very important, incest and rape.""
Halperin: ""So say a woman is pregnant and it’s not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion, should she --""
Trump: ""It depends when, it depends when. It depends when.""
Halperin: ""Well let’s say early in her pregnancy.""
Trump: ""Excuse me. If it’s not in any of those -- pro-life.  Mark it’s very simple. Pro-life.""
Trump interrupted Halperin to say ""it depends when."" We reached out to Trump’s campaign and asked what he meant. We did not hear back.",1,Carly Fiorina
"""In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools."" Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal appeared on  Fox News Sunday  July 12, 2015, to talk policy, taxes and Louisiana's success. He especially lauded the state’s advances in education.
""In Louisiana, we privatized our state charity hospital system. We've got statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child instead of the child following the dollars. In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools. Doubling the number doing reading and math on grade level in five years.""
Not a lot of school districts across the nation can claim charter school attendance rates that are quite so high. Using data from the 2012-13 school year, 92 percent of school districts had less than half of their total students attending a charter school.
Is New Orleans that different?
According to data, the answer is yes. In 2012-2013, the New Orleans School District had 84.1% of all its students attending charter schools. In 2013-14 that number increased to 91 percent .
New Orleans’ charter school rate is uncharacteristically high even compared to other Louisiana districts, as the following chart shows.
Why do students overwhelmingly attend charter schools in New Orleans?
The answer may have something to do with the sheer number of charter schools there. Of the 82 schools currently in the Orleans Parish, 76 are charter schools . Only 6 are non-charter public schools.
Why so many?
The history of charter schools in New Orleans tracks back to 1995. That year, Louisiana passed its first charter school law, which allowed up to eight volunteer districts to have charter schools established. In 1997, the law was changed so that any districts could volunteer, although ""the number of charter schools statewide was capped at 42.""
In 1998, the first charter school opened in New Orleans. However, it would be almost a decade before charter schools became prevalent in there.
The Louisiana Legislature established the Recovery School District in 2003. The RSD ""is a special school district run by the Louisiana Department of Education that intervenes in the management of chronically low-performing schools.""
That year, ""chronically low-performing schools"" were defined as those that earned the ""lowest performance label, Academically Unacceptable (AUS), for four consecutive years.""
That first year, 17 schools were identified for takeover. Sixteen of those schools were in New Orleans.
After the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education gave the RSD the green light to take control of the schools, the RSD had the choice of either ""directly operat(ing) the schools itself, or to contract with universities or non-profit organizations to operate them as charter schools.""
Laura Hawkins, the deputy chief of staff at RSD, said the RSD always had the goal of establishing charter schools, believing from the start that it was ""the best strategy.""
Still, before 2005, there were only a handful of charter schools in New Orleans. ""Charter schools were a nascent movement,"" said Hawkins.
And then Hurricane Katrina came.
Brian Beabout, a professor of educational leadership at the University of New Orleans, has studied education reform in post-Katrina New Orleans. ""In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, (New Orleans) temporarily lost 100 percent of its students and did not reopen a single school for more than two months,"" Beabout wrote in a 2007 article .
When the Orleans Parish School Board did reopen public schools in January 2006, those schools were reopened as charters. Why? ""OPSB opted to open the schools as charter schools to take advantage of the U.S. schools,"" said a Cowen Institute report .
""(The OPSB) had easy access to government money,"" said Hawkins.
Part of the Katrina legacy
After the hurricane, many in New Orleans realized they had the opportunity to start with a "" clean educational slate "" and restructure the school system. In response, the state Legislature introduced Act 35.
""(This) amendment changed the focus from chronically failing individual schools and added a ‘district in academic crisis,’ "" Beabout said.
""(The amendment) was tailored specifically to wrest control of New Orleans public schools from the locally elected school board and put them in the hands of the RSD. They defined any district with a certain percent of failing schools as ""in crisis"" and took control of all schools in the district which performed below the state average.
Initially, 114 schools were transferred over the RSD for control. The Cowen Institute reports that under Act 35, the RSD ""was empowered to lease, rebuild, or renovate the school facilities as necessary for the successful operation of schools, but it could not sell any school buildings, as they still belonged to the OPSB.""
Because of the sudden increase of schools given to it for control, the RSD did not have enough approved charter organizations established. Because of this, the RSD took direct control of some schools as a school district. Over the years, as more charters were established, the number of schools run directly by the RSD decreased. In 2014, the RSD became a 100 percent charter school district .
For the record, all of this largely played out before Jindal was elected governor in 2007.",1,Bobby Jindal
"""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts."" With heavily armored vehicles stationed in the streets and law enforcement officers dressed in camouflage, many have dubbed Ferguson, Mo., a "" war zone .""
After a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown Aug. 9, much of the conversation has focused on race relations, and the interactions between police and the community. There’s also been criticism of local police forces using military-style equipment and generally giving the appearance of conducting a military operation.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., weighed in on this topic in a Time magazine column , where he said big government’s to blame for this trend.
""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.""
Many recent media reports have tied police militarization to a federal program that gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., has announced that he’s working on a bill to amend this program, in order to scale back police militarization, in light of the situation in Ferguson.
We wanted to know more about the program and what experts had to say about it.
They told us that the program certainly has contributed to a militarized police force, but that's not the only reason.
What is this program, and is it to blame?
Paul’s talking about the 1033 program, known as such because it’s outlined in section 1033 of the 1997 National Defense Authorization Act.
Congress first approved the program in the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act (then section 1208), as part of the country’s war on drugs, which began in the 1970s. Law enforcement agencies felt outgunned -- police carried handguns, while drug criminals wielded assault rifles. However, much of the equipment the agencies wanted was far out of their price range.
The 1033 program allows local law enforcement agencies to acquire surplus military equipment, at nearly no cost (they have to pay for transporting the equipment). This ranges from field gear -- like assault weapons, armored vehicles, night-vision goggles and bulletproof vests -- to office supplies -- like filing cabinets, computers and desks.
More than 8,000 agencies participate in the 1033 program, which has given out more than $5 billion in property since it started, according to the website of the Defense Logistics Agency , the government body that oversees the program. (To be clear, the incentive here is the free equipment alone, not any additional payment or reward for accepting it.)
Law enforcement agencies apply for specific equipment through the Defense Logistics Agency . Agencies are given preference if they request equipment specifically for counter-drug and counter-terrorism purposes.
Additionally, since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have received grants from the Department of Homeland Security to address potential terrorist threats, and some have used those grants to purchase military gear.
Public opinion on police using military equipment varies with context, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation and a former police chief. For example, in the case of a major bank robbery where multiple robbers have machine guns and are holding people hostage, the community would likely be glad their local police has comparable weapons, an armored vehicle and protective gear.
However, when police break out that sort of equipment and military-style tactics at a peaceful protest, they look understandably bad, Bueermann said.
For example, HBO television host John Oliver ridiculed police in Keene, N.H., recently for requesting a ""military-grade armored personnel truck,"" citing the town’s annual pumpkin festival as a potential terrorist target. (We rated Oliver’s statement True .)
What else is at play?
We spoke with many experts, and all agreed that there is an upward trend of police militarization. They said the 1033 program has accelerated this trend, but it’s not the sole cause. Much of the change is rooted in police culture.
In fact, many of the experts we spoke with said that absent the 1033 program, police would still want military-grade equipment -- they just wouldn’t be able to afford it.
""Militarization is not just equipment -- it’s an ideology and a mindset,"" said Victor Kappeler, associate dean of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University.
The shift from a community service culture to one that is more militaristic began in the 1960s with the rise of SWAT teams -- made prominent by the Los Angeles Police Department and their response to the violent Watts Riots, said Brian Buchner, president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. Police departments across the country quickly created their own SWAT teams elite squads that used military-like tactics.
Police started to use SWAT-like tactics in less hostile situations -- such as no-knock raids to execute low-level drug busts -- because of a small (and in some cases unreasonable)  fear that they would encounter heavily armed suspects, Buchner said.
""That training seeped into other parts of police operations and police culture,"" Buchner said.
The 1033 program has exacerbated the problem, because in the past, when police agencies didn’t have this equipment, they were unable to act as a military force, Kappeler said. Instead of responding to a protest with armored vehicles, they would have had to address the issue in a ""community-based"" way.
But it’s not just the government pushing this equipment on law enforcement agencies. Private defense manufacturers have also started to make dual-purpose equipment that they can market to the military, as well as civilian law enforcement agencies, said Kathleen Campbell, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who studies role convergence between police and the military. (Campbell asked us to note that her views and research are her own and do not reflect the views of West Point, the army or the federal government.)
Now when police officers see military-style equipment and uniforms in catalogs, they think that’s what they’re supposed to look like -- perpetuating the culture, said John DeCarlo, an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police chief, in a  Washington Post  interview.
Culture spillover also comes from interactions between the police and military, Campbell said, noting that the two collaborate in anti-drug and anti-terror efforts.
Aspects of police work that mirror the military -- like officer hierarchy and a focus on discipline -- make the profession a good fit for former military personnel. A 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics study found that 10 percent of all employed male veterans ages 18 to 54 work in some sort of protective service, which includes police, sheriff officers, correctional officers, bailiffs and security workers.
The recent recession also could have forced police to lose sight of community policing, Bueermann said. Stripped down to their bare bones, some agencies have lost community policing positions, like school resource officers, and are left only with the law enforcement positions. This makes them appear less like they are there to help the community and more like they are there to control it. And it has made agencies more inclined to take advantage of programs like 1033 because they can get free equipment.",1,Rand Paul
"""The Capitol was built by slaves."" Every now and then, a fact goes viral. Current case in point: that slaves helped construct the U.S. Capitol, where the son of an African man is set to be sworn in as the nation's 44th president.
Pundits and politicians have mentioned this dozens of times in the past few days, wielding it as potent shorthand for all the historical import of the moment.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, mentioned it in her remarks at the Dec. 2, 2008, dedication of the Capitol Visitors Center:
""The Capitol was built by slaves,"" Pelosi said. ""Today, I want to talk about the fact that it's so appropriate that, though long overdue, this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009, which is the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator.""
We wanted to find the details behind the assertion and give it more context.
It turns out there's far less in the historical record on the subject than one might expect. Early historians of the Capitol's construction were largely indifferent to the work of common laborers, both paid and slave. Records from the time are spotty.
Only in the past 15 years or so has attention been trained on the role slaves played in constructing perhaps the nation's most important building — and the work has been led not by professional historians, but by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck.
In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject, which issued a report in conjunction with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, finally bringing a measure of scholarly rigor to bear on the topic.
The task force acknowledged it was not able to tell the full story. ""No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building — or the White House,"" says the 2005 task force report, entitled  History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol.
But the task force did find plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction. Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the Capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the Capitol. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for ""Negro hire,"" a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves.
Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.
Slave crews also toiled at the marble and sandstone quarries that provided the stone to face the structure — lonely, grueling work with bleak living conditions in rural Virginia and elsewhere. ""Keep the yearly hirelings at work from sunrise to sunset — particularly the Negroes,"" the commissioners wrote to quarry operator William O'Neale in 1794.
The commissioners' use of slave labor was unremarkable for the time. When the Capitol was constructed, from 1793 to 1826, the building trades in almost every colony augmented the work force with slave labor. This would have been especially true in the Potomac region — the home of about half the 750,000 African-Americans living in the United States, according to the 1972 book  Free Negroes in the District of Columbia,  by Letitia Woods Brown.
Most of the slaves who worked on the Capitol are known by first name at best — the records refer to a payment of $13.00 to slaveholder Teresa Bent for ""Nace,"" for example, and $23.00 to Elizabeth Brent for ""Harry"" and ""Gabe.""
But one particular slave, Philip Reid, achieved some renown as an individual. He was a slave laborer for Clark Mills, who was hired to cast the Statue of Freedom, the Capitol's crowning feature. The government paid Reid $1.25 a day for his work.
The statue, a draped female figure holding a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other, stands atop the Capitol dome, 288 feet above the site of Obama's swearing in.
Pelosi might have specified that slaves were only part of the work force, but they were involved with almost every aspect of construction for at least the first several years.",1,Nancy Pelosi
"Ken Buck wants to ""outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest."" The race for U.S. Senate in Colorado is neck-and-neck between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and Republican Ken Buck. Bennet, a former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, was appointed to the seat when then-Sen. Ken Salazar became the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration. Buck, the district attorney for Weld County, has support from the tea party movement and defeated a more establishment rival in the Republican primary.
A recent ad from Bennet attacks Buck's views as out of the mainstream.
""Extreme beauty, extreme sports -- good extremes in Colorado,"" the ad says. ""But what about Ken Buck's extreme ideas? Do we really want to privatize Social Security and risk it in the stock market? ... Are we ready to outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest? Extreme beauty is a good thing, but Colorado's no place for Buck's extreme ideas.""
We fact-checked the charge that Buck wants to privatize Social Security , and we rated that statement Half True. We found that Buck has been clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring.
This time we wanted to look at Buck's views on abortion. During a debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 17, moderator David Gregory asked Buck about waffling on issues like abortion, which made us wonder if Bennet's charge that Buck wants to ""outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest"" was true. We want to be clear here that we're not checking whether Buck's views on abortion are ""extreme"" but only whether the Bennet ad accurately characterizes them.
Our first stop was Buck's website. ""As a father of two, Ken believes in the value of life and is opposed to abortion except to protect the life of the mother,"" the site says. ""As U.S. Senator, Ken will oppose federal funding of abortion and will fight to protect the life of the unborn.""
We then turned to news coverage of Buck's public statements. Buck has said in response to questions from voters that he opposes abortion and that includes pregnancies that result from rape or incest.
""I don't believe in the exceptions of rape or incest. I believe that the only exception, I guess, is life of the mother,"" Buck said. ""And that is only if it's truly life of the mother. To me, you can't say you're pro-life and say -- if there is, and it's a very rare situation where one life would have to cease for the other life to exist. But in that very rare situation ... we may have to take the life of the child to save the life of the mother. In that rare situation, I am in favor of that exception. But, other than that, I have no exceptions in my position.""
In the course of our research, we noted two instances in which Buck has changed position on abortion-related issues, but neither one was about exceptions for rape or incest. Earlier in the campaign, Buck indicated he favored a state constitutional amendment that would have granted personhood to people ""from the beginning of biological development."" Later, he backed off full support for the amendment, because some people believe the amendment will outlaw some forms of birth control.
""I have said that I am in favor of personhood as a concept,"" Buck said in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS's Face the Nation. ""I am not taking a position on any of the state amendments, and I have said over and over again -- and it has been reported over and over again -- that I am not in favor of banning any common forms of birth control in Colorado or in the United States.""
His website also says, ""Ken believes life begins at conception and does not favor doing away with common forms of birth control, like the pill.""
The other question has been whether Buck would vote to confirm presidential nominees who favor abortion rights. Buck indicated earlier in the campaign that he would not confirm such nominees, but later he said he would only oppose nominees who are activists for abortion rights.
""I won't use abortion as a litmus test with a pro-choice individual,"" Buck told Schieffer. ""Someone that is an activist on the abortion issue, I think, goes outside the pale, and I cannot support an activist on the abortion issue.""
To be clear, we did not find any instance of Buck changing position from the view that abortion law should not include exceptions for rape or incest. And a campaign spokesperson reaffirmed that position.
""Ken is pro-life, and only has one exception -- that's when the life of the mother is at risk,"" said Owen Loftus.
But Loftus also said that Buck is focused on economic issues and government spending. ""The reality is that the Senate only deals with a few abortion related issues -- partial birth abortion and public funding. Ken would not support either. This ad is another example of how Michael Bennet wants to talk about anything but the issues that Coloradans care about -- creating jobs, controlling spending and getting our economy back on track.""
In reviewing the record, Buck has said he opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape or incest. We did not find any evidence of him changing position on that issue over the course of the campaign.",1,Michael Bennet
"Says Donald Trump ""was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them."" With two weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton used a rally in Florida to undermine Donald Trump’s reputation as a prospective commander-in-chief.
Clinton said Trump in a tweet called efforts against terrorists in Mosul ""a total disaster"" and said the United States was ""looking dumb.""
""He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military,"" Clinton said Oct. 25 in Coconut Creek, Fla. ""Here's another example: He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.""
Has Trump said he would first check who’s making payments before defending them?
In media interviews, he has said there’s no obligation to defend them if they don’t pay up. Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
NATO and unfulfilled ‘obligations’
Clinton is talking about Trump’s comments about NATO during the campaign.
NATO, founded after World War II by the United States and 11 other members, now has 28 members, all agreeing to use political and military means to safeguard members’ freedom and security.
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty -- NATO’s founding treaty -- says parties agree that an attack against one shall be considered an attack against all, and agree to assist members who are attacked. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.
To back Clinton’s claim, her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy. Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
""Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have 'fulfilled their obligations to us,' "" the New York Times reported.
According to a transcript of the interview with the New York Times, Trump also said many NATO members ""aren’t paying their bills.""
Reporter David E. Sanger: ""That’s true, but we are treaty-obligated under NATO, forget the bills part.""
Trump: ""You can’t forget the bills. They have an obligation to make payments. Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they’re supposed to make. That’s a big thing. You can’t say forget that.""
Sanger: ""My point here is, can the members of NATO, including the new members in the Baltics, count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations —""
Trump: ""Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.""
Reporter Maggie Haberman: ""And if not?""
Trump: ""Well, I’m not saying if not. I’m saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us.""
So in that interview, Trump argued other NATO countries had to ""fulfill their obligations"" to receive the United States’ military aid. Asked to clarify what would happen to countries who hadn’t paid, he demurred.
In May 2016, Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that when other NATO nations ""don’t pay up, they’ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.""
Trump said he did not want to get out of NATO, but wanted ""the countries of NATO to pay us.""
There’s a problem with the way Trump has talked about NATO country payments.
""No one in NATO actually ‘pays us’ to defend them, as Trump repeatedly claims, nor is there any obligation to do so,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.
""Our commitment to come to our allies' defense -- and theirs to ours -- isn't in return for any payment,"" Daalder said. ""It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty.""
NATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares, said Jeff Rathke, senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. And to be clear, funds are paid to NATO, not to the United States.
Beyond the common funding of certain capabilities, each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense, said Rathke, who served on NATO’s International Staff from 2009 to 2011. Allies are to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, though many are not meeting the guideline.
Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack, ""it would be the end of NATO.""
""This would be a very damaging blow to U.S. national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world,"" Benitez said.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Time magazine called him ""one of America's best governors."" Mike Huckabee's new TV ad in Michigan portrays him as an energetic governor with lots of accomplishments in health care, education and tax-cutting. We've examined the education and tax-cutting claims before, so here we'll examine whether the ad is right when it says Time magazine called him ""one of America's best governors.""
Indeed, in November 2005, Time featured him in a story headlined ""America's 5 Best Governors."" (The others were Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Janet Napolitano of Arizona, Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and Mark Warner of Virginia.)
The article said Huckabee ""approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation"" and cited his accomplishments with children's health care and economic growth. It called him ""a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats.""
Time isn't the only publication to honor him that month. Governing magazine (which is owned by the same parent company as PolitiFact) named him one of its ""Public Officials of the Year.""",1,Mike Huckabee
"Says Mitt Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account."" President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign is using hard-edged irony to attack Mitt Romney in a new ad that pairs Romney singing ""America the Beautiful"" with a series of claims about Bain Capital and his use of offshore accounts in his personal finances.
In this item, we’ll look at the claim that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account.""
Romney has released tax returns for 2010 and an estimated tax return for 2011 , in addition to a number of financial disclosure forms . Each of these forms is lengthy and, unless you're an accountant, difficult to decipher.
However, the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account"" is not in doubt, since the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged it in an on-the-record call with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012.
Malt said on the call, ""Yeah, it occurs to me that one other question that came up. …  Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romney's tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003, when I became trustee of the blind trusts. It is a bank account. Nothing more, nothing less. An ordinary bank account. It earns some income, which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the (2010) tax return. You'll see approximately $1,700 of interest earned by this account, which is reported. The tax is fully paid just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that.""
Malt added, ""By the way, I did close this account in early 2010. It no longer exists.""
Reporters on the call offered two follow-up questions about the Swiss bank account. One asked, ""Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010?""
Malt responded, ""I previously said that I regularly review Gov. Romney's investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews, I decided that this account wasn't serving any particular purpose. It might or might not be consistent with Gov. Romney's political views. You know, again, taxes were all fully paid, etc., but it just wasn't worth it, and I closed the account.""
The second question asked the Romney camp to ""elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account, how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations.""
Malt responded that ""the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust. It held approximately $3 million. It was just an investment of the trust -- the bank account of the trust -- which, as I mentioned, I have subsequently closed. The bank was, sorry, Union Bank Switzerland -- UBS.""
Malt’s comments confirm that Romney ""had millions in a Swiss bank account"" because the couple filed their returns jointly, and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romney’s trusts and family trusts, not just Romney’s funds.
Meanwhile, the Romney campaign also retroactively disclosed that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form, apparently the same one that was closed in 2010. In the 2006 disclosure form, the UBS money market account was listed as being worth between $1 million and $5 million.
We should note that there’s no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account -- assets, we’ll reiterate, that were placed in the account by Malt, not by Romney. The purpose of a blind trust is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest.
The Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the U.S. Treasury. Income from the account was included in the Romney’s tax returns and all U.S. taxes due were paid during the period, the campaign said.",1,Barack Obama
"""I'm proud to have had a 100 percent pro-life voting record."" At first, one might wonder: How can former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson claim ""a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" when the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest and most prominent antiabortion advocacy group, graded him at only 33 percent during his last term in Congress? And 77 percent the term before that? And 87 percent in the term before that?
The answer is in the details.
As a senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002, Thompson's voting record indeed shows he compiled a perfect record on voting against abortion rights, cloning and certain research that many antiabortion advocates find objectionable.
He voted against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion. Several times, he voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the woman -- not her health - is at stake. He supported a ban on abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion.
So what's with the middling marks from the National Right to Life Committee's grade, then? The Washington-based group, which boasts 3,000 chapters in all 50 states, ranks members of Congress each year on their votes.
But Thompson was docked not for his votes on so-called ""life issues;"" instead, he lost points for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that sought to limit the contributions or advertising of outside interest groups. Many advocacy organizations opposed these reforms because they feared they'd lose influence in Congress.
In 1995, he also supported a welfare reform bill the group opposed, said David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life.
But on matters dearest to their members' hearts, Thompson is right on, O'Steen said. He also voted with the group against cloning and fetal tissue research, and for limits on how federal funding could be used for family planning activities abroad, his voting record shows.
In fact, the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed him for president.
""It's very fair for him to say that on every bill that came forward, he cast a pro-life vote,"" O'Steen said. ""I think he's fairly characterizing this. He's got a very pro-life record, and that was a big part of our endorsement –- it's not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid.""
The ad, which aired first in Iowa, then nationally on Fox News, is designed to help Thompson set himself apart from his chief Republican rivals, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in the race for the GOP nomination. Romney says he now opposes abortion; when he ran for governor, he said he was in favor of abortion rights. Giuliani publicly supports abortion rights.
By contrast, Thompson's commitment in public life to the policies espoused by antiabortion groups has never wavered.",1,Fred Thompson
"""If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work, or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."" The last time we rated a Mitt Romney claim on unemployment, we dinged him with a Half True for using a big number without describing it accurately. This time, he got it right. In a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012 , Romney said, ""If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.""
That's much more accurate than his statement at the Tampa debate on Jan. 23, when he said that ""we have 25 million Americans out of work."" We rated that Half True , concluding that Romney had used a valid number but had described it incorrectly.
Here’s the background.
Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a cross-section of Americans to determine, among other things, their employment status. The respondents are characterized as either being in the labor force or out of it.
Those who are out of the labor force are not considered as seeking work at present. Some have no intention of working anytime soon -- they may be full-time students, stay-at-home parents, retired or physically unable to work. But others in this category are considered "" marginally attached "" to the labor force. They want work, are available to work and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months -- but by the BLS definition, they do not qualify as being in the labor force because they have not actively searched for work in the previous four weeks.
Now let’s look at those considered to be in the labor force. They are categorized as either employed or unemployed. The ""employed"" group also has a sub-category -- part-timers who would rather be working full-time but who aren’t due to economic conditions.
For the best-known unemployment rate figure, the BLS divides the total number of the unemployed (that is, those without jobs who are actively looking for work) by the number of people in the labor force (that is, unemployed workers plus employed workers, both full- and part-time).
However, some critics have argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting. So BLS also offers a broader, alternative measure of ""labor underutilization"" known as ""U-6."" It calculates this by dividing the sum of three groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached workers.
To make this methodology more concrete, let’s compare how those numbers looked in January 2012, the most recent month available.
The regular unemployment rate was 8.3 percent. However, the U-6 rate was significantly higher -- 15.1 percent. The difference stems from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they’d rather be full-time or have given up looking work, at least for now. (Here's a comparison of various BLS measures.)
So Romney is right when he says that ""if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."" This is an improvement from his phrasing in the Tampa debate, when he didn’t preface his statistic by noting that he’s referring to the broader, U-6 methodology.
A final bit of context: While it’s certainly bad news to have 15.1 percent of the workforce either unemployed or under-employed, it’s worth noting that this statistic, like the more commonly used unemployment rate, is heading in a favorable direction. After rising as high as 17.2 percent in October 2009, the U-6 is now as low as it’s been since February 2009, the second month of Barack Obama’s presidency.
That said, this level is still historically high. Since the statistic was first published in 1994, it has only broken into double digits for stretches following two previous recessions -- the recessions that hit in 1990-91 and 2001. And the U-6 peaks for those recessions were 11.8 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively -- well below even today’s improved level.",1,Mitt Romney
"Says Donald Trump's foundation ""took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."" President Barack Obama went to Philadelphia on Sept. 13 to campaign for Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from pneumonia. In his speech, Obama didn’t hold back in his critique of Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump.
In one particularly vivid line, Obama took a shot at Trump’s foundation, contrasting it with the Clintons’ foundation, which focuses on improving global health.
The Clinton Foundation has been attacked by critics for taking money from donors who might have business before a future President Clinton.
But Obama was having none of it.
""You want to debate foundations and charities?"" Obama said. ""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself.""
Obama added, to laughter, ""I mean, you know, he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but…""
We have previously written about how the Clinton Foundation helped 9 million people receive lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine, as well as the foundation’s controversies .
But what about Obama’s statement that Trump’s foundation ""took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself""?
The White House confirmed that the statement stems from a widely read Washington Post story by reporter David Fahrenthold, who’s written a series of stories about Trump Foundation and has inquired with organizations around the country to see if they actually received money from the real estate mogul.
Fahrenthold provided new details of his investigations in a Sept. 10, 2016, Post  article headlined, ""How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people’s money.""
Based on a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with more than 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, Fahrenthold found that ""nearly all"" of its money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation’s coffers dating from 2008.
Experts told Fahrenthold that such an arrangement ""is almost unheard of for a family foundation.""
The story by Fahrenthold includes the anecdote referenced by Obama in Philadelphia, which Fahrenthold wrote was one of two cases he found in which Trump used his money from the charity to ""buy himself a gift."" By doing so, he wrote, the foundation appeared to be flouting IRS rules by buying items that only seemed to be for Trump’s benefit.
""In 2007, for instance, Trump and his wife, Melania, attended a benefit for a children’s charity held at Mar-a-Lago. The night’s entertainment was Michael Israel, who bills himself as ‘the original speed painter.’ His frenetic act involved painting giant portraits in five to seven minutes — then auctioning off the art he’d just created.
""He painted Trump.
""Melania Trump bid $10,000.
""Nobody tried to outbid her.
"" ‘The auctioneer was just pretty bold, so he said, ""You know what just happened: When you started bidding, nobody’s going to bid against you, and I think it’s only fair that you double the bid,"" ' Israel said in an interview last week.
""Melania Trump increased her bid to $20,000.
"" ‘I understand it went to one of his golf courses,’ Israel said of the painting.
""The Trump Foundation paid the $20,000, according to the charity that held the benefit.""
Fahrenthold’s article notes that the Post submitted detailed questions to the campaign but officials declined to comment. The campaign did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact for this article.
We asked Fahrenthold whether Obama’s version jibed with his reporting.
""It seems pretty accurate to me,"" Fahrenthold told PolitiFact. ""I talked to both the charity that held the auction and the artist who made the painting. They told me Melania Trump had actually been the one bidding on the painting at the auction, which she won for $20,000 -- half went to charity, half went to the artist. But the actual check came from the Trump Foundation, of which Donald is president and Melania is not an officer of any kind.""
He added that the auction seems to have been held in 2006 but the check wasn’t cut until 2007, a year in which ""almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people’s money.""
Specifically, according to Fahrenthold’s reporting, the Trump Foundation began that year with $4,238 in the bank. Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year. But other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire.
Using the most generous calculation, Fahrenthold said, Trump’s own money accounted for less than 1 percent of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238.
""So it was almost all other people’s money,"" he said.
So where is the painting? That’s a bit more mysterious. Even crowdsourcing the search through Twitter hasn’t produced a verified image of the painting.
""I can’t find the damn thing,"" Fahrenthold said. ""It’s out there somewhere. Neither the painter nor the charity -- the Children's Place at Home Safe, in Boca Raton, Fla. -- have been able to provide a picture of it.""",1,Barack Obama
"""Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as ‘experiment’"" Public outcry over President Donald Trump’s now-terminated family separation policy inspired several defenses of the practice, with many conservative politicians and pundits arguing that it was a continuation of policies from earlier administrations.

Citing a Feb. 11, 2015, report from the Washington Post, the Lid story compared Trump’s policy to Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process, a pilot program in south Texas that sought to cut down on smuggling by detaining and questioning unaccompanied minors — known as ""circuit children"" — suspected of helping Mexican drug cartels transport people and narcotics across the border.
The story said Obama’s program resulted in border agents ""tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.""
""Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in ‘facilities’ so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels,"" the story said. ""A program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered un-American when the president is a Republican.""
We decided to check this claim out and see how Trump’s policy compared with the Obama program; we found significant differences between the policies and their outcomes. The Lid did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger.
Trump’s policy
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an April memorandum announcing a ""zero-tolerance"" policy , according to which all immigrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S. border were referred for federal prosecution.
Many immigrants subject to the zero-tolerance policy were adults traveling with children. Due to a 2015 district court decision , children cannot be held in federal jails with adults facing prosecution. Previous administrations shied away from prosecuting adults with children and, after the 2015 decision, tended to release families rather than separate them.
But the Trump administration, citing its zero-tolerance policy, was separating families and placing children in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services until they could be released to a sponsor. More than 2,300 children were separated from adults between May 5 and June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
There was no law requiring the separation of families, and Trump was not ""preventing kids from going to jail"" by ordering it, as the Lid story suggested.
The Juvenile Referral Process
Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process operated from May 2014 to September 2015 as a pilot program meant to combat smuggling. The program was the brainchild of former Border Patrol agent Robert Harris, whose intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of guides smuggling migrants and drugs into the U.S. were Mexicans younger than 18.
Mexican drug cartels often hire or conscript teenagers to smuggle people and drugs across the border because teenagers are not prosecuted if caught. Under laws governing treatment of ""unaccompanied alien children,"" minors from Mexico and Canada can be immediately sent back to their country. Sometimes they are deported by bus the same day they are apprehended. Minors from other nations, by contrast, must be transferred within 72 hours to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and placed in the least restrictive setting possible until they can be flown home.
Mexican teenagers smuggling on behalf of drug cartels are known as ""circuit children,"" and Harris told the Washington Post that several were caught and released multiple times before the Juvenile Referral Process, which was designed to deter repeat crossings.
In short, Mexican children suspected of smuggling drugs were held by the U.S. government rather than immediately being sent home.
""It was used for unaccompanied Mexican minors who had multiple apprehensions – up to 30 a year in a few cases – and thus were thought to be working on behalf of human and drug smuggling organizations,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.
The pilot progam also was established to create ""some type of consequence for children involved in smuggling, as they are usually just returned to Mexico and often cross again,"" said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America.
Under the program, Border Patrol worked with the federal prosecutors to determine whether to criminally prosecute a repeat border-crosser suspected of smuggling. Those not selected for prosecution were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement like minors from non-contiguous countries instead of being deported.
While detained — sometimes for months — and awaiting the chance to appear before an immigration court, minors under the Juvenile Referral Process faced questioning from U.S. authorities about their affiliations. Most minors who completed the program were eventually deported after seeing an immigration judge, according to a 2015 report from the Washington Office on Latin America.
Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said conditions under the Juvenile Referral Process were not great. ""It was a small pilot program for sure, although the detention facilities were certainly problematic and the length of detention uncertain,"" she said.
Gilman noted that other facilities in Karnes City and Dilley, Texas, which the Obama administration used as licensed childcare facilities to detain families seeking asylum, did ""resemble internment camps."" She said this practice was ""carefully circumscribed"" by the end of the Obama administration as a result of legal challenges.
But those facilities were separate from the process created under the Juvenile Referral Process, which handled only unaccompanied ""circuit children"" and placed them in the same Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities used for unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries.
According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement website , these facilities are state-licensed and provide a range of care — including foster care, group homes, shelter, staff secure, secure and residential treatment centers — and they offer classroom education, health care, socialization and recreation opportunities, mental health services, legal services and case management.
Meyer said these children were usually placed in the ""‘secure’ juvenile detention centers that are more restrictive"" because of their criminal activities. ""I never heard of any Mexican child in a ‘detention camp,’"" she said.
Still, human rights advocates objected to the Juvenile Referral Program as an intelligence-gathering enterprise that could jeopardize minors’ post-deportation security. Violent drug cartels often retaliate against members suspected of talking with law enforcement by taking action against them or their families.",0,Bloggers
"About 106,000 soldiers had ""a prescription of three weeks or more"" for pain, depression or anxiety medication. Leaders of the U.S. Army need to take more active steps to prevent a growing number of soldiers from committing suicide, according to a major study released by the Army. Gen. Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. The study documented complex pressures -- including overly long deployments, more tolerance for high-risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers.
Another complicating factor: increased use of prescription antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and pain medications.
""We know that we had over 106,000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine,"" said Chiarelli.
A few moments later, he added, ""A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue. There are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet, and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment, and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt.""
Chiarelli was referring to information in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report , released Aug. 5, 2010. This seemed like an important issue to explore further.
The report explains that historically, the Army's suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian population's. But the Army's rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. That year, the suicide rate in the Army was 20.2 per 100,000, compared with a typical civilian rate of 19.2. This increase prompted the study.
""In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population,"" the study states. ""If we include accidental death, which frequently is the result of high risk behavior (drinking and driving, drug overdose, etc.), we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions. Simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy.""
The report affirms the 106,000 number that Chiarelli uses. ""Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106,000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain, depression or anxiety medications. The potential for abuse is obvious,"" it states.
The report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military:
""There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system. This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals. For example, the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use. Unfortunately, there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit. As a result, we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors.""
The report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29, and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants -- specifically, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -- among young people, and whether these medications sometimes increas e the risk of suicide. ""The Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care,"" the report states.
The report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military. Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs; ""14% of the force is taking some form of opiate medication,"" according to the report.  The percentage for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications appear somewhat lower, with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication, according to evidence the report cites. Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression.
We should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides. ""The impact of increased use of antidepressant, psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population,"" the report states.
In the interview with Amanpour, Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated. ""We know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others,"" he said.
Finally, we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled ""The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison."" The Army has been transformed in recent years, the report states, so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than ""good order and discipline practices."" Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections ""have been lost"" as part of that transition. ""There are instances where a leader’s lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks,"" the report noted.
While the report raises a host of issues, we're only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers. The Army report and other testimony that we found support Chiarelli's statement that approximately 106,000 soldiers had ""a prescription of three weeks or more"" for pain, depression or anxiety medication.",1,Gen.

"""There is already a mosque four blocks away."" In the debate over the inaccurately named ""Ground Zero Mosque,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been one of the strongest and most consistent political voices in favor of it.
In what the AP described as an ""impassioned speech"" at an event on Aug. 24, 2010, marking the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Bloomberg said not allowing the proposal for a mosque two blocks from Ground Zero would be ""compromising our commitment to fighting terror with freedom.""
And Bloomberg dismissed those who have called for a compromise solution, moving it to another location.
""The question will then become how big should the no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center be,"" Bloomberg said. ""There is already a mosque four blocks away. Should it, too, be moved?""
With all the hand-wringing over the proposal for an Islamic cultural center with a mosque just two blocks away from Ground Zero, we wondered whether Bloomberg was right that there is already a mosque just four blocks away from the World Trade Center site.
In short, yes.
The mosque Bloomberg is referring to is Masjid Manhattan, which is located in the basement floor of a building at 20 Warren Street. And it's four blocks from the World Trade Center.
Masjid Manhattan has been a fixture of the Lower Manhattan neighborhood since 1970. According to its website, hundreds gather there daily for five ""Congregational Salahs"" and more than 1,000 regularly attend Congregational Friday Sermons.
The home page of the mosque's website currently carries the following ""disclaimer"":
""Please be advised that we are by no means affiliated with any other organization trying to build anything new in the area of downtown Manhattan.
""Since 1970, Masjid Manhattan has been a peaceful, not-for-profit organization located in the area of downtown Manhattan. Our members are City, State and Federal employees, as well as professional employees of the Financial area who come to our Masjid to perform their daily prayers.
""Masjid Manhattan and its members condemn any type of terrorist acts. In particular, the attacks of 9/11 where non-Muslims as well as Muslims lost their lives. Islam always invites for peace; therefore Islam is not responsible for the actions of some ill individuals who, independently from what Islam advocates, have hatred against humanity. As Muslims and as Americans, we will never forget the beloved ones who perished that terrible day of September 11, 2001.""
For some perspective on the relative distances between Ground Zero, the proposed mosque and the existing Masjid Manhattan, we direct you to the Washington Post's interactive online map showing the location of all three sites .
There's also a mosque 12 blocks from Ground Zero, Masjid al-Farah, where Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has been a longtime prayer leader. Rauf is one of the principals behind the plan for the cultural center and mosque proposal at 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site.
While Masjid Manhattan is conservative and Masjid al-Farah more progressive, a New York Times profile of the two mosques notes that both are essentially one-room operations. And they share another similarity, the story notes: both ""routinely turn people away for lack of space."" In fact, due to the spillover from Masjid al-Farah, Rauf has been leading prayer services since 2009 in one of the buildings at the heart of the controversy.
Plans for the new property are much more ambitious than the settings of the existing mosques, calling for a $100 million, 15-story community center with a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial. The plans also include a mosque that the site's organizers estimated could attract as many as 2,000 worshippers on Fridays, according to the Washington Post .
Again, in making his argument against a ""no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center,"" Bloomberg said there's already a mosque four blocks away from Ground Zero. He's right.",1,Michael Bloomberg
"Says Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. At the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama had broken an important promise.
""You've been president four years,"" Romney said at the Oct. 3, 2012, debate in Denver. ""You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. …""
He added, ""I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.""
We’ve heard the claim before that Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. Let’s review our findings.
Remarks from 2009
Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a ""Fiscal Responsibility Summit"" one month after his inauguration.
His words: ""Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""
He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. That figure was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011.
In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in an August 2012 report .
The estimate marks the fourth year in a row with a deficit of more than $1 trillion, the CBO noted, although the projection is down slightly from the $1.2 trillion deficit that CBO projected in March.
""This year’s deficit will be three-quarters as large as the deficit in 2009 when measured relative to the size of the economy,"" the report noted.
So the deficit is shrinking, but it’s nowhere near half the level from 2009.
PolitiFact Florida previously asked the Obama campaign about the pledge. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012.
""Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized,"" he said. ""Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …""",1,Mitt Romney
"""A trade war is something very different (than curbing new trade agreements). We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful."" During a speech in which she attacked Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas as ""dangerously incoherent,"" Hillary Clinton reached back almost nine decades to make a Great Depression-era analogy.
Clinton said she understood voters’ concerns about the negative impacts of free trade agreements -- a big driver of Trump’s electoral success so far. Still, pursuing large tariffs against such trading partners as China and Mexico -- as Trump has suggested -- would be dangerously misguided, Clinton argued.
""I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements,"" Clinton said. ""I do, too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful.""
We wondered whether there is widespread support among historians and economists for the idea that raising tariffs and enabling a trade war ""made the Great Depression longer and more painful.""
When we asked the Clinton campaign for its evidence, they pointed us to a 2013 speech by Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke, whose expertise as an academic was the Great Depression.
But we found additional support among other experts who have studied the period.
The Smoot-Hawley tariffs
If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found.
In a career-making scene , Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.)
Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here ):
""In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.""
Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Clinton said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got even worse.
Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 -- sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. -- raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. These moves, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own.
So how accurate is the Clinton-Stein version of events? Several economists and historians who studied the period said that it’s quite accurate.
Expert opinions
Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said Clinton was ""astute"" in distinguishing between putting the brakes on future expansion of free trade, as Trump and Clinton have both at times advocated, and actually reversing established trade agreements by imposing new tariffs, as only Trump has suggested.
""Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression, but I think saying it made it longer and more painful is actually quite well put,"" Irwin said.
Irwin said there was ""no real reason"" to impose such tariffs, and that it was mainly done for ""domestic political reasons."" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly, over the spirited objections of many economists.
After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports.
""Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,"" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that ""if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time.""
Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office.
Roosevelt ""came in on the traditional Democratic platform that tariffs should fall, and his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, was practically a one-issue man on the subject of freeing up trade,"" said Eric Rauchway, a historian at the University of California-Davis and author of The Money Makers: How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression, Defeated Fascism, and Secured a Prosperous Peace. ""The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 started the U.S. down that road, giving the executive power to negotiate agreements on tariffs. Hull used this power to bring down trade barriers.""
As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan.
This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression.
""Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,"" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century.
For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade.
Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression -- he points instead to insufficiently effective New Deal policies under Roosevelt -- the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative.
It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said.
""It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,"" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. ""However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression.""
Alonzo L. Hamby, an Ohio University historian and author of For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s, agreed.
""I think Clinton has a strong case for the proposition that it hurt an economy that already had moved into a deep recession,"" Hamby said.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges."" Seattle police seizing a man’s gun under the state’s ""red flag"" law has led to numerous false reports on right-wing websites that police arbitrarily took away a man’s Second Amendment rights.
""Seattle police begin gun confiscations: no laws broken, no warrant, no charges,"" stated a March 7 headline on Liberty Headlines .
The story was attributed to Zero Hedge , which used a story from the website SHTFplan that claimed that Seattle police used ""Nazi style gun confiscation."" The same or similar stories have appeared on many right-leaning websites .
The Liberty Headlines story said that police seized the man’s gun after neighbors had complained the man had been ""staring"" at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. Other residents complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe.""
The story declared ""tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil"" and that ""a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.""
Sounds alarming. But it’s not accurate.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31-year-old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing, as ordered by the court.
‘Red Flag’ laws in Washington and other states
In 2016, Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts, upon petition by police or a family or household member, to issue an extreme risk protection order. The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger.
A handful of other states, including California, have similar ""red flag"" laws, and many other states are considering passing them. Following the Parkland shooting, Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order.
While the NRA argues the laws violate a person’s rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed, law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs.
Details about the Seattle police seizing a man’s handgun
PolitiFact interviewed Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders, as well as Seattle police spokesman Det. Patrick Michaud.
Police did not released the suspect’s name. PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie, an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder.
Police said they had received multiple calls about McKenzie’s escalating behavior in the past year.
McKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti-harassment order, even though he wasn’t required to do so. He acknowledged he was experiencing ""stress"" and did not want the gun around, Michaud said.
Months later, McKenzie, who lives above a restaurant, had several interactions with the restaurant staff. In one instance, he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor.
""No crimes were committed at that time, but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all; resulting in contact"" by police, Michaud said.
McKenzie declined services, but shortly thereafter he called police again to report ""taunting and voices"" coming from the restaurant below through the floor.
He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee ""arrested or shot"" by police, Michaud said.
McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility.
On Feb. 13, police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzie’s gun. A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility.
He agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm. After he left the medical facility on Feb. 23, police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm.
After McKenzie didn’t show up for his Feb. 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun, the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest. McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order, a gross misdemeanor.
On March 1, police went to McKenzie’s apartment and took his gun. He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail. The case remains pending.
Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017, Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns. This was the only case in which the suspect didn’t voluntarily surrender a gun.
One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a ""warrant"" added an editor’s note about errors in its original article. The SHFTplan website, which has the tagline ""when it hits the fan, don’t say we didn’t warn you,"" updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant.",0,Liberty Headlines
"""Obamacare was patterned after (Mitt Romney's) plan in Massachusetts."" He calls it ""Obamneycare.""
That's the word that candidate Tim Pawlenty uses to express the similarity between the 2010 national health care law signed by President Barack Obama and the 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney.
Pawlenty, a former two-term governor of Minnesota, hesitated to push that attack during a debate in June. But with the race for the Republican nomination tightening up, he made the point forcefully at the Aug. 11, 2011, debate in Ames, Iowa.
""Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts. And for Mitt or anyone else to say that there aren't substantial similarities or they're not essentially the same plan, it just isn't credible. So that's why I called it Obamneycare, and I think that's a fair label, and I'm happy to call it that again tonight,"" Pawlenty said.
So are the national health plan and the Massachusetts plan that similar? In a word, Yes.
We've explored their similarities before in previous fact-checks, when liberals have made similar statements defending the Obama plan against critics who labeled it extreme.
We'll review the two plans' similarities again here.
• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.
• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The federal law sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill isn't quite a mandate. Instead, employers pay fines only if their workers qualify for tax credits to buy insurance.
• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.
• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.
• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. They handle the individual and small-group markets differently. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26.
Still, there are some differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest differences:
• Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue.
• Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (""Cadillac"") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.
We should note that the plans are so similar, we made a quiz, selecting passages from each plan to see if our readers could tell the difference. ( Take the quiz yourself! )
Pawlenty said that ""Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts."" In rating that statement, we noticed that Pawlenty phrased his statement carefully. He didn't say it was the same plan, but instead said that the national law was ""patterned"" after the Massachusetts law, and they had ""substantial similarities."" He's correct that the plans, thought not completely identical, are very similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid.",1,Tim Pawlenty
"John McCain ""has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate."" Nuclear proliferation is one of those arcane-but-important issues that tends to get pushed into the shadows during presidential campaigns. But as Sen. John McCain tries to distance himself from Bush administration policies, he's using the topic to help make his case.
In a May 27, 2008, speech in Denver, McCain endorsed seeking a new disarmament treaty with Russia and said he was open to re-evaluating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on underground nuclear tests that he voted against in 1999. Additionally, McCain called for eliminating the ""bunker buster"" that President Bush supports.
Experts say the positions put McCain in a more centrist camp than Bush on the question of how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. They may also reflect a desire by McCain to steal some of his Democratic rival's thunder. Sen. Barack Obama has made nonproliferation something of a specialty during his 3 years in the Senate, partly by virtue of his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Responding to McCain's speech, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton charged the veteran Arizona senator was playing catch-up, and asserted that Obama has been the more prominent player on nonproliferation during his brief tenure in the chamber.
""By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama's nonproliferation agenda today, John McCain highlighted Obama's leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate,"" Burton said.
He's got it right. Obama last year teamed with Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to write a nuclear nonproliferation bill that, among other things, called for disarmament talks with Russia and for ratifying a global ban on nuclear testing, and strengthened efforts to halt the transfer of weapons and fissile material. Portions of the bill dealing with terrorist threats were incorporated into a fiscal 2008 Foreign Operations spending bill enacted into law. Obama also collaborated with Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., on enacting a 2007 law allowing the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful purposes for the first time in three decades. President Bush praised it for increasing the transparency of India's civilian nuclear program.
McCain certainly has been a key player on many thorny and controversial issues during his long Senate career, among them campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and national security by virtue of his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. But a look at his record on nonproliferation shows he mostly showed up for key votes but didn't influence debates.
During a 2004 debate on a fiscal 2005 defense authorization bill, McCain endorsed the continuation of the nuclear bunker buster by voting against a Democratic amendment that would have eliminated money for studying the weapon and for research efforts into low-yield nuclear weapons. The amendment was rejected 42-55.
As he noted in the Denver speech, McCain in 1999 voted with a majority of Republicans against the Test Ban Treaty, a pact that garnered attention after nuclear tests in India and Pakistan increased tension between the countries. Conservatives at the time questioned how the ban would affect the long-term prospects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, and thought then-President Bill Clinton's desire to set an example to the global community by ratifying the treaty was misguided. The pact – which the Senate rejected, 48-51 – also required the approval of the 44 nations with nuclear capability; at the time of vote, only 26 had approved it.
In 1997, McCain was among 29 of 55 Republicans who joined with 45 Democrats to ratify the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the development, production, sale, use or stockpiling of chemical weapons. And in 1992, he voted with the majority of the Senate in a 93-6 tally to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which provided for reduction of about one-third in the arsenals of long-range missiles and bombers of the United States and former Soviet Union.
""The majority of people following the issue would point out McCain has not taken a leadership role on nonproliferation during his career in the Senate,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association.
In spite of McCain's moves to the center, and his more fleshed-out positions on nonproliferation, we don't find much in McCain's Senate record to refute the charge of the Obama camp. We say, True.",1,Barack Obama
"Huckabee ""granted 1,033 pardons and commutations . . . more clemencies than the previous three governors combined."" In a TV ad, Mitt Romney tries to portray Mike Huckabee as soft on crime because Huckabee ""granted 1,033 pardons and commutations."" The ad says Huckabee's number is ""more clemencies than the previous three governors combined"" and says that Romney himself has not issued any pardons.
We find Romney is accurately describing Huckabee's record. The 1,033 total for Huckabee's 10 years in office comes from an Associated Press examination of Huckabee's pardons and commutations. The Arkansas Secretary of State's office told PolitiFact the count was 1,058, which is not significantly different. Romney's claim that Huckabee granted more clemencies ""than the previous three governors combined"" also is correct according to the totals from the Secretary of State.
State officials in Massachusetts confirm Romney's record. He had about 150 applications for pardons and 80 applications for commuting sentences in his four-year term. He granted none.
The result is a striking difference: Huckabee has granted more than 1,000, while Romney hasn't granted any (although he has said he would consider pardoning White House aide Scooter Libby because the case involved an overzealous prosecutor).
Huckabee, a Baptist minister, says he was trying to give a second chance to people who had been convicted of minor crimes.
""A lot of (the pardons) that I gave were for 35-year-old single moms with kids who wanted to get a job anywhere in a nursing home emptying a bed pan, but because of the background check couldn't because when they were 18 they'd written a hot check,"" he said in a Dec. 19 interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe.
Huckabee even pardoned Keith Richards, a guitarist for the Rolling Stones who had an outstanding ticket for reckless driving.
By contrast, Romney has a zero-tolerance approach. ""I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury,"" he said during a June 2007 debate.
When he was asked about his policy in December 2006, Romney replied ""We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity."" He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.
In interviews, Huckabee has portrayed Romney as a political opportunist who took a hard line on pardons to appear tough on crime, while Huckabee's pardons were politically risky but better for the people of Arkansas.
""Now, if I'd played politics with all those people, I wouldn't have ever granted one single clemency, not one,"" Huckabee said on MSNBC.  ""But this shouldn't be about playing politics with people's lives. It ought to be about looking at every case with honesty, making decisions.  And, yes, sometimes they don't turn out so brilliantly. I've made mistakes. But I've tried to make the mistake on the ledger of thinking what would be in the best interest of all of us. Do I want this person unemployed for the rest of their life?""",1,Mitt Romney
"""Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out."" Democrats are pleading for patience as they try to reassure the country that the online insurance marketplaces critical to President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul can be fixed.
Big programs have seen rocky rollouts only to achieve success later, they say. Their top example: the 2005 launch of Medicare Part D, President George W. Bush’s prescription drug benefit plan.
""Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out,"" Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Nov. 6. ""When things go wrong, there are two things we can do as a country. We can spend all our time figuring out who to blame, or we can spend all our time figuring out how to fix it.""
Eight years after it went live, Medicare Part D is now widely popular among the seniors who use it.
Were there major problems with the rollout of Medicare Part D? And were they comparable to the challenges facing Obamacare? We decided to take a more a detailed look at its implementation.
Strangely similar
Let’s play a quick game: who made this statement?
""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches.""
A Democrat in 2013? Wrong! Actually, it was Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about Medicare Part D in 2006 .
The similarities between the two health care programs, both heralded as the signature domestic achievements of the presidents who signed them into law, are at times eerie. Supporters of the laws asked for time and promised a quick fix. Critics did not mince their words. Even the lingo -- words like ""glitches"" -- has been recycled.
A report documenting the history of Medicare Part D was released earlier this year by a group of health policy experts at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar.
For one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances.
Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.)
The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didn’t go live until weeks later in November. Even then, ""the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing,"" the Washington Post reported at the time.
""Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly,"" the Post reported. (Sensing a pattern?)
Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had ""accuracy problems,"" and local organizations designated with assisting seniors ""reported problems getting necessary and accurate information."" Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated ""the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided"" and ""service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information.""
The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the country’s experience with Medicare Part D suggested ""the experience will be far from perfect"" and ""problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found.""
These days, nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it.
""There’s really a striking amount of similarity even though this time it’s a far larger and daunting task. It’s a fair comparison,"" said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. ""Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems.""
Still different
But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different.
Because it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush.
""The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans,"" Brailer said. ""People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I don’t remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices.""
Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldn’t even get far enough to review what options were available.
Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated.
""For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy,"" Hoadley said. ""The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude.""
And there’s the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits.
When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue.
The New York Times reported in 2006 that ""about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program.""
By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government.
Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a ""two-front war"" Bush did not have to fight.
""On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem,"" he said. ""But you’re also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics.""",1,Steve Israel
"Hillary Clinton ""starts off with 47 percent of the country against her."" Sen. Barack Obama often speaks about how he believes he will be a stronger general election candidate than his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton.
At a campaign stop in Alexandria, Va., on Feb. 10, 2008, he brought up the negative opinions some people have of Clinton, who is well known to most voters from her time as first lady.
""I think Sen. Clinton starts off with 47 percent of the country against her. That's a hard place to start if you want to win the election,"" he said.
Pollsters regularly ask voters whether they rate candidates positively or negatively. Indeed, Clinton's negatives are consistently higher than Obama's, but different polls show her at different levels.
We looked at the times the USA Today /Gallup Poll asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, going back to January 2007. Her negative percentage fluctuated between 40 and 52, but the average of 21 polls came out to 47.
ABC News and the Washington Post have asked the question at least four times since January 2007. Her unfavorable ratings on that poll came in between 48 and 40, with an average of 44.5. CNN polled four times and found unfavorables between 39 and 44, with an average of 41.5.
Obama's unfavorable ratings tend to be well under 40 percent. In several polls, his unfavorable ratings are in the 20s.
Not every poll rates her unfavorables consistently as high as 47 percent, and poll numbers are always a little bit squishy. But, the USA Today /Gallup Poll has polled often on Clinton's unfavorables, and the average of 21 polls puts her negatives at 47 percent.",1,Barack Obama
"Hillary Clinton ""actually differed with (John McCain) by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions."" Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican frontrunner after winning Florida's primary.
In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things.
After naming a number of areas where he said Clinton and McCain had the same positions, Obama attacked Clinton for diverging from McCain on the issue of torture.  Clinton ""actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed,"" Obama said.
It sounds a little convoluted, so here's the step-by-step.
In October 2006, Clinton spoke about exceptions to a no-torture policy when speaking to the New York Daily News. Clinton mentioned a ""ticking time bomb"" scenario in which a captured terrorist has knowledge of an imminent terror attack and interrogators want to use torture.
""In the event we were ever confronted with having to interrogate a detainee with knowledge of an imminent threat to millions of Americans, then the decision to depart from standard international practices must be made by the president, and the president must be held accountable,"" she said.
""That very, very narrow exception within very, very limited circumstances is better than blasting a big hole in our entire law.""
Then, on Sept. 26, 2007, Clinton said something different. During a debate, Tim Russert asked her about the ticking bomb scenario and here's what she said: ""As a matter of policy, it cannot be American policy, period."" She said she met with military generals who told her there is ""very little evidence that it works.""
In the days after the debate, the Republican National Committee criticized her for flip-flopping, and Obama said he would oppose torture ""without exception or equivocation,"" according to Daily News reports.
Did Clinton change position because of her talks with the generals or because of the ""politics of the moment""? We can't see inside Clinton's head, so our ruling doesn't reflect on that part of the statement. But it is clear she changed her mind about the ""ticking bomb"" scenario.",1,Barack Obama
"""The people in Massachusetts like (the state health care plan) by about a 3-1 margin."" Comments about Mitt Romney's support of the Massachusetts health care plan prompted a testy exchange during the CNN Republican debate in Las Vegas.
It began with former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum making an aside that Romney's plan ""was the basis for Obamacare. Your consultants helped Obama craft Obamacare.""
Romney said he had consistently said it was""crafted for Massachusetts. It would be wrong to adopt this as a nation."" That prompted a feisty back-and-forth with head-shaking and interruptions.
When the dust settled, Romney said, ""It was something crafted for a state. And I've said time and again, Obamacare is bad news. It's unconstitutional. It costs way too much money, a trillion dollars. And if I'm president of the United States, I will repeal it for the American people.""
ANDERSON COOPER: ""All right. Senator Santorum?""
SANTORUM: ""Mitt, the governor of Massachusetts just is coming forward saying we have to pick up the job left undone by Romneycare, which is doing something about cutting health care costs.
""What you did is exactly what Barack Obama did: focused on the wrong problem. Herman always says you've got to find the right problem. Well, the right problem is health care costs. What you did with a top-down, government-run program was focus on the problem of health care access. You expanded the pool of insurance without controlling costs. You've blown a hole in the budget up there. And you authored in Obamacare, which is going to blow a hole in the budget of this country.""
COOPER: ""Governor Romney, I'm going to give you 30 seconds.""
ROMNEY: ""I'm -- I'm sorry, Rick, that you find so much to dislike in my plan, but I'll tell you, the people in Massachusetts like it by about a 3-1 margin.""
Romney made a similar claim during last week's debate, so we checked it out.
We found one survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Boston Globe. Interviews with a sample of 537 respondents age 18 and older were conducted from May 24 to May 26, 2011.
The survey asked this question, among others: ""Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law?""
The pollsters found that 63 percent supported the law, 21 percent opposed the law, 6 percent didn’t know, and 9 percent hadn’t heard of the law. The ratio of 63 percent support and 21 percent opposition is exactly 3 to 1, supporting Romney’s claim. (Support is actually up compared to a previous Harvard-Globe poll in 2009, when the breakdown was 53 percent to 25 percent, or slightly over 2 to 1.)
And such levels of support don’t appear to be unusual. An annual survey sponsored by the Urban Institute and the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation has somewhat different methodology but found similar levels of support. Between 2006 and 2009, support for the law was, respectively, 69 percent, 71 percent, 72 percent and 67 percent. (We don’t know the exact ratio of support to opposition because the survey did not release the percentages for those who opposed the law or who had no opinion.)
""There is no discussion here of repealing the law,"" said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. ""Romney has it right in the sense that residents in Massachusetts don't want to repeal the law.""",1,Mitt Romney
"John McCain and George Bush have ""absolutely no plan for universal health care."" After attacking Sen. John McCain and President George W. Bush on Iraq, taxes and energy, an ad from the Campaign to Defend America finally turns to health care.
""Absolutely no plan for universal health care. McSame as Bush.""
Universal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care — the intention to cover every person with no exceptions — there must be a legal requirement for care, such as a mandate for individuals to buy insurance . In the Democratic primary campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton supports an individual mandate, while Sen. Barack Obama opposes it on the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor.
Bush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain.
""On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,"" Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner.
At a health care forum on Oct. 31, 2007, hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, McCain said he opposed mandates, even while discussing plans to improve access to health care.
""I don't think that there should be a mandate for every American to have health insurance. I think that one of our goals should be that every American own their own home. But I'm not going to mandate that every American own their own home,"" McCain said.
McCain does have a health care plan, but there's no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal.",1,Campaign to Defend America
"""The legislation ... that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity."" Libertarian presidential candidate and ex-Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr may have turned his back on his old party, but he hasn't abandoned his crusade to limit the reach of federal law enforcement.
Asked on Fox News about the differences between himself and presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain, Barr pointed to a compromise plan to overhaul electronic spying rules that the Senate took up before the July Fourth recess and that McCain supports.
The legislation is intended to address some of the privacy concerns that arose after the 2005 disclosure of the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program. It would rewrite the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA – the law that governs surveillance of foreign terrorist suspects – and permit warrantless eavesdropping on foreign targets who may be communicating with people in the United States, although with some court supervision of the surveillance procedures. The House passed the bill in a 293-129 vote on June 20.
What most irks civil libertarians like Barr is the way the plan leaves it to the government to decide if it's violating Americans' privacy rights.
""The legislation that is now pending before the Senate, that just passed the House, that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity,"" Barr said.
Barr's characterization is essentially correct. The plan allows the attorney general and director of national intelligence to authorize surveillance of a suspect for up to one year without a warrant if the target is ""reasonably believed to be located outside the United States (and) to acquire foreign intelligence information."" That would include conversations between the target and people in the United States, including citizens. There is no requirement that the suspect be explicitly connected to any terrorist or criminal activity, though the bill's definition of foreign intelligence information includes sabotage, international terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Before any surveillance begins, a secret FISA court would have to review the executive branch's targeting process. But the administration could begin surveillance before the court review if it declares ""exigent,"" or urgent, circumstances.
Though the government has argued its activities are only directed at foreigners overseas, skeptics such as James X. Dempsey, policy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology, contend it is virtually certain that some suspects will communicate with people in the United States, where constitutional protections apply to national security activities. To assure the expansion of surveillance powers won't gut Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, many critics believe the government should first establish probable cause, by obtaining a warrant from a court that decides whether the activities are reasonably designed to intercept terrorists' communications while not infringing on the rights of innocent Americans.
However, the administration and its allies in Congress have continuously resisted requirements for prior court reviews of surveillance procedures, citing, among other things, the president's constitutional authority to protect the United States and a 2001 law authorizing the use of force against groups or nations involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Democratic leaders in Congress reluctantly went along in the current debate, saying the compromise was preferable to a White House-backed plan that would have required less court and congressional oversight.
The FISA law, as it's informally known, does not permit the targeting of a U.S. citizen overseas without such a warrant. And the plan under consideration in Congress contains some safeguards to protect ""reverse targeting"" of Americans while outlining so-called ""minimization"" procedures intended to limit the information that can be retained and disseminated on U.S. citizens.
Still, as written, the plan would permit the government under certain circumstances to listen to Americans without a warrant. And it would not require the executive branch to demonstrate that a  suspect is engaged in terrorist or criminal activity. For these reasons, we deem Barr's claim True.",1,Bob Barr
"""The mayor said … 'if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status . . . then we welcome you here.  We want you here.  We'll protect you here.' "" At the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg on Nov. 28, 2007, Mitt Romney tried to use Rudy Giuliani's words to make him look soft on illegal immigration.
The full quote from Romney: ""The mayor said -- and I quote almost verbatim -- which is 'if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status - and that means you're here illegally - then we welcome you here.  We want you here.  We'll protect you here.'""
Romney is referring to a statement Giuliani made at a 1994 news conference: ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""
Romney says that shows Giuliani is too welcoming to illegal immigrants and that his policies made New York a ""sanctuary city."" We've addressed the sanctuary city debate in this item and this article, so we'll simply focus here on the quote.
Indeed, Romney accurately summarized what Giuliani said. The quote came from a 1994 story in the New York Times that was headlined ""New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal.""
The article noted that Giuliani had given a ""spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City."" It quoted him saying, ""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens. ""
Giuliani has not denied the comment but, in discussing immigration, has emphasized the need for more border security and tougher enforcement by the federal government.",1,Mitt Romney
"""For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three."" During an overseas trip to Afghanistan, Sen. Barack Obama said the United States needed to focus on the war there, calling the situation ""precarious and urgent,"" adding ""I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism.""
""For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three,"" he said.
We consulted the record to see if Obama had urged more troops for Afghanistan that long.
Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.
The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. ""If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will,"" Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings about Obama's stance on Pakistan here , here and here. )
But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan.
""Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve,"" Obama said. ""As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban.""
That speech was the first time we could find of Obama specifically advocating for more brigades to Afghanistan. Technically speaking, the time from his speech on Aug. 1, 2007, to his more recent statement is 10 days short of a year. But it's pretty darn close, and it's likely that speech reflected policy crafted over a longer period than 10 days.",1,Barack Obama
"Says Craig Huey called Planned Parenthood a ""murder mill."" A new campaign video from California congressional candidate Janice Hahn, a Democratic Los Angeles city councilwoman, is remarkable not so much for its attacks on her opponent Republican Craig Huey -- it's fairly standard abortion and the-Republicans-want-to-end-Medicare fare -- but rather for its efforts to tie Huey's positions to that of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.
""Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey,"" the narrator begins.
""Which supports a radical plan to end Medicare, but wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy? Palin and Huey again.""
""But which one called Planned Parenthood a 'murder mill'? Only Craig Huey. We don't need Craig Huey's extremist right wing agenda.""
The Palin cameo is an intriguing political strategy, one that appears to bank on Palin's negative baggage.
""They clearly see Palin as a polarizing figure,"" said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. ""And so the more closely they can tie Huey to Palin the better."" The ad appears to be aimed at sparking larger voter turnout in the heavily Democratic Los Angeles district, he said.
Huey, a business consultant and political commentator, and Hahn are facing off in a July 12 special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who retired in February.
In this item, we are going to focus our fact-check on the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a ""murder mill."" In a separate item we will focus on whether both Palin and Huey ""would ban a woman's right to choose in every case.""
We have dealt with similar Democratic claims that Republican support for dramatic reforms to Medicare means they want to end Medicare, and we have concluded those claims go too far.
This comes from a post to electionforum.org, on May 5, 2011: The murder mill keeps churning
This makes me sick.
Planned Parenthood gets $350 million in tax dollars each year—nearly $1 million dollars a day. For this, it kills more than 325,000 babies annually. A thousand dollars per abortion…
When we first put that quote to Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Huey's campaign, he said Huey did not recall ever having used that language to describe Planned Parenthood, though he does want to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions.
When presented with a link to the post, Gilliard consulted with Huey and said it appeared a staffer for Huey wrote the post.
""From what we can tell, that was posted on his website,"" Gilliard said. ""It's not his language. But he's standing by it, because it's on his website.""

"Sarah Palin ""has had 12 years of elected office experience."" The day after John McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate for the presidential campaign, McCain defended his pick from questions about her experience.
Chris Wallace, who interviewed McCain on Aug. 30, 2008, for Fox News Sunday , asked McCain several questions about why he selected Palin. Here's one exchange:
Wallace: ""You have criticized Obama as being, quote, 'dangerously unprepared to be president.' In the sense of national security and foreign policy specifically, isn't Sarah Palin even more dangerously unprepared?""
McCain: ""Oh, no. Look, she has got the right judgment. She has got the right judgment. She doesn't think, like Senator Obama does, that Iran is a minor irritant. ( That's a claim we previously ruled False. ) She knows that the surge worked and succeeded, and she supported that. ...
""So she has had 12 years of elected office experience, including traveling to Kuwait (as governor to visit the state's National Guard), including being involved in these issues. And look, I'm so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive. She has run a huge economy up there in the state of Alaska. Twenty percent of our energy comes from the state of Alaska, and energy is obviously one of the key issues for our nation's security.""
Here, we'll examine McCain's claim that Palin has 12 years of elected office experience.
Palin first took elected office in 1992, when she was elected to the city council of Wasilla, a town of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, near the city of Anchorage.
She served on the council until she made her first run for mayor in 1996, ousting a longtime incumbent. (The vote was 617 to 413, according to press reports from the time.) She won a second three-year term as mayor, serving until 2002. Counting her time as mayor and on the council, Palin spent 10 years of elected office in Wasilla's municipal government.
In 2002, Palin ran for lieutenant governor and lost. She did not run for elected offfice again until 2006, when she won the race for Alaska's governor, ousting incumbent Frank Murkowski in the primary and then beating Democrat Tony Knowles in the election, 114,697 votes to 97,238. She took office on Dec. 4, 2006.
Palin was about three month's short of two years in the governor's office when McCain made his remarks, but we'll round up because it would be 12 years total elected experience if the ticket wins and takes office in January 2009. We rule McCain's statement True.",1,John McCain
"MikeHuckabee.com gets ""more hits than virtually any other presidential candidate."" A November 2007 poll has Mike Huckabee leading Republicans in Iowa, putting fear into his big-name presidential opponents. That mirrors his popularity on the Web, where he has the right to crow.
Since Nov. 17, Ron Paul has been the only candidate to get more Internet traffic than the former governor of Arkansas. Huckabee's site beat out front-runners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Rudy Giuliani.
Huckabee gets credit for choosing his words carefully. By saying his site gets more hits than ""virtually""  any other candidate, he keeps it just vague enough to avoid running into trouble.
Huckabee's online fame has been growing slowly for weeks.
In September, less than 10 percent of Web users who went to presidential campaign sites checked out Huckabee's site, according to Hitwise.com, which uses a sample of 10-million Web users to track traffic to all types of Internet sites.
By mid November, visits to Huckabee's site outnumbered every other candidate but Paul, according to Hitwise. On Nov. 24, nearly 19 percent of Web visitors who went to campaign sites checked out Huckabee's site. That same week, about 26 percent visited Paul's site. Obama was third, with 10 percent.
MikeHuckabee.com features an online store, where supporters can buy T-shirts and baby bibs that read ""I Like Mike."" There's also a Webisode where actor Chuck Norris discusses why he endorsed Huckabee.
So, why the new popularity?
""Mike Huckabee is now being talked about as a possible winner of Iowa and people are now interested in him,"" said Joshua Levy, associate editor of www.techpresident.com. ""The Republicans aren't that satisfied with their slate. Rudy Giuliani is a really unorthodox candidate for that base. Mitt Romney isn't really inspiring. So you got this guy, Mike Huckabee, who has been inching towards the top for a while. He is getting a lot of buzz in general.""
Huckabee's success on the Web could also be attributed to voter curiosity. For the most part, Giuliani, Clinton and Obama are well-known figures whose stories have been paraded in the press for years. No need to Google them. Huckabee is not as familiar, so interested voters are going to check out his site.
""It's been a long year,"" said Julie Barko Germany, deputy director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University. ""So fresh faces like Ron Paul and Huckabee are starting to get a little more attention.""
While www.mikehuckabee.com might never share the same celebrity as www.myspace.com or www.thefacebook.com, for now Huckabee has the right to brag about his Web popularity. Given his use of the word ""virtually,"" we give him a ruling of True.",1,Mike Huckabee
"""McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician."" An independent political group called Campaign Money Watch has begun airing a TV ad that paints Sen. John McCain as a bought-and-paid-for politician who swung a lucrative defense contract to a European company over an American competitor.
The issue is McCain's role in a highly contentious and much-publicized battle over a contract to build a fleet of air refueling tankers for the Air Force. Chicago-based Boeing has been at odds with a rival bidder, a partnership between U.S.-based Northrop Grumman and European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), the parent company of Airbus.
To the surprise of many, Airbus was awarded the roughly $40-billion contract in March 2008, but the General Accounting Office upheld a protest from Boeing, concluding that the Air Force made a number of errors in the bidding process. The contract will now be re-bid.
What's interesting about this attack is that McCain's role in this particular defense project has long been seen as one of taxpayer hero. The whole reason there was a competitive bid for a contract to build the tankers is because McCain led a charge to scrap the Air Force's original plan, which was to lease jetliners from Boeing. As McCain made noise, government studies concluded that costs for the lease plan had been vastly underestimated. People were fired, some went to jail. It was a big scandal, and McCain has rightly claimed credit for it on the trail.
None of that background appears in the ad. The ad claims McCain's campaign has been too cozy with Airbus.
An announcer in the TV ad states: ""Seven of McCain's staff and fundraisers lobbied for Airbus"" and  ""McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.""
The ad is on target when it calls out McCain for having seven campaign staffers and fundraisers who lobbied for Airbus; and for accepting contributions from Airbus executives.
Former McCain finance chairman Thomas G. Loeffler's firm lobbied for Airbus parent company EADS. Loeffler's lobbying ties led to his departure from the McCain campaign in March. Susan E. Nelson left Loeffler's lobbying firm to be McCain's finance director. William L. Ball III, a former secretary of the Navy and frequent McCain surrogate, and John Green, who took a leave from Ogilvy Public Relations to serve as McCain's legislative liaison, also have lobbied for EADS. And three McCain fundraising bundlers — Kirk Blalock, Kirsten Chadwick and Aleix Jarvis — are with Fierce Isakowitz & Blalock, which has done lobbying work for EADS, according to campaign finance records at Opensecrets.org and Public Citizen.
As for political contributions, the ad states that ""McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.""
The Center for Responsive Politics prepared a report for PolitiFact that backs that up. U.S. employees of EADS/Airbus have contributed $15,700 in this election cycle to McCain's campaign. The next highest recipient was Mark Warner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, who has gotten $2,800. Barack Obama has gotten $2,650. Neither McCain nor Obama has gotten any money from Airbus PACs, which have spread around $123,000 to 22 congressional candidates this election cycle.
Given those numbers, we rule this claim True.",1,Campaign Money Watch
"""I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel."" Ron Paul, the only Republican candidate for president who opposes the war and one of the most ardent antiwar candidates in both parties, is on the money here.
The Center for Responsive Politics reports that since January, he has received at least $53,670 from U.S. military personnel. The Houston Chronicle, after an extensive analysis of Federal Election Commission reports, puts the figure at $63,440 for the same period.
The disparity in the figures is caused by the complicated nature of campaign contributions.
Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for CRP, speculates that the difference between their numbers and those of the Chronicle are because the newspaper had access to small contributions and was more familiar with the military connections of people who might not have listed the military as their employer.
Regardless, Paul is right that he's on top.
Both sources say Democratic candidate Barack Obama comes in second, with CRP reporting he has received $45,200 from military folks. The Houston paper says active and retired military personnel funneled $53,968 to Obama's campaign.
""What we were hearing from the donors is that this money was definitely a statement about the war,"" Ritsch said. ""It doesn't mean it reflects the views of anyone else in the military. It just may be the way this small slice of people is making a statement, because it's one of the ways they can make a statement. If you're active military, there aren't too many ways you can protest the mission you've been assigned.""
John McCain comes in third, with CRP reporting he received $40,000 and the Chronicle saying $48,208. McCain was a Vietnam War prisoner and backs the surge in Iraq.",1,Ron Paul
"""Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."" Are Democratic presidents better than Republican presidents at job creation? Former President Bill Clinton said so -- forcefully -- in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.
""Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24,"" Clinton said. ""In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."" In the packed convention hall, it was one of the night’s biggest applause lines.
In 2010, we checked a similar claim from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said that Democratic presidents ""have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs."" After crunching the numbers back to President Harry Truman, we found that jobs did indeed grow faster under Democratic presidents when adjusted for a president’s years served in office. So we rated the claim True .
Clinton’s claim at the convention was worded differently, so we quickly re-crunched the numbers based on his specifications.
Let’s cut to the chase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here are the net increases in private-sector employment under each president, chronologically by party:
Republicans
Richard Nixon: Increase of 7.1 million jobs
Gerald Ford: Increase of 1.3 million jobs
Ronald Reagan: Increase of 14.7 million jobs
George H.W. Bush: Increase of 1.5 million jobs
George W. Bush: Decline of 646,000 jobs
Total: Increase of 23.9 million jobs under Republican presidents
Democrats
John F. Kennedy: Increase of 2.7 million jobs
Lyndon B. Johnson: Increase of 9.5 million jobs
Jimmy Carter: Increase of 9.0 million jobs
Bill Clinton: Increase of 20.8 million jobs
Barack Obama: Increase of 332,000 jobs
Total: Increase of 42.3 million jobs.
So Clinton is right. But we’ll bring up a few points worth noting.
This does not include government jobs
The combination of private-sector jobs and public-sector jobs is a broader measurement of job creation than private-sector alone. But excluding government jobs would presumably hurt Democrats more than Republicans, given the two parties’ historical stances toward the role of government. The fact that Democrats finished so far ahead despite taking government jobs off the table makes it a more impressive accomplishment.
The Democrats didn’t benefit from population growth
For our previous story, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless calculated that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, also making the Democratic accomplishment more impressive.
Presidents deserves less credit for the good times and less blame for the bad times
It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes.
Since we published our previous story, we have changed our policy: We now factor into our ratings whether the politician or party deserves credit or blame for the statistical trend being analyzed. In this item, though, we will not factor in credit or blame, because both parties have had presidents serve during the time we looked at, meaning that both parties would have benefited and suffered in roughly equal proportions.
It’s unclear how much this finding says about our political and economic systems
Job creation for each president depended to a certain extent on timing, external factors and luck. And as Yale political scientist David Mayhew pointed out for our previous story, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt.",1,Bill Clinton
"""Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama."" The pundits and prognosticators are saying President Barack Obama is losing his mojo.
And they have facts to back up their claim.
""Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama,"" said Republican Newt Gingrich, offering advice to Obama on the op-ed page of the
Washington Post.
Gingrich's comment was part of a roundup of advice solicited by the
Post
for the supposedly faltering president; Gingrich advised Obama to reject his left-leaning supporters and move to the center.
Being but humble fact-checkers, we can't speak to the wisdom or folly of Gingrich's advice. But we certainly can check his factual statement about Obama's poll numbers, a claim we've seen repeated in other media.
The Gallup poll actually has been tracking presidential approval ratings since World War II. We consulted Gallup's tracking polls and found that Gingrich is correct. At the seven-month mark, Obama's approval rating was 51 percent. The only two presidents doing worse than Obama were Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton.
Interestingly, Ford and Clinton finished their presidencies with decidely different outcomes.
Ford's public approval ratings dropped below 50 percent about three months into his presidency. Those numbers improved slightly and plateaued over the next few years. But Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter.
Clinton's approval ratings dropped below 50 percent four months into his presidency, falling even further during his first year in office to the high 30s. There were a few more ups and downs during his first term, but he won re-election in 1996 and finished his term in 2001 with approval ratings above 60 percent, despite being impeached by the House of Representatives after a sex scandal.
Make of all this what you will. We've looked into Gingrich's statement and found that he is correct.",1,Newt Gingrich
"John Raese's wife ""is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him."" In what's becoming a familiar story, a longtime public official is facing a significant threat from an upstart challenger. In this case, the race is for the U.S. Senate seat for West Virginia formerly held by the late Robert Byrd, a Democrat. Gov. Joe Manchin, also a Democrat, was considered the favorite, but John Raese, a Republican businessman, has been showing strength in the polls.
So Manchin recently released a harsh attack ad against Raese. Here's how it goes:
""John Raese thinks we're hicks. His people hired actors from Philadelphia to attack Joe Manchin and told them to dress 'hicky.' It's insulting and he didn't even apologize. Then there's the fact Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes. Obviously, we're not good enough for him. Raese's wife is registered to vote in Florida so she can't even vote for him. Why should we?""
There's a lot to unpack there. Let's start with the ""hicky"" charge before moving onto our fact-check.
The ""hicky"" incident arose from an attack ad against Manchin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee put together. The ad shows three men in a diner talking about how they don't want to vote for Manchin because he would support President Barack Obama. The men are wearing flannel shirts and trucker hats, but other than that, it seems like a straightforward ""man on the street"" type of ad.
The controversy came when Politico reported on the advertisement looking for actors in Philadelphia to portray the men at the diner.
""We are going for a 'Hicky' Blue Collar look,"" read the casting call for the ad. ""These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miner/trucker looks.""
""Clothing Suggestions"" included jeans, work boots, flannel shirt, denim shirt, ""Dickie's type jacket with t-shirt underneath,"" down-filled vest, ""John Deer [sic] hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" ""trucker hats (not brand new, preferably beat up),"" according to Politico. Several days after those descriptions came to light, the NRSC fired the firm that was responsible.
We weren't as interested in the 'hicky' controversy as we were in the claims about Raese's Florida connections. We asked the Raese campaign for a response, but we didn't hear back. So we started by checking the voter registration rolls in Florida, which are public records.
We quickly determined that Raese's wife, Elizabeth Raese, is registered to vote in Palm Beach County. She has been registered since 2001 and last voted in the 2008 election, according to the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections.
We also cross-checked her address with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser. Property records indicate Elizabeth and John Raese own a 6,934 square foot home purchased in 1999 and with a market value of $2.67 million. The 2010 record also shows that the Raese's receive a homestead exemption, which indicates that the home is an owner's primary residence.
We spoke with officials at the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's office. They confirmed that the Raese's did qualify for the exemption for the 2010 tax year, and that Elizabeth Raese is registered to vote in Florida and holds a Florida driver's license. John Raese is listed as ""owner non-resident"" in the appraiser's records. The officials confirmed that it's possible for a married couple to jointly own property and claim an exemption when only one spouse is the Florida homeowner.
It might seem strange to have a spouse who is an official resident of a state different from your own, but the Raese's wealth may account for the arrangement. Raese's campaign biography states, ""Despite a long list of business accomplishments throughout a lifetime, John is most proud of his family – wife Liz and two wonderful daughters Jane and Agnes. Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia, a growing group of activists charting a conservative path for the Mountain State."" (Press reports indicate his children attend a private Christian school in Florida.)
The ad further states that ""Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes."" Florida does not have a personal income tax and West Virginia does, but this claim is impossible for us to check: Tax information is confidential unless a candidate chooses to release it. Raese hasn't done that.
But a campaign spokesman told the Charleston Gazette that Raese does pay taxes in West Virginia. ""John Raese is a West Virginia resident. Period. He pays income and property taxes there, and any attempts to claim otherwise are acts of desperation by a hopelessly listing campaign,"" said spokesman Kevin McLaughlin.
The Gazette also reported that Raese owns a home in Morgantown, W. Va., listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and that he is registered to vote in Monongalia County.
Raese has run for office before and had his residency questioned by opponents. But Raese's campaign biography and independent press reports indicate that he is a longtime West Virginia resident. He serves as president and CEO of Greer Industries, a steel and limestone company founded by his grandparents and headquartered in Morgantown, W. Va.
Manchin's ad tries to make voters question Raese's loyalty to West Virginia. It's hard to make a case that Raese isn't someone with longtime ties to West Virginia. On the other hand, it's true that his wife is registered to vote in Florida, and that's the fact we're checking here. Public records confirm she is registered to vote in Florida and receives a homestead exemption on her property.",1,Joe Manchin
"""Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month."" The number of people on food stamps plummeted nationwide in November, according to Breitbart, a conservative news website.
""Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month,"" stated the Feb. 7 headline .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
We found that the numbers are accurate, but as the story explained, the decline occurred after a spike as a result of a program to temporarily provide food stamps to people in areas damaged by hurricanes.
Ultimately, the number of food stamp clients in November was on par with many of the preceding months before the impacts of Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
Data showed spike followed by decline in food stamps in the fall
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal government program to help low-income people buy groceries. The average per person monthly benefit was around $126 last year.
Breitbart accurately quoted monthly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which showed that the number of participants in SNAP dropped from about 45.7 million in October 2017 to 41.7 million in November 2017 — a decrease of about four million.
Breitbart explained that the decline was preceded by an increase following temporary Disaster-SNAP enrollment in Florida and Texas after the hurricanes. Food stamp clients jumped by about three million between September and October nationwide after the USDA approved Disaster-SNAP for Florida and Texas .
Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said that DCF handed out these disaster benefits to 3.1 million people between late September and early December. In Texas, there were 1.6 million individuals served.
SNAP acts as a first responder after natural disasters, providing assistance to households that may be vulnerable as a result of their place of employment temporarily closing, or facing expenses due to damage or relocation, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Breitbart’s statement about the four-million drop in one month makes for a catchy headline, but if we put it in context and look at the data over a few months , it showed that the November enrollment of about 41.7 million is in the same ballpark as many of the past several months, for example in May when there were 41.6 million SNAP clients.
Experts told PolitiFact that monthly enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as disaster assistance, so it’s more useful to look at longer stretches such as annual data to understand trends.
Food stamps on the decline since 2013
Breitbart accurately noted that food stamp enrollment has been on the decline since fiscal year 2013.
Annual SNAP data shows enrollment climbed from about 28.2 million in 2008 to 47.6 million in 2013 and has declined every year since that time. SNAP enrollment hit 42.2 million in 2017.
SNAP enrollment fluctuates based on the economy . National enrollment climbed between 2007 and 2013 amid the recession and sluggish initial recovery.
The rising numbers were as a result of expanded eligibility and outreach, which began under President George W. Bush including a commitment to expand funding . Also, the 2009 stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama expanded eligibility.
So far there have been no explicit changes implemented to SNAP since Trump took office in January 2017 to give him credit for the decline, said James Ziliak, director of the center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky.
""To the extent that the economy has continued to grow under President Trump, including rising wages, then to the extent that his policies have not interfered with this pre-existing trend he deserves some credit,"" he said.
The Trump administration has made some moves toward work requirements for people who receive certain government services, including food stamps.
Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a press conference in May 2017 that people need to get a job to be eligible for food stamps going forward:
""If you’re on food stamps and you’re able-bodied, then we need you to go to work,"" he said.
The federal government has sought input from the states in an effort to promote employment for food stamp recipients.
According to the USDA , many SNAP households already have a person working.
Nearly one-third of all SNAP households and 55 percent of households with children had earnings in 2015.

"""Now, I also support the Bush tax cuts. Sen. McCain voted against them originally. He now believes they should be made permanent. I'm glad he agrees they should be made permanent."" Mitt Romney has repeatedly charged John McCain with flip-flopping on tax cuts. He points out that McCain twice voted against President Bush's tax changes before deciding to support them. He repeated his attack at the Republican debate in Boca Raton.
Though Romney omits some important details, we again find that he is accurately summarizing McCain's record.
In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. Two years later, McCain again citied spending for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs for the war in Iraq.
But in 2006, McCain changed position and voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years. He said not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering.
McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because ""American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.""
In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent.
""We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society,"" McCain said. ""Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today.""
McCain has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says.",1,Mitt Romney
"Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians."" It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks.
Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016.
Seth Rich , who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery.
WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder.
The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right.
But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter , saying their son was not WikiLeaks ’ source.
Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
""We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,"" Gingrich said on Fox May 21 . ""Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""
Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory.
Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails
The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15.
Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation.
Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC.
""But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"" asked the WTTG-TV reporter.
""Absolutely,"" Wheeler replied. ""Yeah, and that’s confirmed.""
The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders.
Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work.
""Let me just really quickly say this,"" Wheeler said on Hannity ’s show May 16. ""I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way.""
Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying ""the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.""
So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case.
The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity.
All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit.
Lots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails
The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints.
The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations.
There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example.
Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October , December and January . And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since.
""The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked,"" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing . ""The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years.""
There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack.
""The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing . ""Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data.""",0,Newt Gingrich
"""The median income of a middle class family went down $2,100 from 2001 to 2007."" Vice President Joe Biden visited a New Hampshire university Oct. 20, 2011, to promote President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act before an audience whom he called ""the 9/11 generation.""
Speaking to a full house inside Plymouth State University’s lecture hall, Biden talked about the need to restore the middle class and to bring jobs back to America. He said middle-income-earning Americans have been ""under siege,"" long before the economic recession hit.
""In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed,"" said Biden. ""During that period between 2001-07, productivity of American workers was up 20 percent, but median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 during this time.""
Did the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan?  We looked into Biden’s claim to find out.
First we contacted Biden’s staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households.
Tobin Marcus, Biden’s deputy economic policy adviser, told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households. ""We’re looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees,"" Marcus said.
""Working age households"" are typically considered houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners.
Biden’s office cited the Census Bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for 2000 and 2007 .
They said they compared inflation-adjusted numbers, using the ""annual average"" increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index .
We took a look at their numbers, and their calculations checked out.
To be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership.
He confirmed the calculations Biden’s campaign provided.
""I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly,"" Delay said.
Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute which used the same data. From 2000-07, the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007—a decrease of $2,114. The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a ""weak labor market"" and ""anemic job growth of the 2000s"" among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession.
""Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present),"" Delay said. ""But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don’t believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income.""",1,Joe Biden
"Says Mitt Romney ""has a corporation in Bermuda (but) failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures."" In the Democratic playbook, the more attention paid to Mitt Romney’s wealth, the better. Over the past few days, many Democrats questioned whether Romney used offshore holdings to dodge U.S. taxes and pressed him to release more of his personal financial information. Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs took the occasion during CNN’s State of the Union to say, ""Nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures.""
We wondered if Gibbs had his facts right. Does Romney currently have a stake in a Bermuda corporation? And did he fail to disclose it seven times?
Reporting by the Associated Press and Vanity Fair teed this up. Both news organizations explored one of Romney’s overseas accounts, Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The firm is described in SEC filings as ""a Bermuda corporation wholly owned by W. Mitt Romney."" (For more details, check out the AP's interesting account .)
In his 2010 tax return and his 2011 estimated filing, Romney includes Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The beginning balance is pegged at $10,432. He and his wife Ann are the sole owners.  According to the Associated Press, Romney ran his investments in other Bain Capital deals through this offshore corporation.
Democrats have pounced on the issue. Offshore holdings might be perfectly legal, but they also might paint Romney as one of the super-rich who may be using an offshore tax shelter.
Romney’s ownership of Sankaty is not in doubt, at least not as recently as this past December, according to Romney’s 2011 estimated tax return. So Gibbs appears to be on solid ground that Romney has the company now. We asked the Romney campaign if they could give us more current information on the status of Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, but they did not respond.
In an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday, Romney deflected the issue, saying his foreign investments are in a blind trust.
""I don’t manage them. I don’t even know where they are,"" Romney said. ""That trustee follows all U.S. laws. All the taxes are paid, as appropriate. All of them have been reported to the government. There’s nothing hidden there.""
As for Gibbs’ other assertion that Romney has failed to disclose his stake in Sankaty seven times, that also is largely accurate. We counted six disclosure forms where Romney made no reference at all to the Bermuda corporation. Those include his filings in Massachusetts when he was running for governor or holding office and his federal disclosures for his presidential bids.
The seventh appears to be his 2001 disclosure, which lists Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors LLC. Note the slight difference in those three letters -- LLC instead of Ltd. The LLC, a limited liability corporation he named on the form, is based in Delaware . The offshore corporation by the same name ends in Ltd. and there is no mention of it until Romney’s lawyers began amending his disclosures this year.
There is some question whether he was required to disclose this asset. In 2003, on the eve of running for governor, he put Sankaty into a blind trust. Thereafter, he disclosed the presence of the trust and might not have been required to say what was in it. It is also unclear whether the nominal value of Sankaty would be high enough to warrant disclosure.
In 2011, its value was $10,432. However, as the Associated Press pointed out, that could well ignore the potential income that might flow through the fund. It is possible for investments made many years ago to produce over $1 million in payoffs that suddenly appear on the books.",1,Robert Gibbs
"""Warren (Buffett) still does support me."" The Oracle of Omaha is still for Obama. So the president claimed on
60 Minutes
, interrupting interviewer Steve Kroft to tout the continued support of Warren Buffett, the Omaha-based stock-picker extraordinaire.
""Your plan really for solving the banking crisis was met with very, very, very tepid response,"" Kroft said to Obama. ""A lot of people said they didn't understand it. A lot of people said it didn't have any, enough details to solve the problem. I know you're coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your...""
""And Warren still does support me,"" Obama interjected. ""But I think that, understand, Warren's also a big player in the financial markets who's a major owner of Wells Fargo. And so he's got a perspective from the perspective of somebody who is part owner of a bank.""
Indeed Buffett, who endorsed Obama during the campaign, did explicitly say during a three-hour interview March 9 with CNBC that he still supports Obama.
""I voted for Obama and I strongly support him, and I think he's the right guy,"" Buffett said early in the interview.
Buffett did criticize Obama's handling of the banking crisis, saying that ""a bank that's going to go broke should be allowed to go broke,"" as long as the depositors are protected. (Obama's approach has leaned toward giving the banks more bailout money in some form rather than letting them fail and having the government take them over.)
But Buffett's primary concern was that Obama wasn't communicating clearly with the public about struggling banks. ""The right answer for me (to the banking crisis) is the president to clarify things as only he can, because you have heard so many different things,"" he said. ""He is the commander in chief on this, and it has to be clarified ... because if people aren't clear, they're going to be confused. And if they're going to be confused, they are going to be scared stiff. And that has to end.""
It's not surprising Buffett would want Obama to focus on the financial crisis — it has cost Buffett $25 billion. That's how much of his $62 billion fortune he lost in the past year, as shares of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway fell nearly 50 percent,
Forbes
reports. That knocked Buffett off his perch as the world's richest man, to No. 2 behind Bill Gates.
Toward the end of the three-hour interview, Buffett reiterated his support for Obama. ""He is the right president,"" Buffett said. ""He's very, very smart. He's got, I think, exactly the right goals. He's articulate and I — you know, he will be the right person to be the commander in chief in this economic crisis.""
So clearly Obama was on solid ground touting Buffett's continued support.",1,Barack Obama
"The radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners is ""equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."" New airport security measures are coming under fire from pilots and passengers, who fear the latest post-9/11 protocols are too invasive and potentially harmful.
You've probably seen the stories. The Transportation Security Administration's new full-body scanners, which are in use at 68 airports nationwide, transfer a potentially harmful amount of radiation and produce what amounts to a naked image, critics say. And the alternative to the scan, an embarrassing pat down, may be even worse.
Pilots' unions oppose the measures, as do an increasing number of passengers -- who feel the federal government has taken things too far.
PolitiFact can't weigh in on that. But we can explore the safety concerns about the full-body scan.
Particularly, we found worth analyzing the defense mounted by John Pistole, head of the TSA. During a Nov. 16, 2010, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Pistole said the ""radiation coming from those machines are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."" The TSA, on its website , says the radiation emitted from the body scan is equivalent to just two minutes of a plane flight.
Are those claims credible?
Yes. Though there is some disagreement.
Let us explain. In preparing to deploy the scanners to airports across the country, the TSA studied the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to per scan to determine if the machines were safe. Scientists at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory found that the effective dose per screening was 1.58 microrems of radiation , while a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said an adult would be exposed to 2.4 microrems of radiation per scan .
We understand those figures mean nothing to most people. So let's put it into perspective.
A single chest X-ray exposes a person to between 8,000 and 10,000 microrems (or 8 to 10 millirems), according to experts at Princeton University and the Department of Energy. A pack-a-day smoker exposes himself to 15,000 to 20,000 microrems of radiation a year (tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive lead and polonium). Put simply, it would take at least 3,300 body scans to reach the equivalent of one chest X-ray.
What's also important to note -- and a bit scary -- is that you're being exposed to radiation right now. Radiation is naturally occurring in our environment no matter where you are. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that each year, the average adult is exposed to 300 millirems of naturally occurring radiation (300,000 microrems) and 60 millirems (60,000 microrems) of man-made radiation. Pistole, in his claim, is talking about naturally occurring cosmic radiation you're exposed to during airplane travel.
The amount of cosmic radiation a person is exposed to varies based on a number of factors, but to oversimplify, a key component is how high you are above sea level. People living in Denver, which is 1 mile above sea level, are exposed to more cosmic radiation than someone living in Florida. And people flying 30,000 feet in the air are exposed to more radiation than people on the ground.
The amount of radiation varies depending upon the specific flight plan, but the Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all say that a person on a six- to eight-hour flight will be exposed to somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 microrems of radiation. For our analysis, however, we are relying on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which calculates the radiation exposure per hour based on the altitude of the flight.
According to NOAA, a person flying at 30,000 feet will be exposed to between 285 and 406 microrems of radiation an hour, or between 4.75 and 6.77 microrems per minute of flight.
All the numbers and science back up Pistole's claim -- as little as three minutes of air travel produces the equivalent amount of radiation as one TSA body scan. By most estimates, Pistole's claim actually is conservative.
However, all scientists aren't sold on the comparison. Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners. We think it's important for you hear their side, too.
Four faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco, authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices. Primarily, the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue, and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body. That concentration of radiation to the skin could be ""dangerously high,"" wrote the faculty members -- John Sedat, Marc Shuman, Robert Stroud and David Agard, who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading.
The FDA, in a detailed response , said the concerns were unfounded, and health risks associated with the full body scanners were ""minuscule.""
To be clear, this fact check isn't declaring TSA's new full-body scanners safe. We're simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole, who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners ""are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."" It may sound strange, but it's right.",1,John Pistole
"""All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange."" It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: ""Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services.""
Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why.
But one of the claims is actually true: ""All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.""
To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat.
People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate  insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service.
""This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform.
Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site.
The exchange is meant to ensure that people are ""actually getting coverage and not a junk policy,"" Tolbert added.
We should note that the e-mail says this rule is listed on page 72 of the health care bill. We found that the requirement that insurance companies must conform is also presented much earlier in the bill. We spotted an earlier reference on page 15, Section 101.
That doesn't change the fact that the assertion is correct. We've ruled that many of the e-mail's other claims are wrong, but not this one. The e-mail said, ""All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange."" We rule that True.",1,Chain email
"""Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay."" In an interview with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory zeroed in on the issue at the heart of the union showdown.
""What's so wrong with...collective bargaining?"" Gregory asked.
Walker began with a comparison to federal employees.
""Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today,"" Walker said. ""Under Barack Obama, he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has.""
Whether Walker's proposal is less restrictive than what the federal government has today is a matter of opinion (and we'll explain why later), but we were curious whether Walker's was correct that most of the roughly 2.8 million federal workers do not have collective bargaining rights to negotiate pay and health or pension benefits.
We turned first to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) which represents 600,000 federal government workers in 65 agencies, including the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is the largest federal employee union.
It's true, said Beth Moten, legislative and political director for AFGE, that most federal employees don't have collective bargaining rights over pay and benefits.
""So what's the point?"" Moten asked. ""Should employees in Wisconsin be treated as badly as federal employees are?""
There are some exceptions to this rule. Air traffic controllers, for example, can bargain over wages under a 1996 law that granted full bargaining rights to a number of federal workers covered under the Federal Aviation Administration, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor expert at Cornell University.
Some also point to the U.S. Postal Service , which has nearly 600,000 career employees, most (but not all) of whom have collective bargaining rights for pay and benefits. But theirs is a somewhat different situation. Although the U.S. Postal Service reports to Congress, it is an independent agency of the United States government. Unlike the private sector, explained U.S. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, postal employees cannot strike, nor can management lock them out.
Walker said ""most"" federal employees. And by that measure, he is correct, Bronfenbrenner said.
""Unlike all the other state, county and municipal workers in the country who have collective bargaining rights, federal workers have their pay and benefits set by Congress,"" Brofenbrenner said. ""But federal workers can bargain over terms and conditions of employment besides pay and benefits.
""This has not created stable labor relations in the public sector by any means,"" she said. ""Instead it has meant that senators and congressional representatives with large numbers of federal employees in their districts end up fighting to have money put into bills for federal workers in their districts the same as if they were lobbying to get money for a large federal contract. Thus, instead of being done in the very open transparent process of state and local public sector bargaining it is all done at a higher level, mostly behind closed doors, but the money still is getting there, just not as equitably as it would if there were collective bargaining.""
Moten, of the American Federation of Government Employees, also stressed that federal employees do have collective bargaining rights over working conditions. And that's an important right. It affects vacation time, work hours, safety issues -- all sorts of things important to workers.
Under Gov. Walker's plan, collective bargaining for state workers would be limited to base pay rate (and raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation).
In a fact-check our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin did regarding limiting labor negotiations to only wages, they quoted Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, who said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals.
""We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions,"" she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department.
Said Owley: ""We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable.""
Bottom line, negotiations over working conditions are important, and so Walker's larger point -- that he is asking for  ""something less restrictive than what the federal government has"" -- is debatable. But in saying that most federal workers don't have collective bargaining rights to benefits and pay, though, Walker is accurate. Although there are some federal workers who have collective bargaining rights for benefits and pay, ""most"" do not.",1,Scott Walker
"""The deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office."" In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is. And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor, George W. Bush.
""For the last decade, we’ve spent more money than we take in,"" Obama said. ""In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus. But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation’s credit card.
""As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.""
We've dealt with the ""what-Obama-inherited"" question before. Obama's suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bush's tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program -- rather than the recession -- is certainly debatable. But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama, we decided to check his claim that ""the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.""
In January, 2009, just prior to Obama being sworn in as president, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year (which straddled both Bush's and Obama's terms).
According to the CBO report , ""The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget. CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total $1.2 trillion, or 8.3 percent of GDP.""
The CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be ""dramatically worse"" in 2009 than 2008.
According to the CBO, ""A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending (much of it related to the government’s actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets) both contribute to the robust growth in this year’s deficit. Compared with receipts last year, collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent; in normal economic conditions, they would both grow by several percentage points. In addition, the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than $180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP.""
In addition, the CBO noted, as a result of the recession, the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance.
Again, this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office. The CBO acknowledged it might get worse.
""That total ($1.2 trillion deficit), however, does not include the effects of any future legislation,"" the CBO noted. ""Enactment of an economic stimulus package, for example, would add to the 2009 deficit.""
As we know, of course, the Democrat-controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package. And, in fact, due in large part to the stimulus, the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about $200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009.
An April study from the Pew Charitable Trust  found that a combination of factors -- increased government spending, tax cuts and the economic downturn -- were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits.
But Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the center for Economic Policy Research, argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27, 2011, that it's really the recession, and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency, that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections. If the unemployment rate returned to the 4.7 percent rate of 2007, he wrote, the bulk of the deficit would disappear.
To lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading, Baker wrote.
""In its budget projections from January 2008, the last set before the impact of the collapse of the housing bubble was clear, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a deficit of just $198 billion for 2009,"" Baker wrote. ""This is less than one-fifth of the 'on track to top $1 trillion' figure that President Obama gave in his speech. This is a serious error.
Rather, Baker wrote, ""It was the recession, and the response to it, that pushed the deficit in 2009 from the $198 billion projected by CBO to the over $1 trillion noted by President Obama in his speech.""
""No one can justify wasting money on wars that should not have been fought, giving away tax breaks to people who don't need them, or deliberately designing a prescription drug benefit so that it needlessly hands hundreds of billions of dollars to drug companies and insurers,"" Baker wrote. ""But even with all of this waste, the deficit was still not out of control.""
We're not going to wade into the debate over how much of the deficit to assign to Bush or Obama's policies. Obama may be laying too much blame for the deficit crisis on Bush policies, and not enough on the recession. But the economic downturn was in full bloom when Obama took office and he is correct that before he enacted any policies as president, the CBO projected a 2009 deficit of $1.2 trillion (as well as significant projected deficits in years to come as well).",1,Barack Obama
"Members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill ""when the stimulus was rushed into law."" During his last Saturday radio address before the Nov. 2, 2010, elections, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio -- the likely speaker of the House if the Republicans take over  -- made a closing argument for his party that included a call for greater congressional transparency.
""There’s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that’s change Congress itself,"" Boehner said. ""The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them – something they didn’t get when the ‘stimulus’ was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called ‘comprehensive’ bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view – not written in the Speaker’s office, behind closed doors.""
We wanted to see whether Boehner was right that lawmakers or the public didn't get three days to pore over the stimulus prior to passage.
The bill in question is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or H.R. 1. We should first point out that the bill went through more than one iteration, and Boehner didn't specify which one he meant. The bill was first passed by the House, then passed by the Senate with amendments, then went to a joint House-Senate conference committee to iron out differences. Then the final bill was passed in turn by the House and the Senate before going to President Barack Obama for his signature.
According to THOMAS, the official legislative-tracking website of the Library of Congress, the bill was officially introduced in the House on Jan. 26, 2009 -- just six days after Obama was sworn in. By 6:11 pm on Jan. 28, after various procedural hurdles were cleared, the House approved this initial version. While THOMAS doesn't specify the exact hour the bill was introduced, the records indicate the vote took place less than three days after the bill was introduced.
At this point, the bill went to the Senate. It was officially transmitted to the Senate on Jan. 29, and on Feb. 2, the Senate officially took up its own version along with a slew of amendments, and they were under consideration from Feb. 2 until Feb. 7. However, as this was going on, a bipartisan group of moderate senators, led by Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., was trying to craft a scaled-down version of the bill that could win the support of the required 60 Senators.
They succeeded, and on Feb. 7, the new Senate version was introduced. After moving through a series of steps, the Senate passed the measure at 12:27 p.m. on Feb. 10. So for the Senate version, the chamber and the public did have roughly three days to consider the bill, which was very similar to the initial version.
Because the versions passed in each chamber were different, leaders in the two chambers quickly established a conference committee -- a panel of House and Senate members charged with hammering out a compromise. This conference committee officially filed its new bill at 10:25 p.m. on Feb. 12.
It was less than 24 hours before the House acted on the conference report, passing it at 2:24 p.m. on Feb. 13. The Senate quickly followed suit, passing the measure at 5:29 p.m. the same day. Four days later, on Feb. 17, the president signed it.
To summarize: The first version clearly passed the House less than three days after it was introduced, while the centrist compromise version passed the  Senate roughly three days after it was formally introduced. Meanwhile, both chambers passed the conference report -- the final version that became law -- within 24 hours of the bill's filing. So in all except cases except the main Senate vote, it's clear Boehner is correct. And in the case of the Senate version, he's cutting it close because it was right at three days.",1,John Boehner
"Says McCain once said that on ""the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush."" It didn't take long for Sen. Joe Biden to adopt the Obama campaign talking points linking Sen. John McCain to President Bush.
At a rally in Springfield, Ill. celebrating Biden's selection as Sen. Barack Obama's running mate, the Delaware senator offered polite praise of McCain — ""He served our country with extraordinary courage and I know he wants to do right by America"" — but then criticized McCain for embracing Bush's policies.
""And these are John's words, (on) 'the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush.' Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said,"" Biden told the crowd.
The quote comes from a June 19, 2005, McCain appearance on NBC's
Meet the Press
in which  host Tim Russert asked the senator about an article in the
Arizona Republic
that explored how McCain differed from Bush on many issues.
""The fact is,"" Russert said, ""you are different than George Bush.""
""No. No,"" McCain replied. ""The fact is that I'm different, but the fact is that I have agreed with President Bush far more than I have disagreed. And on the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush.""
McCain continued, ""So have we had some disagreements on some issues, the bulk — particularly domestic issues? Yes. But I will argue my conservative record voting with anyone's, and I will also submit that my support for President Bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the American people. And I'm particularly talking about the war on terror, the war in Iraq, national security, national defense, support of men and women in the military, fiscal discipline, a number of other issues. So I strongly disagree with any assertion that I've been more at odds with the president of the United States than I have been in agreement with him.""
The interview makes interesting reading today because several of Russert's questions are based on comments from another senator who had just returned from Iraq in June 2005 — Biden. And the interview actually focuses more on McCain's differences with Bush (on issues such as global warming, judicial nominees and stem cell research) than it does on topics they agree about.
But Biden is right that McCain said it.",1,Joe Biden
"""Almost half a million people are still eligible (for DACA), particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community."" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has presented herself as an advocate for immigrants, saying she’ll push for immigration reform within her first 100 days in the Oval Office and promising to continue the deferred deportation plans of President Barack Obama.
On Aug. 15 — four years to the day since immigration officials began accepting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications — she published a post on Medium directed to those who have applied for the deportation relief program and to those who haven’t.
""In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential  —  that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill,"" Clinton wrote.
She said a sizable amount of immigrants could still apply for the program.
""Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community,"" Clinton wrote.
We wondered if Clinton was right about the estimated number of eligible applicants, and whether the Asian and Pacific Islander communities represented an outsized proportion.
Clinton’s campaign directed us to an August report published by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analyzing DACA application rates. The study found that application rates were ""generally very low"" for immigrants born in Asia.
DACA background
The Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration enforcement, announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, in June 2012.
It was designed to defer deportation for undocumented immigrants 30 years old or younger and who arrived in the United States before they were 16 years old. Applicants have to meet several criteria to be considered, including having continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007, and be in school, have graduated or obtained a GED certificate, or be an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or U.S. armed forces. Applicants also cannot have felony convictions, a significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors, nor can they be be a threat to national security or public safety.
Advocates argue that those who were brought to the country by their parents as children should be given opportunities to stay in the country since they likely weren’t the ones making decisions to migrate or to stay in the country illegally.
DACA does not grant lawful status, but people who receive DACA are not considered to be ""unlawfully present"" during their time of deferred action. DACA defers deportation for two-year periods, it can be renewed and beneficiaries can also apply for work permits.
This summer, the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 decision on an extended version of DACA and on a deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, which allowed an appellate court’s injunction to stand. That decision does not affect the original DACA.
DACA eligible population
Back to Clinton’s point: We wondered how many unauthorized immigrants are eligible and how many have applied.
When it comes to the undocumented population, what’s usually available are just estimates. The Migration Policy Institute report is based on a formula using federal immigration data and Census Bureau survey data.
The report offers two sets of eligible applicants: 1.3 million and 1.7 million.
The institute found that about 1.3 million unauthorized immigrants were immediately eligible for DACA in 2016  — they met all criteria, including high school completion or school enrollment.
About 400,000 more met DACA criteria except high school completion or school enrollment requirement in 2014.
The additional 400,000 may have become eligible for DACA by enrolling in an adult education program — bringing the total eligible population in 2016 to about 1.7 million, the institute said.
As of March 31 , 2016, immigration officials had accepted about 820,000 (meaning they can begin going through the deferred-action process). Of the nearly 820,000 accepted, officials approved 728,285.
So of the 1.3 million immediately eligible population, about 480,000 can still apply.
By assuming up to 1.7 million are eligible, then there could be up to 880,000 who can still apply for DACA.
Clinton is right that immigrants from the Asian and Pacific Islander population comprise a large chunk of people who can still apply.
South Korea ranked fourth among the top five countries of birth for the immediately eligible DACA population in 2016 (after Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador), according to the institute. Honduras was fifth.
But only 7,000 of the estimated 49,000 eligible South Koreans have applied. And less than 30 percent of about 33,000 eligible immigrants from India and the Philippines have applied.
Multiple immigration scholars and experts we reached out to cited MPI’s research as a credible base for DACA estimates.
There are more than 130,000 undocumented immigrants of Asian descent eligible for DACA, according to estimates cited by the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group also noted back in 2014 that DACA enrollment from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was ""disproportionately low.""
Mexican-born immigrants represented 63 percent of the immediately eligible DACA population and 78 percent of them have applied, according to MPI.
New America Media, a national collaboration of 3,000 ethnic news organizations, reported earlier this month that applications from Asians and Pacific Islanders may be at lower rates because those communities may not know they can apply.
Some of the reasons they have not applied may include fear of immigration agencies, cultural stigma in speaking about immigration status, shortage of community resources about DACA in languages spoken by Asians and Pacific Islanders, and few portrayals of deportation relief as an issue for their communities, said Sheridan Lagunas, a spokesperson for United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant rights national group.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a $34 million payout when he left the company to join the presidential ticket. The oil-services and infrastructure giant Halliburton is a favorite target for critics of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who used to be the company's CEO. During the presidency of George W. Bush, the company's Iraq War-related contracts attracted wide attention. Now, the company's role in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought Halliburton back into the headlines.
During a May 20, 2010, appearance with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews revived the Cheney-Halliburton connection while discussing the spill.
At one point in the interview, Leno said, ""All right, a lot going on in politics with this BP thing. This is the one-month anniversary. Where are we? Who’s the lying scum here?""
Matthews responded, ""Yeah, it’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen, and, you know, I don’t know where to start. I mean, Halliburton. Sound familiar? Cheney. Cheney was head of Halliburton. When he got to be vice president, when he was signed for vice president, the oil company gave him a $34 million signing bonus to become vice president of the United States.""
We'll grant Matthews some artistic license with his comment. We know he doesn't mean that Cheney literally got a signing bonus for becoming the vice presidential candidate, as a newly signed free agent would in baseball. But we thought it was worth checking whether Cheney did in fact end up with a $34 million payout when he stepped down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000.
We looked at a personal financial disclosure form that Cheney signed on Sept. 1, 2000. This is the filing made once someone joins a national presidential ticket. It represents the candidate's holdings and income as of August. In the portion addressing Cheney's compensation from Halliburtion, the file lists the following categories and dollar amounts as of that date:
• Salary/bonus (gross): $4,721, 947
• Deferred salary: $1,042, 441
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $654,804
Meanwhile, on May 15, 2001, Cheney also signed a second disclosure form that is supposed to update the August 2000 filing so that it covers the full year. In this filing, Cheney disclosed the following Halliburton income:
• Salary/bonus (gross): $821,896
• Elective deferred salary: $403,166
• Stock equivalent unit bonus: $396,213
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $53,692
• Elective deferred salary lump sum payout: $1,140,160
• Restricted stock imputed income: $7,560,000
• Nonqualified stock option income: $21,964,254
• Senior executive deferred compensation payout: $2,797,128
However, we were unclear about whether the totals from the May 2001 filing, which amount to $35.1 million, should be added to those from the August 2000 filing, which amount to $6.4 million, or whether the amounts in the two filings overlap somewhat. Experts we spoke to expressed uncertainty on this question as well. So we decided to take the most cautious approach and only use the numbers from the second filing, which covers the whole year.
That still leaves a total of $35.1 million earned from Halliburtion reported on the May 2001 filing. Of that total, just over $800,000 represents salary and bonus, which Cheney would have earned regardless of whether he joined the ticket or not. Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation, as would happen in the case of any CEO who left a position early, so it seems fair to call the rest of the income he received an exit package.
So, if you subtract the salary and bonus from the larger amount, voila -- you get $34 million and change. So Matthews is right.
A footnote: Cheney's timing was impeccable. As the disclosure forms indicate, he held a large number of stock options, which means he had been given the right to purchase shares of the company for an old (and, hopefully for the holder of the options) lower price than the current market value. When the holder chooses to exercise those options, they can buy the shares at the low price and then sell them at the market price, pocketing the difference.
It's not clear when Cheney sold his stock options, but it likely was within weeks of his being named to the ticket -- a period when Halliburtion shares hit their 2000 peak, in the low-to-mid $50 range. By November 30, 2000, the stock had fallen to $33 a share. If he'd waited until then to sell, his payday would have been one-third lower, or roughly $14 million rather than $22 million.",1,Chris Matthews
"John McCain wants to ""give oil companies another $4-billion"" in tax breaks. During the presidential debate, John McCain and Barack Obama sparred over taxes.
McCain discussed his support for a reduction in corporate tax rates, which he said would help create jobs. A few moments later, he criticized Obama for voting for the 2005 energy bill, which McCain said was full of unnecessary spending.
""It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments,"" McCain said. ""It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Sen. Obama voted for it.""
""John, you want to give oil companies another $4-billion,"" Obama retorted.
We've checked the controversy over Obama's energy vote previously . We found the bill, which did become law, included both incentives for clean energy and tax breaks for oil companies. Obama has said he felt the good in the bill outweighed the bad.
Here, we'll look at Obama's claim that McCain wants to give oil companies $4-billion in tax breaks, a claim he's made several times.
The Obama campaign defends this claim because McCain supports cutting corporate taxes, reducing them from a maximum rate of 35 percent to a maximum rate of 25 percent.
Based on that tax change, the Obama campaign estimates that oil companies would save $4-billion a year. Specifically, they cite a study from the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund. That group analyzed financial statements from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the five largest oil companies and calculated current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. They then calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8-billion; $1.2-billion Exxon Mobil alone.
In our previous look at this $4-billion claim, Obama didn't mention McCain's position on cutting corporate taxes for all companies. We concluded that Obama was cherry-picking by singling out oil companies. That led us to rule his statement Barley True.
But at the debate, the two candidates had just discussed McCain's position on corporate taxes and were talking about how overarching policy could affect tax breaks for oil companies. The context of the exchange explained McCain's overall policy on corporate taxes. As a result, when Obama made the claim in the debate, it was True.",1,Barack Obama
"""Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes."" Forget the Senate’s ""nuclear option."" Congress’s latest point of tension is the nuclear deal with Iran.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those opposed to the six-month deal, in which the United States agreed to lessen sanctions on Iran in exchange for certain limits placed on Iran’s growing nuclear program. The deal was brokered by the P5+1, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany.
In his press release , Rubio highlighted a notoriously rocky relationship between the two countries, calling Iran a ""rogue state."" He went on to criticize the country’s leadership.
""Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes,"" he said.
We wanted to see if Rubio’s claim was right and what evidence it was based on.
Khamenei’s role
We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s office, but we found that Khamenei gave a speech on Nov. 20, prior to the public announcement of the agreement.
Khamenei is Iran’s appointed supreme leader and the country’s head of state. He holds more power in Iran than even President Hassan Rouhani, who is widely considered a moderate. Many analysts credit Rouhani’s election with making the recent agreement possible.
As we’ll see, Khamenei’s takes a more hard-line approach toward both the United States and Israel than Rouhani.
Khamenei is in charge of all of Iran’s foreign policy, including the nuclear agreement. But it’s worth noting that since he’s so high-ranking, he won’t be heavily involved in day-to-day operations -- that’s left to nuclear physicists and other lower-ranking officials.
""Rabid dog""
U.S. and Iranian news outlets reported that Khamenei said something about a ""rabid dog"" in a speech Nov. 20, less than a week before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal with Iran.
We saw conflicting reports in the direct translation of the phrase from Farsi to English. It wasn’t immediately clear to us whether Khamenei directed the comment toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all Israeli people or all Jewish people.
PolitiFact asked two Farsi-speaking Iranian political science experts for independent translations of the line in question. We showed the experts the Farsi speech transcript published on Khamenei’s official website. We also consulted an English-language video translation from Press TV, a state-owned news outlet in Iran.
We found small discrepancies in the exact translation:
""Israel is the rabid dog of the region,"" was the wording Syracuse University Iranian studies professor Mehrzad Boroujerdi put forward, which closely matches many news reports we’ve seen.
""These Zionist financiers are really like wild beasts,"" was the wording Middle East Institute scholar Alex Vatanka gave us. He told us ""wild beasts"" and ""rabid dogs"" were not so far off from each other in Farsi. ""Zionist financiers,"" he said, is a clear reference to the Israeli government, especially Netanyahu.
""Israeli officials cannot be called humans. They are like animals, some of them."" That’s from the Press TV translator.
Exact wording aside, the sentiment is largely the same. Khamenei did in fact call either government officials or the country as a whole the animals of the Middle East.
That’s consistent with Khamenei’s overall stance, Vatanka said, adding that the leader previously referred to Israel as a "" cancerous tumor "" on the region. But Khamenei’s comments don’t necessarily reflect the way other Iranian officials or the public feels about Israel, Vatanka added.
""War crimes""
Rubio also said that Khamenei recently accused the United States of carrying out war crimes. When we watched the speech, we found truth to that .
""They committed crimes in Iraq, in Pakistan with drones. Still they are committing crimes with drones,"" he said, according to the Press TV translation. ""In Afghanistan they bombard people and they continue to commit crimes. Anywhere in which they can serve their interests, they will commit crimes including torture, killings, the Guantanamo prison.""
That’s not an unusual statement for Khamenei.
""The man’s position on the United States has always been that the United States is unjust in its policies, it’s arrogant in its policies and it’s not trustworthy,"" Vatanka said. But at the same time, Khamenei has always supported reaching out to the United States when he feels the timing is right, Vatanka added.
""(Iranian officials) would not have been sitting in Geneva negotiating with Kerry if they didn’t have the green light from Khamenei.""",1,Marco Rubio
"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ""said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' "" Trying to portray her running mate as a maverick still capable of shaking up the political establishment, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to reference Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's public distaste of John McCain, and get a retaliatory dig in at the sharp-tongued Nevada Democrat.
""Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee,"" Palin said Sept. 3, 2008. ""He said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man.""
Reid did, indeed, express exactly those sentiments in an Aug. 21 interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
Asked about Connecticut Independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's decision to accept a prime-time speaking slot at the Republican convention, Reid defended the former Democratic vice presidential nominee and related a conversation the two men had after Lieberman informed him of his decision. Lieberman continues to vote with Senate Democrats on procedural matters, and chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the Democratic-controlled chamber.
""He (Lieberman) has a close personal relationship with John McCain. I don't fully understand why he does,"" Reid told the newspaper. ""I told him last night, 'You know, Joe, I can't stand John McCain.' He said, 'I know you feel that way.' ''
It's not the first time Reid has leveled a harsh personal critique at his colleague. In May, Reid appeared in a video posted on the Web site BigThink.com in which he contrasted McCain with then-Democratic primary rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton and called the Arizonan a flawed candidate, in part, because his temper prevents him from getting along with colleagues.
Reid went on to dismiss McCain's record of bipartisanship as something of a myth.
""I think that this illusion that's out there that he's a great bipartisan person is really without much foundation,"" Reid stated. ""He worked with Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform, that's nice, he's reached across the aisle in a couple of occasions, but there have been a couple of occasions … he supports the president in all of his crazy economic policies, he has supported the president on this war, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, so I can't get much of my juices flowing for John McCain. There are a lot of them flowing to do everything I can to make sure that he's not president.""
The personal criticism is a bit puzzling, if only because McCain and Reid have had few public run-ins. McCain has been out campaigning, and absent from the Senate chamber, for most of the time Reid has served as majority leader. And during the six years Reid served as Senate Democrats' second-in-command as whip, he supported McCain's biggest legislative accomplishment: the 2002 rewrite of the nation's campaign finance laws that McCain shepherded with Russ Feingold, D-Wis., which Reid referenced in his video clip.
But the lawmakers from neighboring states have had decades to get to know each other, and presumably build up personal animosities. They both arrived in Washington as newly elected congressmen in 1982, and both moved to the Senate in 1986. There, they've displayed distinctly different personalities. The high-energy McCain is blunt, funny and testy — and has irritated colleagues in the clubby chamber by being quick to discard customary courtesies. Reid, in contrast, is an effective behind-the-scenes operator who comes off as taciturn and dour, and who shuns the kind of self-promotion that consumes many of his colleagues. Their common trait is boxing: Reid was a former amateur fighter, while McCain spent time in the ring as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy.
Reid's assessment of McCain's bipartisanship in the video is harsh, even by most Democratic critics' standards. It was McCain who worked with liberal icon Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2006 on an immigration overhaul that most Democrats backed to create a guest worker program and give longtime illegal aliens a chance to become citizens. In 2005, he helped broker a deal among a bipartisan group of senators to prevent a showdown over Democrats' ability to filibuster conservative judicial nominees. And he defied his party by opposing President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 (he now supports making them permanent) and pushing for stricter fuel efficiency standards and caps on greenhouse gases to combat global warming.
But at least Reid can't be accused of sugarcoating his personal impressions. He's on the record as not being able to stand John McCain. And because Palin correctly cites his recent remarks, we judge her statement True.",1,Sarah Palin
"""When (John) Brennan ... was asked directly … ‘Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?’ Brennan responded and said, ‘no, there is no limitation.’"" When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6, 2013, he said he just wanted answers.
He wanted President Barack Obama’s administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil. During his epic stand on the Senate floor, which only ended with the inevitable call of nature, Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him -- including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan.
""When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, 'Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?' Brennan responded and said, 'no, there is no limitation,'"" Paul said during the first hour of filibustering.
Paul's issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States. After his filibuster, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Paul's concerns in a letter. Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority ""to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil.""
In looking over Paul's statements during the filibuster, we wondered: Did Paul accurately characterize Brennan’s answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was ""no geographic limitation?""
We reached out to Paul’s office but did not hear back. Still, we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue. In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Brennan -- acknowledging the administration’s drone program for the first time publicly -- said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield. At the time he was Obama’s point person on counterterrorism strategy.
""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat,"" he said.
In February 2013, ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director, Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions.
Question: ""Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not?"" Brennan replied : ""On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields, I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al-Qaida and associated forces. As Jeh Johnson, the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense, indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation. Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary.""
And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing, Brennan was again asked about ""geographical limits"" on the administration’s drone strikes. He noted , in part, ""the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’""
But he went on to say: ""This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.""
We ran this issue by Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University. He responded: ""Sen. Paul's comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennan's answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administration's authority to conduct strikes. Brennan's further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world, but those considerations do not constitute a ‘geographic limitation.’""",1,Rand Paul
"Says Barack Obama is ""trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks."" The National Rifle Association is out with a Top 10-style list detailing why President Barack Obama is anti-gun. We’re investigating several of the claims on the list. You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week.
Today, we tackle the No. 6 reason why President Barack Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment: ""Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""
(For the record, the NRA list doesn’t rank one reason as being worse than another, so the fact that this claim is No. 6 doesn’t mean it's more serious than, say, No. 10, ""Obama admits he's coming for our guns ..."")
The ""Armed Pilots Program"" is officially called the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It’s pretty much what it sounds like.
The federal government has budgeted $25 million a year to deputize and train volunteer commercial pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights. The federal government has not said how many pilots take part.
In the FY 2013 budget, Obama proposed to cut the program’s funding roughly in half, to $12 million.
Here’s how the administration explained the cut in its budget request:
""The Administration proposes to reduce funding for the FFDO program (i.e., deputized, armed pilots) in 2013. As the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses its aviation security activities on programs that mitigate the highest amount of risk at the lowest cost, the Budget has prioritized funding in the same manner. The voluntary FFDO program was created as a ‘last defense’ layer of security at a time when comprehensive aviation screening and other physical security measures were not fully developed or deployed on a system-wide basis. Since 2001, however, there have been a number of enhancements to aviation security. TSA now conducts 100 percent screening of all passengers and their carryon items, has overseen installation of reinforced and locking cockpit doors on aircraft that operate in U.S. airspace, and has increased passenger and flight crew awareness to address security risks. Combined, these improvements have greatly lowered the chances of unauthorized cockpit access and represent a comprehensive and redundant risk-mitigation strategy that begins well before passengers board the aircraft.""
In short, the Obama administration said that arming pilots isn’t as important as it use to be, given other security improvements.
Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole also said that the agency has had trouble coordinating schedules of armed pilots, whose flights are set by the airlines, with those of U.S. air marshals managed by the TSA, according to Bloomberg . ""In an ideal world, one without budget constraints, we would fully fund the program. We’re not in that environment, so we are taking reductions,"" he said.
The Republican-led House disagreed.
On June 6, 2012, the House voted not only to reverse Obama’s proposed cuts but to increase the program’s budget to $35 million.
""9/11 woke us up to the reality that we live in a dangerous world. With varied and ever-emerging threats, every effort should be made to make air travel as safe as possible,"" said Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., who sponsored the amendment. (Cravaack is a former Northwest Airlines pilot who says he was in the Armed Pilots Program.)
Lastly we checked with Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been following the issue. Darling noted that the Armed Pilots Program had been funded at the same level since its inception, and that Obama’s decision to cut the program in half seems more like a policy choice than something prompted by budget constraints.
Still, the savings are relatively small. The $12 million-$13 million in potential savings comprises about 0.15 percent of the entire TSA $7.6 billion proposed budget. Our ruling
The NRA claimed that Obama is ""trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""
The Armed Pilots Program was created post-Sept. 11, 2001, to serve as a last-line of defense in a terror attack. And Obama, in his FY 2013 budget proposal, did propose cutting the budget for the program in half.
Obama says the program isn’t as critical as it once was. But that doesn’t contradict the NRA’s claim.",1,National Rifle Association
"""Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter."" A criminal complaint against a suspect who the FBI said plotted a Christmas Day massacre in San Francisco focused on his expressions in support of ISIS and terrorism.
The conspiracy-minded website Infowars said news reports omitted some of the true political affiliations of suspect Everitt Aaron Jameson, describing him as part of the anti-Trump, radical left crowd.
""Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter,"" stated the Dec. 23 headline .
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news.
The Infowars article zeroed in on Facebook pages ""liked"" by Jameson to portray him as a far-left user who ""liked"" anti-Trump and Antifa groups as well as news organizations such as CNN and BuzzFeed and pro-vegan groups.
""Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism,"" stated Infowars.
We found Jameson did show some interest in anti-Trump and Antifa groups (Antifa is a shorthand term for anti-fascists.). But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the government’s complaint.
FBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson
Here is what happened ahead of the planned incident, according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec. 22:
In September, a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jameson’s Facebook account showed he ""liked"" or ""loved"" pro-ISIS and terrorism posts, such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite.
Jameson, a recent convert to Islam, had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism, including the Oct. 31, 2017, terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people.
""I’m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back,"" Jameson wrote on Facebook.
In December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson, who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS. Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack.
Jameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area. He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition, assault rifle and materials to make explosives.
A couple of days later, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employee’s phone number which had a 202 (Washington, D.C.) area code. Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack.
On Dec. 20, law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jameson’s home. The letter included one mention of Trump -- a reference to Trump’s recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: ""You’ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews.""
Two days later, federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson, a 26-year-old Modesto truck driver, with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Jameson faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Jameson’s family said he was depressed over losing custody of his children and insisted he never talked about violence or being influenced by terrorist groups.
Jameson’s federal public defender Heather E. Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered.
""In my understanding, the label ‘antifa’ means ‘anti-fascist.’  If being anti-Trump, anti-fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be a ‘terrorist’ than not, the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people,"" she told PolitiFact.
Jameson’s Facebook page
The 11-page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the U.S. Attorney make no mention of Antifa, and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jameson’s home. Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa.
Antifa broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
Infowars drew from an archived version of Jameson’s Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups -- three in California and one in Portland. He also liked a few anti-Trump groups, such as the ""Trump resistance movement."" We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political (""Sassy Socialist Memes"") to food, fashion, TV and sports.
We asked spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti-Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective, but authorities declined to answer that question.
We posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism: Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, and Erin Miller, at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland.
Levin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge, which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. ISIS is considered a foreign terrorist organization while Antifa isn’t.
""That’s why ISIS ‘likes’ would be factually and legally relevant and the others would not,"" Levin said. ""The focus of his alleged goals was aligned with ISIS and apparently less so than with the other entities which aren’t designated as foreign terrorist organizations.""
His main interest is clearly ISIS and to suggest otherwise is not wholly accurate, Levin said.
""Extremists are not hermetically sealed in freeze-dried containers -- they often dine from buffet of hatred but usually there is one that predominants and that’s what we apparently have here,"" he said.
There is a broad spectrum within Antifa, which includes some individuals who have expressed violence. But an abstract embrace of Antifa isn’t illegal.
""Like the anti-abortion movement, ‘Antifa’ is itself an ideological movement,"" Miller said. ""Like any ideological movement, individuals can identify with it. Formal organizations can coalesce within/around it. Either can engage in non-violent or violent efforts to in an attempt promote the ideology/movement.""",1,  Infowars
"Says there are thousands of registered voters over 110 years old in North Carolina, including one who is 219 years old. A chain email has begun circulating in North Carolina that claims widespread irregularities in the state’s voter rolls.
The email caught our attention with its subject line, ""PROOF !! North Carolina has the world's oldest voters !""
It says there are thousands of registered voters in North Carolina who are 110 or more years old, including one person who is a whopping 219 years old.
Though tongue-in-cheek, the implication is clear – that many dead people are still actively registered, perhaps allowing others to commit voter fraud by casting ballots in their names.
""Perhaps it is something in the (North) Carolina water,"" the email begins. ""I doubt there is another state in the Union who could claim, as NC does, to have 5,376 voters 110 years old, or older. One current voter was born in 1798, making him a rather hefty 219 years old, thereby  nearly doubling the age of the oldest person on earth.""
If all this is true, it would clearly indicate some concerning irregularities.
The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the oldest living people , has been able to verify only 43 people in the entire world age 110 or older as of May 3.
The email concludes that this is ""more evidence that when you think of questionable elections, (North) Carolina should be the FIRST state that comes to mind.""
So we wanted to get to the bottom of which is fraudulent – this email, or the state’s voter rolls.
Following the president’s lead?
The chain email began making the rounds, it appears, shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new committee on May 11 to look into voter fraud around the country.
Trump has consistently spread false claims about voter fraud, both during his presidential campaign and after winning the election.
He said ""millions"" of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton and that he should’ve won the popular vote, which PolitiFact ruled Pants On Fire . In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare.
Trump has also made unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud against several individual states – all of which have been rated Pants On Fire – including North Carolina , California , New Hampshire and Virginia .
Those claims are either vague about the type of fraud or refer specifically to immigrants voting illegally. None have claimed what this new chain email alleges, that dead people are somehow voting.
In years past, versions of this claim have been popular on conservative and right-wing websites, internet forums and blogs – including Breitbart and the North Carolina-based Civitas Institute .
Why so many ancient voters?
The chain email’s most eye-popping claim is about that 219-year-old voter. It’s also the first mistake the email makes. It refers to that person as a male, but a list of voters included in the email clearly shows he is really a she.
There’s more intrigue: In 2012, when Breitbart wrote about super-old voters in North Carolina, it didn’t mention anyone over 200. We wondered if this woman only recently decided – nearly a century since being eligible to vote – that now was the time to finally register.
So we asked Pat Gannon, the spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He said the state database does appear to show 5,391 people over 110 – a few more than the email mentioned, even – but that there are several honest explanations.
For the 219-year-old, he said, it amounts to just plain human error when a clerk was entering the person’s information.
""The ‘219-year-old’ voter was inadvertently given a birth date of 1797 instead of 1979, according to our research,"" Gannon wrote in an email. ""We’ve also determined that the voters that show up as 118, 120 and 154 years old do so because of data entry errors. Their dates of birth will soon be corrected in our database.""
But that only covers four out of 5,391. What about the rest?
Nearly all of them – 97.5 percent – are what the state calls ""legacy voters.""
Until the 1990s, people who registered to vote in North Carolina didn't have to list their date of birth. They only had to promise they were at least 18.
Then, in the late 2000s, the state digitized its voter records. Gannon said anyone who was in the system with no date of birth was automatically listed as being born Jan. 1 in either 1900 or 1901. Of the 5,391 voters who appear over 110 in the database, he said, 5,257 fall into that category.
As for the other 130 questionable voters (2.4 percent of the total), Gannon said, some could still be alive, could be dead, or could be listed due to clerical errors like the four they’ve already identified.
Most North Carolina voters who die are automatically removed from voter rolls, since they die in North Carolina or another state that shares its records with North Carolina.
But Gannon said some states don’t share their records, including South Carolina and Virginia, the two states with the longest borders with North Carolina. Any North Carolina voters who die in one of those states won’t have their registrations revoked until either a family member notifies the state or eight years go by without that person voting.
And while it’s possible there are dead people on the voter rolls, people committing fraud by voting in their names is almost unheard of. In the 2016 general election, two people in North Carolina were caught voting for dead family members, out of 4.8 million voters statewide who cast a ballot, according to a previous audit by the elections board.",0,Chain email
"Pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage because they have a ""pre-existing condition."" You've probably heard of ""pre-existing conditions,"" which provide an escape clause for health insurance companies. If you have a pre-existing condition, an insurance company typically won't pay for treatment.
J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, cited them when he was asked during an appearance on
Fox News Sunday
on Aug. 16, 2009, whether the Democratic health plan would lead to rationing for older patients.
""Well, there's a myth that rationing doesn't occur right now,"" Rohack said. ""In the United States, if a woman's pregnant and on the individual market (and) tries to get health insurance, that's called a pre-existing condition and it's not paid for. That's why this bill's important. It gets rid of some of the rationing that's occurring right now."" The AMA endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July.
First, we should emphasize that he's only talking about the relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what insurers call the individual market. About two-thirds of women have health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, and about 13 percent have public coverage such as Medicaid or military health care.
So the people affected by these limitations include the 19 percent now uninsured and the 6 percent that have coverage purchased on the individual market. These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurer, and the purchaser doesn't get the same consumer protections routinely given to those who have coverage through an employer. For example, people in employer-based health plans have benefited from requirements for maternity coverage that date back to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. But individual plans are not included under that umbrella and are regulated state by state.
In 39 states, listed here , insurers can turn down anyone for virtually any reason. It can be because you have a pre-existing condition, like cancer or diabetes. And pregnancy almost always counts too, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents the state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders. So if you're pregnant and living in one of these 39 states, you're very likely out of luck in securing individual health coverage. You'll have to pay for your care out of your own pocket or seek out charitable assistance.
And the coverage isn't much better in the remaining 11 states. These states have ""guaranteed issue"" laws that say insurers cannot turn applicants down based on their health or risk status. But there's a caveat: Even if an insurer must offer you a plan, it can place exclusions on what the plan covers. Typically, the NAIC says, these exclusions last from six to 12 months, which rules out most or all maternity coverage. (After the exclusion expires, the insurer does have to cover those conditions, meaning that a subsequent pregnancy could be covered.)
One category of individual policyholders has it slightly better ? those who leave an employer's plan that had given them uninterrupted coverage for the pre-existing condition in question. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, people in this category can obtain a plan that covers their pre-existing condition once they have exhausted their old employer's coverage under the law known as COBRA. However, a state only has to provide a minimum of one ""HIPAA plan"" within its borders, rather than requiring that every insurer operating in the state offer one. Such plans may have unfavorable terms and high premiums.
So back to Rohack's claim. Health care reform legislation now under consideration in Congress would, if enacted, improve the situation for pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre-existing conditions. But for now, Rohack is correct that pregnancy is considered a pre-existing condition and prevents many women from getting coverage if they seek insurance on the individual market.",1,J. James Rohack
"U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan include a ""few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country."" Update: We originally addressed this when it was released as a web ad on Memorial Day. On July 11, the McCain campaign released the same video as a national television ad. Because it will be new to many people seeing it for the first time on television, we decided to re-post the item.
In a Web ad released on Memorial Day, Sen. John McCain praises the many Hispanic soldiers serving in the U.S. military, some of whom are not yet legal citizens of the United States.
""My friends, I want you, the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite,"" McCain begins. ""You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names.
""When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background.
""You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation.
""So let's, from time to time, remember that these are God's children. They must come into this country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them.""
We checked with the Defense Department to see how many noncitizens are serving in the U.S. military, and if McCain was accurate that there are thousands serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.
The short answer is that McCain is right.
As of Feb. 29, 2008, there were 20,328 noncitizens on active duty in the military (about 1.5 percent of the entire active military), according to a report provided by the Pentagon. Of those, 4,112 were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, or in support of those operations elsewhere. There were another 2,236 whose citizenship was ""unknown.""
These are legal residents with green cards who have not yet become naturalized citizens. There are citizenship incentives for those who enlist. All immigrants who serve honorably in the military during wartime are eligible to file for immediate citizenship under special wartime provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
An analysis of the Pentagon report by PolitiFact determined that about a quarter of the ""green card"" soldiers are originally from Spanish-speaking countries. In addition, there are 10,533 naturalized citizens serving in the military who were born in Spanish-speaking countries.
The thousands of noncitizens serving in Iraq and Afghanistan is one of the military's little-known facts. But apparently not to McCain.",1,John McCain
"""There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010."" One of the lines of defense in the current Internal Revenue Service controversy is that the agency stumbled under a heavy workload of applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status.
Steven Miller, the former acting IRS commissioner, made this point in a piece he wrote for USA Today, describing ""a sharp increase"" in applications. The day after an audit critical of the agency went public on May 14, 2013, the IRS posted on a question-and-answer page that ""the number of applications has more than doubled in recent years."" The agency connected that directly to the singling out of tea party groups, writing ""this inappropriate criterion was used as a shortcut to centralize similar cases.""
Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., took issue with that argument. At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, he spoke about myths being ""thrown around.""
""There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010,"" Griffin said.
It’s possible to check whether a flood of paperwork was a contributing factor in the IRS missteps and we can see if Griffin is on solid ground.
The IRS keeps track of its workload and according to the inspector general’s audit, IRS staff was on the lookout for tea party-type groups at least six months before we see a jump in the number of applications. In fact, the data tell us that the volume of applications had dropped a bit from the year before the screening began.
Here’s how the activity breaks down for 501(c)(4) applications, the sort of tax-exempt group where political activity is allowed:
2009:    1,751
2010:    1,735
2011:    2,265
2012:    3,357
The inspector general’s report said these figures came from the IRS Exempt Organizations office and were for the fiscal year. As a reminder, the government’s fiscal year starts in October, so FY 2010 begins on Oct. 1, 2009, and runs through the end of September 2010.
The inspector general’s report also provides a detailed timeline that tracks when the tea party screening began. On about March 1, 2010, a manager asked a staffer to tally the number of tea party-related applications. According to the report, the staffer ""used Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12 as part of the criteria for these searches.""
The earliest that there might have been a jump in applications would have been in October 2010. That is well after the IRS began its effort to give selective treatment to tea party groups.
The IRS is correct in saying that the number of applications doubled, but that happened later -- from 2011 to 2012. We contacted the IRS and nothing we learned changes the numbers or the sequence of events.
Reporters for the  Chronicle of Philanthropy and the  Washington Post  have sifted the facts, too, and reached the same conclusion: The rise in applications for 501(c)(4) status came after the IRS began treating tea party-type groups differently.",1,Tim Griffin
"Says Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday. A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign invokes James Bond to portray Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of McCain's energy initiatives.
With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhoutte and the words ""Barack Obama Is Dr. No.""
The words change to ""No To Drilling Offshore Oil"" while Obama is heard saying, ""Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today.""
The screen says, ""No To A Gas Tax Holiday"" while Obama says, ""I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea.""
""No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car"" appears on the screen while Obama says ""In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks.""
""No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy"" while Obama says ""I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent."" The ad ends with the message: ""Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security.""
The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. We were surprised to find the ad had a split personality. The drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we'll explain below. But we found McCain was Pants-on-Fire wrong with his claims about Obama's positions on innovation, the car and nuclear power.
The drilling claim refers to Obama's response after McCain suggested on June 16, 2008, that states be given authority to decide whether to permit offshore drilling. Indeed, that day Obama's campaign said he was opposed, and on June 20 the candidate reiterated his opposition during a stop in Jacksonville, Fla.
""I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts,"" Obama said in his prepared remarks for that appearance. He also said McCain was misleading voters by suggesting more drilling would lower gas prices, because it would take many years before a significant amount of oil was produced.
The ad's claim about the gas tax holiday refers to Obama's response to another McCain proposal, to eliminate the federal tax on gasoline between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Obama has repeatedly said he opposes the idea because oil companies would not pass along the savings and, even if they did, it would provide relatively little help to consumers. (We checked Obama's claim that it would save a typical motorist about 30 cents a day and found it Mostly True. )
So on these points, McCain's right. Obama is opposed to changing the rules on offshore drilling and suspending the gas tax. McCain gets a True.",1,John McCain
"""Obama Skips Out On Condemning Left-Wing Attacks On Gen. Petraeus Despite Casting Other 'Important Votes' Earlier And Later In The Day."" Political candidates and parties take plenty of cheap shots, but this isn't one of them.
The Republican National Committee is correct that Sen. Barack Obama of Illinios, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, skipped a vote Thursday, Sept. 20, 2007, on a resolution meant to condemn the anti-war group MoveOn.org for an advertisement bashing Army Gen. David Petraues, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq.
The RNC release also correctly notes that Obama canceled a town hall meeting in Rock Hill, S.C., to stay in Washington for ""important votes on the future of America's presence in Iraq.""
It's not uncommon for members of Congress to miss votes because meetings can overlap with floor votes. But in this case, floor action on Iraq dominated the schedule, and Obama participated in the two Senate votes before and after the vote on the MoveOn resolution:
At 11:58 a.m., the Senate voted on an alternative resolution calling for support for the U.S. military. Obama voted yea. It passed.
At 12:35 p.m., the Senate voted on the MoveOn resolution. Obama did not vote. It passed.
At 2:54 p.m., the Senate voted on an amendment to a defense bill that sought to end most funding for the war in Iraq by June. Obama voted yea. It failed.
In a statement, Obama said he didn't vote on the resolution because it was a ""stunt.""
President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have been fighting Democratic attempts to end the war in Iraq. They have seized on the MoveOn ad, published last week in the New York Times, in hopes of turning public sentiment against anti-war groups, and by extension their Democratic allies. The full-page ad said ""Gen. Petraeus or Gen. Betray Us?"" and questioned whether the general's report to Congress on progress in Iraq would be influenced by the White House.
MoveOn has leveraged its 3-million members to help drive opposition to the war, and in the process the group has become a powerful Democratic ally and fund-raiser.
Among other presidential hopefuls, Sens. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., voted against the MoveOn resolution, while Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sam Brownback, R-Kan., voted for it. Another contender, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also missed the vote, but he was absent from all votes Thursday.
The resolution was offered by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and it passed 72 to 25. Here's the text: ""To express the sense of the Senate that General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces.""
An alternative, offered by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also passed, 50 to 47. All the Republicans opposed it, while all Democrats, including Obama, voted for it. Here's the text: ""To reaffirm strong support for all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and to strongly condemn attacks on the honor, integrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving or has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces, by any person or organization.""",1,Republican National Committee
"""We had a No Child Left Behind — a similar piece of legislation in our state a number of years ago, well before the federal law. And it's had a big impact here. It's improved schools."" The former Massachusetts governor made his comment in response to a question about Fred Thompson's opposition to the No Child Left Behind Act. Romney supports the federal accountability law, and has for some time.
Why?
Because he has seen the effects of holding schools accountable through testing and standards in his own state. He refers specifically to his state's landmark 1993 Education Reform Act, which put such measures in place nine years before No Child took effect.
Romney said the law has had a ""big impact."" And he's right.
In 1998, just 7 percent of high school sophomores were scoring at the ""advanced"" level on the state's math exam. By 2007, 41 percent of sophomores could make that claim.
Over the same period, the percentage of sophomores failing the English exam dropped from 28 percent to 6 percent, with corresponding increases in the top ratings.
In 2005 and again in 2007, the state ranked first, or tied for first, in all four test categories for a widely respected exam commonly known as ""the nation's report card."" The categories are math and reading for fourth and eighth grade. No state had ever done that well across the board.
""In some respects, I would say you can track our success in Massachusetts to the fact that there was this issue of equity in education in the early 1990s,"" said Matt Militello, an assistant professor of educational policy at the University of Massachusetts.
But the achievement gap persists.
David Driscoll, the state's education commissioner in 2005, wrote that the state's performance gaps between white, black and Hispanic students remained unchanged since 2003. In 2007, the state's interim commissioner, Jeffrey Nellhaus, noted again that while the scores of white students were rising, those of black and Hispanic students were flat.
Robert Costrell, Romney's former chief economist and education adviser, doesn't dispute the achievement gap. But he said that doesn't change the overall improvement.
""The gaps are still quite significant and of great concern. But there absolutely was a closing of those gaps,"" said Costrell, now a professor of education reform and economics at the University of Arkansas.
Ultimately, Romney claims the state made strong progress in education after it passed an accountability law similar to No Child Left Behind, and the test scores back him up.",1,Mitt Romney
"""He was a member of the Iraq Study Group and was either fired or quit from a very important commission that was trying to figure out the way forward in Iraq."" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was indeed an original member of the Iraq Study Group, formed at the request of Congress to conduct a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq.
And he was either fired or quit from that panel after missing two official meetings.
Here's what we know.
Giuliani was appointed to the panel in March 2006, then missed two two-day meetings. On the dates of those meetings, he was paid for lucrative speaking appearances elsewhere.
On April 11-12, 2006, the first official meeting of the Iraq Study Group was held in Washington, D.C. Where was Giuliani? On April 12, he was a keynote speaker at the FT Asian Financial Centers Summit in South Korea. His net fee: $160,000.
The second official meeting of the group was May 18-19, 2006. Where was Giuliani? On May 18, he spoke at the Georgia 100 annual awards breakfast in Atlanta. His net fee: $80,000. Later that day, he attended a $100-a-plate fundraiser for former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, then a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia.
James Baker, secretary of state under the first President Bush, was co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, along with former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Baker declined to comment for this story.
But his co-chair explains how Giuliani left the group.
Hamilton says that after Giuliani told Baker he couldn't attend the second meeting in a row, ""(Baker) said, 'I'm going to have to go to another person.' ""
On May 31, 2006, the group announced former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III would replace Giuliani.
At the time, Giuliani said: ""My previous time commitments do not permit me the full and active participation that the Iraq Study Group deserves.""
It's unclear whether he was fired or forced to quit, but consider this: During his two-month tenure on the panel, between March 15, 2006, and May 24, 2006, Giuliani made 30 paid appearances for a net revenue of $2.25-million, according to his financial disclosure forms.

"""Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem."" A series of Internet posts implying that Muslim parents don’t want their kids to sing the national anthem has continued to cause a stir, mostly by not making it clear to readers that the controversy is actually years old — and in Australia.
""Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem,"" read the headline on a post we first saw Feb. 20, 2017 , on LadyLibertysNews.com. Facebook brought it to our attention as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear its news feeds of fake news.
The post was one of many others across cyberspace that discussed how an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children must sing the national anthem.
Though some choppy grammar and poor editing made it difficult to know what was a direct quote, we gleaned that a Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman named Unthman Badar said the national anthem was part of a concerted effort of ""forced assimilation"" of Muslims by Australian officials.
But the post included two deceptive photos of schoolchildren standing at attention before an American flag in a classroom.
Let’s be clear: There is a controversial pro-Islamic group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir , and their spokesman Uthman Badar (note the spelling difference) did say Muslim children should not sing the national anthem. But what’s not entirely clear from the story is that this happened during a contentious meeting about the strain of Islamic citizens assimilating into Australian culture, held in Sydney on Nov. 1, 2015.
""This imposition of values is manifest in matters such as the insistence of senior government ministers that Muslim children sing the national anthem – an anthem which reflects a particular, disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values ... Why should they be forced to sing it?"" Badar said, according to news reports . (Watch his speech above; the relevant portion starts around the 9:50 mark .)
""It is nothing less than forced assimilation ... sought to be justif­ied by exaggerated fear of a security threat,"" he added .
The Australian anthem reads :
Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We've golden soil and wealth for toil;
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in nature’s gifts;
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair
Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,
We'll toil with hearts and hands,
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands,
For those who've come across the seas
We've boundless plains to share,
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia fair.
The LadyLibertysNews.com story did mention that the story was about Australia, but you had to read carefully to see that.
Their post on Facebook was even more deceptive. It includes the caption, ""If you're offended by our beautiful flag, representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country, you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!"" The LadyLibertysNews.com Facebook page includes a picture of President Donald Trump taking the oath of office and is written from an American perspective.
To the site’s credit, when we contacted them via Facebook message about the post on Feb. 20, they conceded the photo choice was incorrect. Shortly thereafter, they changed the images to a single photo of the Australian flag. As of this writing, they have not amended their Facebook post, which had been shared more than 13,000 times.",0,Bloggers
"""One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth."" John McCain is right: He told them so.
Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics.
As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there.
Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
""There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation,"" McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003.
""Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly.""
Despite McCain's contrary position on how the Bush administration has fought the war, however, pollsters say the public never really picked up on the nuance: He has always been seen as a Bush loyalist on the war, which is increasingly unpopular. And that's problematic for his presidential campaign.
About the only praise McCain has given the Bush administration on the war followed Bush's decision to send 30,000 more troops to Iraq over the past summer. That may have contributed to the sense that McCain was one of the president's men, experts said.
""Six months ago, Republican voters felt that he was in lockstep with the president (on the war) and … he was just going off the edge for the cliff for the president,"" said Dick Bennett, president of the New Hampshire-based American Research Group.
This new ad, which is running in New Hampshire and on his Web site, coupled with the message McCain is taking to campaign stops, is designed to put new emphasis on McCain's differences with an unpopular president over an unpopular war. With it, McCain hopes to turn a neat political trick: Supporting the overall policy, while reminding people that he would have done it differently.
As for his claim that just ""one man"" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq.
But among his major Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has recently suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.",1,John McCain
"The health care plan for members of Congress ""is no better than the janitor who cleans their offices."" During a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009, an audience member asked President Barack Obama why members of Congress have a different health care plan than the rest of us.
""Why have you not used the bully pulpit to chastise Congress for having two systems of health care, one for all of us and one for them,"" an audience member asked.
Obama answered that lawmakers get a good deal on health care, but that ""their deal is no better than the janitor that cleans their offices because they are part of a federal employee plan. It is a huge pool. You've got millions of people who are part of the pool which means they have enormous leverage with the insurance companies. ... That drives down their costs, and they get a better deal.""
Republican critics of the president's plan have made an issue of coverage for members of Congress, saying that lawmakers should be forced to take the public option, the most basic government-run plan under Obama's proposal. We found Newt Gingrich was largely correct that Democrats have voted against that idea.
The administration has studied the federal benefits program, which gets high marks for efficiency, to get ideas for its own health care proposal.
Obama's description of the federal plan is accurate. Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, federal employees and elected officials can choose from an array of plans, ranging from very basic options that have high deductibles and only carry catastrophic coverage to more expensive coverage that is more comprehensive. It is the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site.
People who opt for the same package will get the same treatment, said Michael Ornstein, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management.
""The benefits, co-pays and deductibles are no different whether you are a career employee like myself or an elected official,"" he said.
For the most part, janitorial staff on Capitol Hill are federal employees, said Eva Malecki, communications officer for the Architect of the Capitol, the office involved in the day-to-day operations of the Capitol complex.
""We do have a few contract workers,"" she said. ""But the majority are federal employees and are therefore covered by the federal employee benefits program. The custodial staff has access to the same benefits as members of Congress.""
We should note that while janitors and members of Congress can choose from the  same menu of plans, members of Congress generally have more money to spend on,  well, anything. Many members of Congress are millionaires.
But Obama is right that lawmakers and janitors are eligible for the same benefits, deductibles and co-pays.",1,Barack Obama
"Mitt Romney previously believed ""that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Now he is ""prolife."" A new ad from John McCain makes the case that Mitt Romney has not always opposed abortion. Romney has acknowledged that this is the case.
When Romney ran for office in Massachusetts — unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1994 and successfully for governor in 2002 — he often said he supported abortion rights.
McCain's ad highlights a few of those statements.
""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,"" Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy.
In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard,"" Romney said.
In 2007, Romney said his views have changed. ""And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been prolife longer than I have,"" he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007.
( PolitiFact.com looked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out our stories here and here .)
McCain's ad accurately conveys Romney's positions now and during the previous times Romney has run for office. The ad clearly labels which statements were made during which campaign.",1,John McCain
"Says Mitt Romney is proposing a ""tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country."" President Barack Obama has repeatedly argued that his Republican rival Mitt Romney is pursuing policies that favor the rich. Recently, Obama offered a specific claim about how wealthier Americans would benefit from Romney’s tax plan.
In a May 5, 2012, campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, ""My opponent won’t tell us how he’d pay for his new, $5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.""
We wondered whether Romney’s tax proposal really would be so generous to millionaires. (The Romney campaign didn't respond to our inquiry for this story.)
First, some background on what Romney is proposing. Here are some of key elements of his plan, according to the campaign’s website.
For individuals:
• Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis
• Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000
• Eliminate the estate tax
• Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax
For corporations:
• Cut the corporate rate to 25 percent
• Make permanent the research and development tax credit
• Switch to a territorial tax system
• Repeal the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax
The Romney campaign's website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. High tax rates ""discourage work and entrepreneurship, as well as savings and investment,"" the website states. ""With 54 percent of private sector workers employed outside of corporations, individual rates also define the incentives for job-creating businesses. Lower marginal tax rates secure for all Americans the economic gains from tax reform.""
And in a speech on March 30, 2012, Romney affirmed his plan to cut taxes for everyone: ""Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. ""
For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles.
The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney’s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney’s two plans, which the group published in March 2012.
Before we look at the center’s analysis, we should note that the group ran two sets of numbers. One version, known as ""current law,"" essentially gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself.
The other version, known as ""current policy,"" assumes that the Bush and AMT tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan  -- a smaller amount of tax savings than Romney would see under the ""current law"" calculation.
It turns out that the ""current policy"" calculation is the one that backs up Obama’s claim. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan.
The ""current law"" analysis shows even bigger gains for millionaires. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center.
And the higher you go on the income scale, the bigger the tax cuts become. Under the center’s more restrictive ""current policy"" method, the top one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers -- those earning $2,868,534 a year -- would get an average tax cut of $725,716. That accounts for 19.4 percent of all the tax cuts’ benefits.",1,Barack Obama
"""(Ronald Reagan) raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California."" As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot.
""You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California,"" Huckabee said. ""It would be $10-billion today.""
Ronald ""Send the welfare bums back to work"" Reagan?
""Basically, yeah,"" said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike.
According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes.
A little context is in order. In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts.
But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases.
This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our ruling here.
Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion.
But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true.",1,Mike Huckabee
"An undocumented immigrant ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."" As authorities continued to investigate the cause of Northern California’s deadly wildfires this week, they refuted what they described as false claims started by the conservative website Breitbart about their investigation.
A Breitbart article on Oct. 17, 2017 said Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.""
Sonoma County sheriff's officials tell a much different story and have called the Breitbart report ""completely false.""
Even so, the article quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report , which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News.
The series of wind-driven fires that started Oct. 8, 2017 has destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings and killed at least 42 people across Northern California. It is the most deadly series of fires in California’s history.
While there’s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages.
We decided to fact check Breitbart’s controversial claim that Gonzalez is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities.
Our research
We started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a press conference on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart’s article was published.
The sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting ""a small fire"" that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff's officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A statement by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.
Here’s the sheriff’s statement at the press conference:
""There’s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires. That’s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don’t even know if it’s arson.""
Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017.
Cal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency.
Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire’s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was ""ongoing"" and that it has ""not yet determined any specific causes.""
He declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff’s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires.
""There’s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame,"" Berlant said. ""When we have an arson suspect, that’s going to be made public immediately.""
Berlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities.
""Completely false, bad, wrong information""
Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart’s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist.
Crum told BuzzFeed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are ""completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way.""
Crum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez's race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him.
""After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls,"" he added. ""There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves.""
The Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment.
In the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued ""a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail"" for Gonzalez.
Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a statement posted online on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request.
He added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said.
The sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a statement this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff’s office related to Gonzalez.",0,Breitbart
"At Bain Capital, ""we helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised."" Mitt Romney said one of his Bain Capital companies has been so successful it's been praised by First Lady Michelle Obama.
Romney’s Aug. 30, 2012, speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa extolled Bain Capital, the private equity and venture capital firm that fueled his wealth, as ""a great American success story.""
""Some of the companies we helped start are names you know you've have heard from tonight. An office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping.
""The Sports Authority, which of course became a favorite of my boys.
""We helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised.
""And at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and build one in the cornfield in Indiana. Today, Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States. These are American success stories.""
What did Michelle Obama say?
Let’s Move!
We asked Romney’s campaign, and did some searching of our own.
The first lady didn’t offer a blanket endorsement of Bright Horizons , a major provider of employer-sponsored child care that’s been named one of Fortune magazine’s ""100 Best Companies to Work for in America.""
Rather, she singled them out for a mention in a June 2011 speech in Washington, D.C., as a new partner for her healthy-kids initiative, Let’s Move.
Her comments were publicized a year later in a Daily Caller article headlined ""Michelle Obama praised Bain Capital-backed child care company,"" as well as by ABC News and Fox Business News with Neil Cavuto.
She was ""singing the praises of a company called Bright Horizons last year"" saying it was ""it was beyond just first-rate,"" Cavuto said.
The coverage focused on a YouTube video that showed the first lady mentioning Bright Horizons . She had visited a child care center — not one managed by Bright Horizons, but rather an unrelated center called CentroNia — to announce ""Let’s Move Child Care."" Providers such as Bright Horizons had agreed to sign on with Partnership for a Healthier America to focus on nutrition and exercise in their centers.
Michelle Obama said:
""The Partnership for a Healthier America is working with private providers like Bright Horizons. That’s the nation’s second largest private child care provider, and they’re going to implement this checklist at nearly 600 child care centers across the country. So we already have commitments that are going to affect hundreds of thousands of children today. Again, that’s why we’re excited to be able to launch this. That's why these partners here today are so important, because we wouldn't have this announcement if we didn't have the folks ready to step up and invest and get the ball rolling and be the models, as CentroNia is, to show that we can do this, and it can work.""
In a related Bright Horizons news release , she was quoted as saying, ""If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they’re not glued to a TV screen all day, they’re on their way to healthy habits for life. That’s why I’m so excited about Let’s Move Child Care – because I know that childcare facilities and home-based providers can be a real building block for an entire generation of healthy kids.""",1,Mitt Romney
"""First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal."" Several news websites have reported that the investigation of wrongdoing involving Uranium One and Hillary Clinton bagged its first indictment.
Facebook users flagged a post from a site called Republican News as suspicious and possibly fake. The website’s Jan. 13 headline said, ""First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal.""
That post echoed similar reporting by the  New York Post , which announced ""there’s an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal,"" also on Jan. 13. The next day,  The Hill  repeated the Post report.
There was an indictment, but the Justice Department doesn’t tie it to the Uranium One deal.
Instead, the charges come out of a 2014 investigation of an American-based kickback scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom.
The kickback scheme and Rosatom's 2010 purchase of a controlling interest in the Canadian company Uranium One were entirely separate. The kickback plan locked in contracts for an American firm to import Russian uranium. The other deal involved buying Uranium One stock. They involved different Rosatom subsidiaries and different activities.
The news reports tied the two together, but none gave details on the connection.
""The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One deal,"" Republican News said. ""THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up.""
But it provided no evidence.
Let’s unpack this.
The indictment
Mark Lambert is the former co-president of Transport Logistics International, a Maryland company that arranged the transport of nuclear materials to the United States. According to the Jan. 12 indictment , between at least as early as 2009 and 2014, Lambert and his partner funneled money to a Russian official with Tenex, the company in charge of exporting Russian uranium.
Through an elaborate kickback scheme, the Maryland firm got the contracts to ship Russian uranium to the United States. Tenex paid handsomely for the firm’s services, and the Maryland firm shared some of the proceeds with the Russian official. In short, Tenex paid for the bribery.
Lambert’s indictment on Jan. 12, 2018, was just the most recent step in a long-running case against his company. That investigation made no mention of Uranium One.
In 2014, the Justice Department charged Lambert’s business partner , the Russian Tenex official and two others (including the wife of the business partner) with bribery, fraud and money laundering. All told, about $2.1 million ended up in overseas bank accounts controlled by the Russian.
For the record, the indictment of the Russian official said the scheme started in 2004. That’s six years before the Uranium One sale was on the table.
Lambert’s business partner and the Russian had pled guilty in 2015. The Russian is serving a two-year prison term, and the business partner is awaiting sentencing.
A Uranium One refresher
In 2010, the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom wanted to become the majority owner of the Canadian firm Uranium One. Uranium One had holdings in the United States, so the deal had to win approval by a number of state and federal agencies. That group included the State Department, then led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Our summary of the case gives plenty of details , but the gist is some of the owners of Uranium One had given millions to the Clinton Foundation. One in particular gave the foundation between $1.3 million and $5.6 million while the sale was under review.
On the 2016 campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump cast the donations as a payoff to grease the skids for approval.
There is no evidence that Clinton had a hand in the vetting process, an undertaking that involved eight federal offices in addition to the State Department.
Recently, Republicans have called for a fresh investigation of the matter. The Justice Department has made no official comment.
The department recently allowed an FBI informant in the Tenex bribery case to testify before a Senate committee investigating the Uranium One transaction. It is unknown what if anything new that informant might provide.
The indictment-Rosatom connection
How does the recent indictment link to the Uranium One sale? Aside from the tie to Rosatom, not in any obvious way.
The Maryland firm was in cahoots with Vadim Mikerin, a Russian national who was the general director of Tenam USA, the American arm of Tenex. Tenex is a subsidiary of JSC Atomenergoprom, which in turn is a subsidiary of Rosatom.
Rosatom bought the controlling share in Uranium One through another subsidiary.
There is no evidence that the kickback scheme that defrauded Tenex overlapped with Rosatom’s efforts to buy Uranium One. None of the news reports that claimed a connection provided any evidence. In fact, the New York Post article incorrectly said, ""The federal investigation grew from charges that the Obama administration covered up an FBI probe of the uranium business — and thus allowed the Russian firm Tenex to buy a stake in Uranium One.""
But Tenex was not the buyer. As a subsidiary of Rosatom, its role was to export Russian uranium, a very different business activity. The Rosatom subsidiary that bought the stake in Uranium One was Atomredmetzoloto.
Law professor Michael Koehler at Southern Illinois University School of Law is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has written about the Tenex prosecutions. He reviewed the indictment and saw no tie between the two matters.
""Last week’s case concerns the same core conduct the Justice Department brought action on in June 2015,"" Koehler said.
While any FBI investigation of the Uranium One deal lies behind a veil of secrecy at the department, Koehler said the idea that it might have spurred the latest indictment is ""highly unlikely.""",0,Republican News
"""As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!"" A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be ""the most left-wing president in our nation's history."" The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, is that, ""As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!""
It's true. But before you go fitting Obama with Hugh Hefner-esque silk pajamas, some explanation is in order.
The bill that came before the Illinois state Senate on March 29, 2001, sought to prohibit adult businesses from being located within 1,000 feet of public or private elementary or secondary schools, public parks, places of worship, preschools, day care facilities, mobile home parks or any areas zoned residential.
Obama argued that kind of regulation is better handled by local officials through zoning. He noted that the City of Chicago opposed the bill as a pre-emption of its home rule.
Addressing the assembly, Obama stated: ""This is one of those areas where nobody likes, necessarily, to have — well, I don't say nobody, but most of us would prefer not to have an adult bookstore or movie theater or something next to our residence. But that's exactly why we have local zoning ordinances. And that's why, presumably, we have council members or heads of townships or all the various branches of local government who are much closer to the ground than we are in making these determinations. And it seems to me that if there's ever been a function that has historically been relegated to local control and it is appropriately there, it's these kinds of zoning matters. I would urge a No vote.""
But Obama didn't actually vote ""no."" He and four others voted ""present."" In the Illinois state Senate, lawmakers sometimes vote ""present"" instead of ""no"" to block bills without officially opposing them. (Earlier in the campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton questioned whether Obama used present votes 129 times over eight years as an Illinois state senator to duck tough votes. PolitiFact examined Obama's present votes here. )
The political considerations here are obvious. Had he voted no, the attack would now be that ""Obama opposed..."" instead of the weaker ""Obama refused to support..."" The small distinction didn't appear to have saved Obama much grief.
The vote came down 33 in favor; 15 against, with 5 voting ""present."" Because the bill needed 36 votes in favor — a three-fifths majority — it narrowly failed.
Any implication that Obama's vote means that he supports sex businesses opening near schools or places of worship would be false. But in Minnery's article, which has been widely circulated through chain e-mail, he states that Obama ""refused to support"" a bill that would have prohibited sex shops near schools and places of worship. That's True.",1,Focus on the Family Action
"""Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax."" Mitt Romney told wealthy donors gathered at a high-dollar campaign fundraiser that there’s a group of voters he believes he can never win over: people who pay no taxes.
Video of Romney speaking at the event, held in Boca Raton, Fla., was leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones on Sept. 17, 2012, stirring up controversy in the heated presidential race.
In his remarks, Romney used broad strokes to characterize millions of people who he said solidly support President Barack Obama.
""There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,"" Romney said in the video . ""All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.
""And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number,"" Romney continued. ""These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""
We’re checking several claims from his remarks at the May 2012 event. Taxes are a contentious issue in the presidential campaign, and the statistic Romney mentioned was sure to pique the attention of the ostensible 1-percenters in his audience.
As for his claim that 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax at all: Guess what? He’s right.
Who pays
It's clear Romney is referring to federal taxes and his figure mirrors one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that in 2011, 46 percent of tax filers paid no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. In 2009, the Tax Policy Center estimated the proportion who paid no taxes was 47 percent.
About half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them.
""For example, a couple with two children earning less than $26,400 will pay no federal income tax this year because their $11,600 standard deduction and four exemptions of $3,700 each reduce their taxable income to zero,"" Roberton Williams, a scholar with the Tax Policy Center, wrote last year . ""The basic structure of the income tax simply exempts subsistence levels of income from tax.""
The remaining Americans who owe no federal income taxes are benefiting from tax breaks, the center found.
""Three-fourths of those households pay no income tax because of provisions that benefit senior citizens and low-income working families with children. Those provisions include the exclusion of some Social Security benefits from taxable income, the tax credit and extra standard deduction for the elderly, and the child, earned income, and child care tax credits that primarily help low-income workers with children,"" he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon examined a claim similar to this one last year, citing research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan committee of Congress. The committee found that for 2009, roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money to them through the tax code. By contrast, the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.
Put another way, 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, according to the committee’s research.",1,Mitt Romney
"""I never called for a partition"" of Iraq. With fresh questions being raised about how to configure Iraq's government, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about a proposal that he advocated in 2007.
""You once advocated for a three-way partition of Iraq because you were not confident that Iraq's government was capable of having a strong central government,"" ABC This Week host Jake Tapper said to Biden during a July 18, 2010, interview .
Tapper then played a video of Biden speaking from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, in which Biden said, ""The most basic premise of President Bush's approach, that the Iraqi people will rally behind a strong central government headed by Maliki, in fact, will look out for their interests equitably, is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It will not happen in anybody's lifetime here, including the pages.""
Asked Tapper: ""Is it possible that you were right back then that it is just impossible to have a centralized government?""
Biden responded by taking issue with the word ""partition"" -- which was often used to describe Biden's plan at the time -- saying it was never about breaking Iraq into three separate countries.
""I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition,"" Biden said. ""I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions.""
""It was to allow them more autonomy,"" Biden said, ""...And so what's happening here is, there is an election that's taken place. And what happened-- there's 325 plus members of what they call their core, their parliament. And no one party won more than 91 seats. The two major parties, one won 89 and one won 91 seats. That's Maliki and Allawi, Iraqiya and the State of Law, they call them.
""They're in negotiations right now to figure out how to allocate the power within that government. In other words, share power. And it is about just that. And it's underway. And it's going to happen. There will be a central government with control of its foreign policy, with control of the military. But you will see that there are going to be significant amounts of autonomy in each of the areas that exist in these provinces. That's what their constitution calls for.""
Check the headlines in 2007, and it's clear that the word ""partition"" or ""soft partition"" was often used to describe Biden's proposal, which called for boundaries to be drawn for the country's Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. And so we decided to check his claim that he never called for a partition.
Biden's strategy was first outlined in an op-ed piece for the New York Times on May 1, 2006, which Biden co-wrote with Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations:
""The idea, as in Bosnia, is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it, giving each ethno-religious group — Kurd, Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab — room to run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in charge of common interests.""
The plan, they wrote would be to ""establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.""
""Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing,"" Biden wrote. ""But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq.""
In 2007, Biden and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, successfully shepherded a nonbinding, ""sense of the Senate"" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions with a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23.
The resolution called for the U.S. to ""actively support a political settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions.""
And last, we point you to the fuller comments Biden made from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, when Biden said the idea that the Iraqi people would rally behind a strong central government was ""fundamentally and fatally flawed.""
As an alternative, Biden said, ""You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. You separate the parties. You give them breathing room. Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility.
""Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for. I can't guarantee that my strategy will work, but I can guarantee that the road the president (Bush) has us on leads to nowhere with no end in sight.""
Biden addressed the ""partition"" issue head-on in an Oct. 3, 2007 op-ed co-written with Gelb for the Washington Post : ""Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue.""
So is it fair to call Biden's plan a call to ""partition"" Iraq? Certainly Biden advocated carving out three semi-autonomous regions. In that sense, we could see why many characterized Biden's proposal as a ""soft partition."" But the word ""partition"" carries heavy political implications, namely the creation of three separate nations. And that was never Biden's plan. He consistently upheld the idea of one Iraq with a central government, albeit a more modest one responsible for such things as defense, foreign affairs and sharing oil revenues. That's an important distinction.",1,Joe Biden
"Says the Congressional Budget Office estimates a cap-and-trade program would cost the average family the equivalent of ""a postage stamp a day."" Responding to Republicans who have said a cap-and-trade bill could cost thousands of dollars a year for the average family, the Democratic sponsors of the bill are citing a new study from the Congressional Budget Office that they say shows their plan will be affordable.
""For the cost of about a postage stamp a day, all American families will see a return on their investment as our nation breaks our dependence on foreign oil, cuts dangerous carbon pollution and creates millions of new clean-energy jobs that can't be shipped overseas,"" Rep. Edward Markey said in a June 22, 2009, news release jointly issued with the co-sponsor, Rep. Henry Waxman.
Waxman and Markey, from California and Massachusetts respectively, are the authors of a bill that would set up a market for power companies and other polluters to buy and trade carbon credits. The goal is to force them to cut their harmful emissions and lower carbon pollution 83 percent by 2050. But critics say polluters will inevitably pass the cost of buying credits or cleaner technologies on to the consumer.
Putting a price tag on such a complex plan is tricky and controversial, as we note in our article Your Guide to the Cap-and-Trade Estimates . The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that cap-and-trade could raise the average family's annual energy bill by $1,241. House Republicans have said that cap-and-trade could cost consumers up to $3,100, a figure they say came from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report. But the writers of that report admonished the GOP for incorrectly interpreting their work; intially, the authors predicted it would cost consumers about $340 annually, and have since updated that estimate to $800.
Waxman and Markey are relying on a June 19 Congressional Budget Office analysis of their bill. The CBO is a well-respected, independent arm of Congress, but we have found its findings are occasionally mischaracterized by members of Congress. So we wanted to check whether Waxman is correctly summarizing the CBO's findings.
Indeed, the report cited by Markey and Waxman predicts the bill would have a net annual economywide cost of $22 billion — or about $175 per household — in 2020. Divide that number by 365 days, and you get about 48 cents. A first-class stamp costs 44 cents, so Waxman is close.
The CBO's estimate includes several assumptions about important decisions that still must be made by Congress, such as how much energy companies will pay to buy and trade polluting credits. But it's worth reading the fine print on this one, because CBO notes that the actual cost per family will vary depending on income. For example, low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year, while wealthy people will see a net increase for energy costs of $235 to $340 every year. And the analysis does not include the costs or benefits of other parts of the bill, such as government efforts to quickly develop new technology, wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf in a June 20 blog post.
It's also important to note that the costs will vary year to year. As the bill stands, polluting allowances will initially be given away for free. But by 2035, about 70 percent of those allocations will be sold by the government. Supporters of the bill say federal revenue from the program would be used to pay for tax credits and rebates for the middle class.
CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.
Waxman and Markey are clear about these variables and omissions in their press statement. They note that the poorest people will gain from the bill, and point out that the study does not include every element that could contribute to cap-and-trade's cost.
But critics are more skeptical of the report. By not including all variables, the CBO report ""grossly underestimates costs of cap-and-trade,"" said a memo from the Heritage Foundation, which has published many articles opposing the proposal. Among other things, Heritage says the study is flawed because it doesn't address economic changes resulting from restricted energy use and potential job losses.
For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are not addressing which study is best, but focusing on whether Markey correctly described the CBO's findings. He was close — off by just 4 cents — and he indicated it was an approximation because he said ""about a postage stamp a day.",1,Edward  Markey
"""John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time."" Update: This item has been updated, but the new information didn't change the ruling.
If you've been following the Democratic National Convention, you've doubtless heard any number of speakers cite the statistic that Sen. John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time. There's no mystery to the Democratic strategy here: A vote for McCain amounts to four more years of Bush, whose approval rating is hovering near an abysmal 30 percent.
So it came as no surprise when Sen. Barack Obama cited the statistic in his major convention address.
""But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.""
The number is based on a ""presidential support"" score from Congressional Quarterly, which rates how often lawmakers back or oppose the president. Since 2001, McCain has, in fact, backed the president's position an average of 90 percent of the time. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep.
McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005; and as high as 95 percent of the time in 2007. We should also note some factors that helped to drive up McCain's 2007 score, which was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. That year, McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief Republican adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters.
Over the course of the election, we've looked at this statistic a couple of times, and in a couple variations.
In June, we ruled it True when Obama said ""McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)."" But we dinged running mate Joe Biden a bit when he said at an Aug. 23, 2008, rally in Springfield, Ill.,
""You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time."" Because Biden didn't note a year when he cited McCain's highest ""presidential support"" score — thereby suggesting an overall score — we ruled his statement only Half True.
Here, Obama cites McCain's average presidential support score since Bush was elected. We checked our math, and although we had first said Obama was off by 1 percent, we have since realized that Obama wasn't, we were. It's 90 percent on the nose. True.",1,Barack Obama
"""There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money."" The Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohammed Morsi amid major anti-government protests has prompted some American politicians to urge the U.S. to hold back some or all of the roughly $1.5 billion in aid it gives annually to Egypt. Those who support an aid cutoff argue that despite the popular uprising, the military’s removal of a democratically elected leader undermines democracy, requiring a negative response from the U.S.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went a step further, arguing that Egyptians don’t even want the aid we give their country in the first place. (Paul is a longtime critic of foreign aid in general.)
In a Fox News interview on July 8, 2013 , host Eric Bolling asked Paul why President Barack Obama hadn’t called the ouster a ""coup.""
Paul responded, ""You know, I think they are confused on this. They, like so many supporters of foreign aid, think that that's how we buy friendship around the world, that's how we influence people. But the interesting thing is, there was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money. So, they burn our flag, they don't want our money and we say, ‘Oh, here, you must take it, or we want you to behave and act like Americans.’ But there isn't a whole lot of real democracy going on over there.""
We wondered whether Paul was right about the high level of public opposition to U.S. assistance in Egypt.
The answer is that Paul is right. In fact, the opposition to aid is even more widespread among Egyptians than he had indicated.
In a February 2012 poll , Gallup asked Egyptians, ""Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt?"" Gallup pollsters found that 82 percent opposed such aid.
That was the highest level of opposition recorded in six Gallup polls between April 2011 and February 2012. Even the lowest level of opposition found in these polls -- 52 percent in April 2011 -- meant that a majority opposed U.S. aid. So it’s a stance that seems pretty widespread in Egypt in recent years.
In a September 2012 analysis of its survey results, Gallup wrote that ""Egyptians may resent U.S. aid for the same reason some members of Congress are calling it into question -- it is seen as a tool of U.S. influence with Egypt's government.""
The attitudes Gallup found are mirrored in Pew poll data from spring 2013.
Pew asked Egyptians, ""Overall, would you say U.S. economic aid to Egypt is having a mostly positive impact, a mostly negative impact, or no impact on the way things are going in Egypt?""
Overall, 24 percent of respondents said ""mostly positive,"" 55 percent said ""mostly negative"" and 18 percent said ""no impact."" When the wording of the question was varied to say ""military"" aid rather than ""economic"" aid, attitudes turned even more negative. Ten percent of respondents said ""mostly positive,"" 58 percent said ""mostly negative"" and 28 percent said ""no impact.""
These findings rang true with experts we contacted.
""There is no doubt that there are large numbers of Egyptians who don’t want our aid,"" said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
While Paul’s claim is accurate, there’s one thing worth noting.
The polls Gallup (and Pew) conducted did not use the familiar telephone-based random sampling technique most commonly seen in the United States. The Gallup poll used face-to-face interviews conducted in Arabic with 1,000 adults age 15 and older. Gallup has explained that face-to-face surveys are ""normally conducted … by dividing a given population into blocks of roughly equal population density. Each block is further divided into blocks until a single household is chosen at random, and then a single respondent is randomly chosen from the household.""
The use of this methodology doesn’t mean such polls aren’t trustworthy -- if U.S.-style telephone methods had been workable in Egypt, Gallup could have used them -- but the approach is so different that we think it’s a point worth noting.
According to Gallup, the margin of sampling error for the April 2012 survey was 3 percentage points, though the company also acknowledges that ""question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls."" Pew, for its part, makes clear that security concerns for pollsters made it impossible to include about 2 percent of the population that lives in ""frontier"" regions.",1,Rand Paul
"The balanced-budget amendment once came within one vote of passing Congress but was defeated because of the no vote from a top Senate Republican, and Rick Santorum says he ""stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship."" A Republican lodestar this year is passage of a balanced budget amendment , a constitutional change requiring Washington to balance its books every year, with some exceptions, such as if the country is at war.
So far, the proposal has failed to get the two-thirds majority required in the U.S. House, falling short in a 261-165 vote on Nov. 18, 2011.
It’s slated to be voted on by the Senate in December -- a vote was a requirement of last summer’s debt-ceiling deal -- but two-thirds passage there is unlikely given that the chamber is controlled by Democrats, even though some have supported it in the past.
Even if the measure were to clear Congress, it would still need approval from legislatures in 38 states to become part of the Constitution.
Nonetheless, it remains a key talking point for Republicans on the presidential campaign trail. And in a Nov. 29, 2011, op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asserted that the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of passing Congress and going to the states during his first year in the Senate. He also said that he’s not afraid to expose fellow Republicans who stand in its way.
""The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work,"" Santorum wrote. ""The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding ‘no’ vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.""
Did that really happen? And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue?
Santorum campaign aide Matt Benyon said his boss was referring to a vote in 1995, Santorum’s first year in the Senate, and that the Republican in question was the late Mark Hatfield , who died in August 2011 at 89.
Santorum on Jan. 4, 1995, became a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate. This was the era when Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich’s Contract With America, had swept into power in the House and Senate, and the amendment, then as now, was a major part of their agenda.
It passed the House, with more than the two-thirds majority required, on a 300-132 vote on Jan. 26, 1995, but failed to reach the two-thirds mark by one vote in the U.S. Senate on a 65-35 vote on March 2, 1995.
While several Democrats voted for the measure -- including then-U.S. Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Paul Simon, D-Ill., and current Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa -- the lone Republican to oppose the measure was Hatfield. The Oregon Republican and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the measure a ""procedural gimmick."" Santorum, then only 36 (the New York Times pointed out that Hatfield was first elected governor of Oregon in 1958,  the year Santorum was born), called for the veteran lawmaker to be stripped of his committee leadership, as did some other young Republican Turks.
""He can vote against the balanced-budget amendment. But he shouldn’t be in leadership,"" Santorum said at the time.
""This is an issue that is at the core of what Republicanism is all about … I see this as a major stumbling block in the way of the agenda.""
For his part, Hatfield, who had served in the Senate for 28 years at that point, stood his ground, saying, ""I do not care for the implication -- and I only say implication -- that perhaps a conscience vote is no longer possible on the Republican side of the aisle.""
A variety of senior Republican lawmakers, ranging from North Carolina’s Jesse Helms to Vermont’s Jim Jeffords, spoke in favor of Hatfield's right to break ranks on the issue.
Defending Hatfield at the time, Jeffords told the Times, ""He is a moderate, and moderates can make or break this Senate. Either we can have compromise, or we can have gridlock.""
Hatfield held onto his committee chairmanship, though he opted not to run for a sixth term in 1996.",1,Rick Santorum
"""The NRA used to support expanded background checks."" After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote , calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington.""
Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases.
At one point, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. ""Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks,"" he said. ""The current leader of the NRA"" -- referring to Wayne LaPierre -- ""used to support these background checks.""
This echoed a similar claim we checked earlier this year. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on NBC’s Meet the Press that ""if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.""
We’ll recap what we found when checking the comment Bloomberg made.
On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier.
To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy.
First on that list was this:
""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said . ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.""
He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows, and keeping schools gun-free.
There’s additional evidence, too.
New York magazine , in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.""
We contacted the NRA for our previous story but did not receive a response. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN , ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work.""
LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.
""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?""
LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law.""
The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks.",1,Barack Obama
"John McCain has said the economy is ""not his strong suit."" Mitt Romney touts his business and executive experience as evidence he would deftly steer the economy as president. At the same time, he blasts rival John McCain as lacking when it comes to the economy.
""He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,"" Romney said at a campaign stop in Denver. ""Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.""
Did Sen. McCain say that? He denied it at a Republican debate in Boca Raton, Fla., when journalist Tim Russert questioned him about it.
Tim Russert: ""Senator McCain, you have said repeatedly, 'I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues.  I still need to be educated.' Is it a problem for your campaign that the economy is now the most important issue, one that, by your own acknowledgement, you're not well versed on?""
McCain:  ""Actually, I don't know where you got that quote from.  I'm very well versed in economics.""
It seems that Romney and Russert are both right on this point, while McCain is contradicting his previous statements.
McCain gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in 2005 in which he said, ""I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.""
He told the Boston Globe in December 2007, """"The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should.""
Russert followed up a few days later in a one-on-one interview with McCain. McCain acknowledged the quotes and gave the following response:
McCain: ""Okay. Let me tell you what I was trying to say and what I meant in that soundpiece. I spent 22 years in the military. I spent 20 years in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I've been involved in national security issues all my life.  I attended the National War College.  Of course I know more about national security than any other issue.  That's been my entire life.  Am I smart on economics?  Yes.  I was chairman of the Commerce Committee. That's why people like Phil Gramm, Tom Coburn and Warren Rudman and Carly Fiorina and the real strong economic minds, Jack Kemp, the real strong minds on the economy and conservatives on the economy are supporting me.  Of course, I always have things to learn, and I continue to learn every day.  But I'm very strong on the economy, and, frankly, my economic record is a lot stronger than that of the governor of Massachusetts when you look at his record as governor.""
McCain's explanation doesn't change the fact that he did say that economics was not his strong suit.",1,Mitt Romney
"Polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks."" Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents on Jan. 8, 2011, has become a leading advocate for Americans who support tighter restrictions on guns.
More than two years later, the Senate moved to consider an amendment that would have expanded background checks. But the amendment failed to win the necessary 60 votes to proceed to a final vote.
The day after the vote, Giffords wrote an op-ed for the New York Times decrying that vote.
In her op-ed, Giffords wrote, ""Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.""
Under current law, background checks are required in sales made by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales . The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, argues that an expansion would fail to deter criminals.
Here, we will check Giffords’ claim that polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks.""
To do this, we will look at national survey data from media and academic polls taken in the month prior to Giffords’ column. Here’s a rundown of all such polls we could find that addressed an expansion of background checks:
• Washington Post-ABC News poll, April 11-14, 2013 : ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 86 percent. Oppose: 13 percent.
• CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , April 5-7, 2013 : ""Some proposals would require a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony or has a mental health problem. Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for a prospective gun buyer under each of the following circumstances. ... If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun at a gun show."" Favor: 83 percent. Oppose: 17 percent.
""If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun from another person who is not a gun dealer but owns one or more guns and wants to sell one of them."" Favor: 70 percent. Oppose: 29 percent.
""If the buyer is purchasing a gun from a family member or receiving it as a gift."" Favor: 54 percent. Oppose: 45 percent.
""Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for anyone who wants to buy ammunition for a gun."" Favor: 55 percent. Oppose: 44 percent.
• Quinnipiac University poll, March 26-April 1, 2013 . ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 91 percent. Oppose: 8 percent.
• CBS News poll, March 20-24, 2013 . ""Would you favor or oppose background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 90 percent. Oppose: 8 percent.
Giffords’ claim is well-founded, in part because it’s not overly specific: In four polls over the prior month, between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents said they would favor an expansion of the current background check regime. We think any reasonable person would conclude that those percentages qualify as ""overwhelming.""
Giffords would have had more trouble finding support for her claim had she either set a numerical threshold or had she been more specific about the kind of background checks Americans are comfortable with.
For instance, when Obama spoke shortly after the amendment’s failure in the Senate, he cited 90 percent support for an expansion of background checks not once but five times in fairly brief remarks. In the survey results we found, half of the polls crossed that threshold and half did not (though those that didn’t are fairly close).
Meanwhile, the results of the CNN poll suggest that Americans do not support all possible expansions of background checks to the same extent. Checks at gun shows found 83 percent support, but private sales between a willing seller and a willing buyer garnered 70 percent backing, while checks for transfers to family members or for the purchase of ammunition only reached the mid 50-percent range.",1,Gabrielle Giffords
"""Two years ago...I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them [subprime lending] is something we have to deal with."" As the U.S. and world economic systems continue to falter, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama claim to have seen the crisis coming to some degree, and tried to head it off.
McCain has cited his endorsement of legislation in 2006 that would have reined in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac somewhat. And at the second presidential debate, Obama cited a letter he wrote to federal officials ""two years ago.""
""Understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system,"" Obama said during the Oct. 7, 2008 debate. ""Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.
""I wrote to (Treasury) Secretary (Henry) Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman (Ben) Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.""
The last sentence appeared to refer to this letter that Obama sent to Paulson and Bernanke on March 22, 2007.
Obama's comments in the debate suggest the letter warned about the then-looming subprime lending crisis and its potential impact on the wider economy.
So let's check the text.
""There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures,"" he wrote. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes.""
He went on to suggest the two officials convene a homeownership-preservation summit where banks, investors, regulators and consumers could forge a plan to stave off foreclosures.
""Rampant foreclosures are in nobody’s interest... There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy,"" he wrote.
So yes, Obama characterized the letter accurately. In it, he not only called for action to head off the unraveling of the subprime mortgage market, but also warned about its impact on the nation's economy. He sent the letter about 18 months ago, a time frame for which ""two years"" is a fair estimate.",1,Barack Obama
"When it comes to fighting terrorism, ""Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture."" The day after the March 22 terrorist attack in Brussels, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Stanford University talking about ISIS, the threat of terrorism and whether torture is a useful tool to fight it.
""One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims,"" she said, adding, ""Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture.""
""Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk,"" Clinton said.
Most of us can see ourselves spilling the beans on anything and everything if we were subjected to the kinds of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" that suspected terrorists have been subjected to by the United States since 9/11.
We wondered if, as Clinton contended, it has been well established that torture does not work.
Tell them what they want to hear
Because nobody's going to volunteer to be part of a scientific study where you might get tortured — ethics review boards might be apoplectic about such a proposal — the only way to examine the issue is through case studies.
The experts with whom we spoke said that, for a host of reasons, torture has long been recognized as an inefficient way to get information.
The biggest problem is that it tends to produce wrong information. The United States Army Field Manual warns that information gathered by torture can be faulty.
That's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear.
""It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements,"" said Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.)
One example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida's chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. Critics say that's because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged.
Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had ""information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11,"" said Hajjar in a review article in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. ""This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop.""
Bad truth detectors
Interrogators aren’t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth.
""Interrogators in these situations think they're perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently,"" said Darius Rejali , a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability ""make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin.""
In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated, the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence.
""The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don't know anything, and they're claiming that they do,"" said Rejali.
That opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture informants.
""Sleep deprivation will make you imagine you were there shooting (President John) Kennedy behind the grassy knoll,"" said Rejali.
Another issue is that news reports of torture turn public opinion against authorities who condone or permit torture.
Rejali cited the cases of a 2005 bombing attempt in London. When video of the bomber aired, ""the parents came forward and said, 'He's our son. He's the killer.' Would the parents have come forward if they knew their son was going to be tortured? You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no.""
""Not only does torture undermine what we know works, which is public cooperation, but it can also deeply alter the duration, severity and cost of a conflict,"" he said.
""Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts,"" said Hajjar.
Senate torture report
When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , released when Democrats controlled the Senate.
The full document, about 6,700 pages and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014. There's also a minority report developed by Republicans on the committee and a CIA response .
The majority report says techniques such as waterboarding, standing sleep deprivation, forced feeding through a rectal tube, temperature extremes and confinement in coffin-sized boxes were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The committee's analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly ""saved lives"" — cited by the CIA and the Bush administration — found either that the key information was gathered before torture began, the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated, or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees.
For example , the majority report says that ""CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports.""
Another example: The CIA said Ghul, the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden, had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information. The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation.
Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation — described by the president as tough, safe, lawful and necessary — produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked .
The minority report says that in many of the 20 cases, enhanced interrogation tactics did produce significant breakthroughs, although sometimes as part of a delayed cascade effect.
The problem with most of the accounts of people who say that torture works, said Rejali, is that only the cases where it seemed to succeed are remembered and the ones where it didn't are forgotten.
""In the two and a half years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies arrested more that 5,000 suspected terrorists,"" said Mark Costanzo of Claremont McKenna College and Ellen Gerrity of Duke University, writing in the journal Social Issues and Policy Review. ""There was sufficient hard evidence to bring formal charges against only three of these suspects, and only one of these three was convicted.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Seven of the 10 highest-income counties in the country ring the city"" of Washington D.C. Supersize soda in hand, Sarah Palin rallied the CPAC crowd with barbs at ""liberal media folk,"" jokes about President Barack Obama’s background and even a shout of ""You lie!""
Her speech at the annual meeting of conservative activists emphasized the need to rebuild the country -- not the Republican Party -- with an anti-Washington focus.
""The permanent political class is in permanent campaign mode. So where do we go from here?"" Palin said . ""... At a time when Washington is so powerful that seven of the 10 highest-income counties in the country ring the city, allow yourself to imagine leadership that deigns to understand us little people, us clinging to our God, our guns, our Constitution and the grass roots!""
Palin isn’t the first to cite that statistic about the wealth concentration in the nation’s capital. ( PolitiFact Ohio checked it out earlier this year.) Here’s a fresh look.
The statistic comes from the 2011 American Community Survey, a yearly estimate of population characteristics put out by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The data was released last fall, and the Washington Post compiled it into a ""Top 100"" list . Indeed, seven of the top 10 are in the greater Washington, D.C. area:
1 - Loudon County, Va., median income $119,134
2 - Fairfax County, Va., median income $105,797
3 - Arlington County, Va., median income $100,735
5 - Howard County, Md., median income $98,953
7 - Prince William County, Va., median income $95,146
8 - Fauquier County, Va., median income $93,762
10 - Montgomery County, Md., $92,909
So Palin’s claim is on the money. We wondered: What’s making the nation’s capital so well-off?
Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, told PolitiFact some of the factors: ""The D.C. area ranks third in the U.S. in the number of workers per household and second in labor-force participation rate, among the lowest in unemployment, and No. 1 in years completed in school ...  We also work predominantly in professional and business services, and this is what explains this high ranking.""
Salim Furth, senior policy analyst for macroeconomics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, mentioned two other rankings: Washington is third in the country in both millionaires per capita and median gross rent.
""That seems to me like poor people are getting priced out, and that helps push up your income stats if you can only stay here if you get a great job -- and the federal government gives really great jobs,"" he said.
Those statistics: there are 320,000 federal jobs in the D.C. area, and 55 percent of them pay $100,000 per year or more, he said.
And even though that salary doesn’t go as far as it would in, say, rural Mississippi, ""it doesn’t eat up all of the wage gains,"" Furth said.
Beyond the federal jobs, there are also industries concentrated around Washington because of the government presence, such as lobbyists, the defense industry and federal contractors.
""There really is a lot of wealth here,"" Furth said. ""There’s definitely a feel of everybody’s wealthy, everybody has nice things. You should dress up nice to go out. Drinks are expensive in a bar. Rent is expensive even if you’re in a crummy neighborhood.""",1,Sarah Palin
"""Ten years ago, John McCain offered a bill that said he would ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists."" Special interests and lobbyists are perennial topics for political campaigns, and Sen. Barack Obama has made them a repeated target in his attacks on Sen. John McCain.
""Ten years ago, John McCain offered a bill that said he would ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists,"" Obama said. ""He did this because he said that having lobbyists on your campaign was a conflict of interest. This is what he said 10 years ago. Well, I'll tell you John McCain then would be pretty disappointed with John McCain now, because he hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign. And when he was called on it, his top lobbyist had the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this.""
(We checked the statement about McCain hiring ""some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign"" and ruled it True. Also, we ruled it True that McCain's top lobbyist did have ""the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this."")
We delved into legislative history and found that McCain did introduce a bill, in 1996 and again in 1997, to ban lobbyists from being paid by political campaigns. The Lobbying Conflict of Interest Elimination Act said that ""a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees shall not make disbursements for any services rendered by any individual during any period if such individual was required to register for such period as a lobbyist.""
McCain made remarks recorded in the Congressional Record about the bill on Jan. 22, 1997: ""Registered lobbyists who work for campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. When a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that member, the perception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation would stop such practices.""
The bill never made it out of committee.
It was part of a flurry of campaign finance reform legislation proposed in the aftermath of the 1996 campaign for president, during which Bill Clinton raised large amounts of ""soft money,"" the unregulated gifts to political parties from individuals, corporations and unions. At least 57 pieces of legislation were filed in the spring of 1997, according to news reports from the time.
One of those pieces of legislation included comprehensive reform banning soft money, sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin. The McCain-Feingold bill didn't succeed that year, but in 2002 it did pass and was signed into law by President Bush as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. Though considered landmark legislation, it did not address lobbyists working for campaigns.
Obama's description of McCain's legislation from a decade ago is accurate. We rule his statement True. For more on the other aspects of Obama's attack, see our story here.",1,Barack Obama
"""Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with ... the worst chapter in American history. ... And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks."" In the third, final and most combative debate, Sen. John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of failing to repudiate nasty statements against McCain involving racial politics.
“Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful,” McCain said during the Hofstra University debate on Oct. 15, 2008.
“And, Senator Obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks.”
McCain referred to comments by Rep. Lewis, D-Georgia, who is an icon in the civil rights movement. In a statement Oct. 11, 2008, Lewis related the tenor of McCain campaign events to political tactics by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace that encouraged attacks over people seeking civil rights protections in the 1960s.
“What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history,” Lewis wrote. “Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division, and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse.”
Lewis issued his statement after news reports catalogued a series of McCain campaign events in which some audience members shouted such things as “terrorist” and “kill him” when Obama’s name was mentioned by the speakers. The remarks came as the McCain campaign embarked on a decidedly aggressive approach, focusing on Obama’s long-ago association with 1960s radical William Ayers.
But the question is whether Obama was silent when Lewis likened the tone of the McCain rallies to those of Wallace and the segregationists. Obama’s campaign did break with Lewis’ statement the same day he made it, although it also said Lewis “was right to condemn” statements by Palin associating Obama with terrorists.
Here’s the statement Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued on Oct. 11:
“Senator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies.  But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night, as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States ‘pals around with terrorists.’
“As Barack Obama has said himself, the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry, divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together.  That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead.”
But that statement never explicitly said Lewis was wrong — which is crucial to repudiating someone or something. Instead, Obama’s campaign said Lewis’ comparison wasn’t correct.
In the debate, Obama did say Lewis “inappropriately drew a comparison” between the civil rights trouble and McCain rallies.
Lewis later said he could have phrased his words differently, because he didn’t want to relate McCain and Palin directly to Wallace’s tactics. But he said he accomplished his goal of highlighting the dangerous tone of the rallies.
Obama’s campaign did promptly issue a statement, disputing the comparison that Lewis made. But that’s not the same as “repudiating” or admonishing Lewis for making that comparison.",1,John McCain
"""Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Service flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years."" Honest mistake. That's the line from the Obama team about the tax problems that have sparked controversy about treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner.
The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004. By law, the IRS could not audit him for years prior to 2003.
So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax and interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years. As far as the IRS was concerned, case closed.
Fast forward to late 2008. The Obama transition team began to vet Geithner in preparation for Obama nominating him to his Cabinet. The transition team found a few problems in Geithner's previous tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002.  So last month, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after.
Some opponents of Geithner's nomination find this second payment particularly troubling.
""Treasury Secretary Nominee Timothy Geithner's failure to pay four years’ worth of self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare is absolutely astonishing,"" John Berlau, director of the Center for Investors & Entrepreneurs at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a news release on Jan. 14, 2009. ""And as more details are released, Geithner's actions seem even more disturbing. According to the New York Times, Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years. To have him leading the department that manages the IRS would be a slap in the face to the millions of self-employed Americans who fulfill their responsibilities to correctly asses their tax burdens.""
Berlau's organization is a conservative think tank ""dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and limited government."" His criticism is typical of those who are opposing Geithner's nomination.
By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required pay them on their own.
But let's put aside for the moment the issue of whether Geithner should have known he was obligated to pay the self-employment taxes (Republicans have correctly noted that Geithner got ample documentation from the IMF informing him of his tax obligation). There's still the issue of the 2001 and 2002 taxes that Geithner didn’t pay until the presidential transition team pointed it out.
First off, tax experts say that due to a statute of limitations, Geithner was under no legal obligation to pay the taxes related to 2001 and 2002. The IRS could only go back three years. So Geithner was legally in the clear.
But considering that the IMF pays extra money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset those self-employment taxes, some have questioned whether Geithner had a moral or ethical obligation to square up with the government. After the IRS pointed out in 2006 that Geithner had not paid his self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, it stands to reason Geithner would then have known that he also didn’t pay in 2001 and 2002.
""You have to ask yourself, 'Would you do it?'"" asked Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center.
That's an issue the Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing will have to weigh.
But as for Berlau's statement that Geithner ""still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years,"" Berlau is right. Geithner didn’t make good on the previous years until he learned he was in line to be treasury secretary. We rule the statement True.",1,Competitive Enterprise Institute
"""In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure."" At a Republican presidential debate in senior-rich Florida, Mitt Romney took Rick Perry to task on Social Security.
""In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure,"" Romney said in the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011.
Here's the full quote:
WOLF BLITZER: ""Gov. Romney, you said that Gov. Perry's position on Social Security is, quote, unacceptable and could even obliterate the Republican Party. Are you saying he could not, as Republican nominee, beat Barack Obama?""
MITT ROMNEY: ""No, what I'm saying is that what he just said, I think most people agree with, although the term Ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people. But the real issue is in writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that in his view that Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states.
""And I think that view, and the view that somehow Social Security has been forced on us over the past 70 years that by any measure, again quoting book, by any measure Social Security has been a failure, this is after 70 years of tens of millions of people relying on Social Security, that's a very different matter.""
Romney's source? Perry's 2010 book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington.
We pulled out our copy and found the correct passage. (Read more from PolitiFact about Perry's book.)
Five pages into a section called, ""Runaway Entitlement Spending,"" on Page 62, Perry writes:
By any measure, Social Security is a failure. As author Jim Powell points out in FDR's Folly, one pro-FDR historian justified Social Security not on its merits but as an important ""symbolic gesture to demonstrate that Roosevelt's heart was in the right place."" This sounds a lot like justifying the current administration's policies because well-meaning politicians want to provide ""hope.""
Now, if you say Social Security is a failure, as I have just done, you will inherit the wind of political scorn. Seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for. Politicians will seek to take advantage, stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another ""heartless Republican."" I get it. That's why only retired senators chair entitlement commissions.
We are told that no politician has the courage to raise these issues, even if avoiding them puts us on the fast track to financial run. But by remaining quiet, politicians are really saying they think the American people won't understand it if we share the grim details of our financial future, and that voters will simply kill -- or vote against -- the messenger in order to continue to receive an underfunded benefit that robbed them of the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made.
Is that how we should respect our fellow citizens?
So indeed, Perry said Social Security ""is a failure;"" he even acknowledged that doing so means he will ""inherit the wind of political scorn.""
What did Perry mean by ""the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made""? In the same section of the book he says payroll taxes would have been better left in workers' pockets: ""If only the New Dealers had been kind enough to allow workers to make their own choice about whether to participate. As we know from experience, individuals would have done better on their own.""
He points out that ""many private pension plans return 8 percent per year, compared to Social Security's paltry 2 percent or less."" Then he offers the example of three Texas counties that opted out of Social Security for a private option before that door was shut in 1983.
""Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits.""
He doesn't address Social Security's other roles, such as disability insurance and survivor's benefits, nor what he believes should happen to low-income workers who under Social Security draw more in retirement benefits then they're able to contribute in payroll taxes.
Does Perry stand by his 2010 book? Less than a month ago he told a reporter in Des Moines, ""I haven't backed off anything in my book. So read the book again and get it right.""
On Sept. 11, 2011, he clarified for  USA Today , ""As I said at the Reagan Library recently, Social Security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected. For younger workers, we must consider reforms to make Social Security financially viable.""
But Romney made it clear he was quoting from Perry's book. He said ""In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure."" And indeed, in Perry's book, Fed Up!, he touts the benefits of private plans and says: ""By any measure, Social Security is a failure.",1,Mitt Romney
"""The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression."" In an Aug. 29, 2011, column , Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a frequent liberal commentator, offered a number of statistics to back up his call for worker protests rather than parades on Labor Day.
""Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades,"" Reich’s column began. ""But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade.""
One of the statistics Reich offered was this: ""The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression.""
A reader asked us to check this out, so we did.
We turned to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal office that calculates official statistics about the economy. We found numbers for corporate profits as well as for two measures of worker income -- wage and salary disbursements, and total employee compensation received. We then divided corporate profits by both of the income measurements, all the way back to 1929. ( Here are the full statistics from 1929 to 2011 as we calculated them.)
For wages, we found that Reich was essentially correct. The ratio in 2010 -- the last full year in the statistics -- was .281, which was higher than any year back to at least 1929, the earliest year in the BEA database. The next highest ratio was in 2006, at .265. (We didn’t find pre-1929 data, so the one part of Reich’s statement that we can’t prove is that the ratio was higher ""just before the Great Depression."")
We also looked at total compensation, since the portion of worker compensation delivered outside of wages has grown significantly since 1929. The numbers were slightly different, but the general pattern still held. The ratio in 2010 was .226, which was matched or exceeded in only four years -- 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1950.
To capture the most up-to-date trends, we also looked at the ratios for the last six quarters. For both wages and compensation, the ratio has risen steadily over that year-and-a-half period. For wages, the ratio has climbed from .274 in the first quarter of 2010 to .290 in the second quarter of 2011. For compensation, the ratio has risen from .220 in the first quarter of 2010 to .234 in the second quarter of 2011.
So numerically, there’s little question that Reich is essentially right. (Or, at least for now he is. Economists note that statistics about corporate profits and wages are often revised after the fact.) A more interesting question is what this trendline actually means.
First, we’ll note that the ratio has been remarkably steady over the time we studied. In 2010, corporate income was 168 times what it was in 1929, and wages were 124 times what they were in 1929. But despite the dramatic increases for both measures individually, these two numbers have grown pretty much in tandem. While corporate profits have grown faster, they haven’t grown dramatically faster. Over the eight-decade period, the ratio between corporate profits and wages -- at least prior to 2010 -- almost always hovered between .150 and .235, a pretty narrow range, all things considered.
Within this range, the ratio has regularly zigzagged up and down. The ratio has peaked during World War II, the early 1950s, the mid1960s, the mid1990s and the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.
The 2010 high broke with this history, making the statistic Reich is talking about all the more striking. And as the quarterly data shows, the spike from 2010 has continued into 2011.
This spike has its roots in basic mathematics. The ratio can rise for either of two reasons -- because corporate profits rise, or because wages stagnate. To a greater degree than in past recessions, both of these developments have happened simultaneously in 2010 and 2011. That’s the immediate reason for the ratio’s sudden increase. The ratio was well within historical norms as recently as 2009, the second year of the recession.
Today, ""indicators favorable to workers are either absolutely dreadful, like the percentage of the adult population that is employed, or else improving at a not-very-robust rate, like real compensation per hour, while indicators favorable to business owners, such as record profit levels measured in billions of current dollars, are very delightful indeed,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.
There are any number of explanations for why businesses are so reluctant to invest their profits today. For instance, Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the pattern of low corporate investment that we’re seeing today has to do with ""a climate of economic uncertainty, largely thanks to the threat of more taxes and regulations.""
But the explanation that seems to mesh best with our numbers has to do with economic cycles. While the ratio Reich points to is exaggerated today due to an unusually deep recession and an especially sluggish recovery, the general pattern follows that of other recent recessions, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Typically, businesses initially lose ground during a recession, while workers suffer somewhat less, in part due to ""sticky wages"" -- the tendency for worker pay to increase or stagnate rather than fall, even in hard times. This pattern tends to decrease the ratio of corporate profits to wages.
However, when the recovery begins, the reverse becomes true -- businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers do, since soft labor markets prevent workers from reaping the rewards of improved productivity. This pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher. Since the current recovery is particularly weak, the increase in the ratio has been even stronger than normal.
The hopeful news for workers, Foster says, is that once a recovery gathers steam and new capital-labor equilibrium is reached, workers tend to accelerate their gains.
""Once a strong recovery is under way and labor markets return to normal, total labor compensation tends to catch up, as employers bid for employees out of the extra profit margin they accumulated during the recovery,"" Foster said. ""So once we start heading toward full employment, we can expect total labor compensation to rise very rapidly relative to total income.""
So where does this leave us? On the numbers, Reich’s claim is essentially correct. And in his analysis, Reich doesn’t over-promise on what the data indicate. Amid evidence that these numbers could turn out to be a temporary spike, he resists the temptation to label it the culmination of a long-term trend.",1,Robert Reich
"""The 1990s were a time of prosperity. We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around."" With heightened fears of a recession, Bill Clinton wants you to remember the good old days, the days of Spice Girls and Starbucks and economic prosperity ... the 1990s. The days when, you know, he was president. In a radio ad that is running in South Carolina, Bill Clinton suggests things could be like that again, if you elect his wife.
""The 1990s were a time of prosperity,"" Clinton says in the ad. ""We created more than 22-million new jobs, moved 8-million people out of poverty, and turned our economy around.
""It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again. I know Hillary's the one who can do it.""
There are two main statistics in this advertisement (which Hillary Clinton has also thrown out from time to time), and we find that Bill Clinton is on target on both.
The first is about new jobs. According to Bureau of Labor statistics, the number of employees on nonagricultural payrolls went from 109.7-million in January 1993 (when Clinton took office) to 132.5-million in January 2001 (when Clinton checked out). Net gain: 22.8-million new jobs.
The other claim is fewer people living in poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people living in poverty went from 38-million in 1992 to 31-million in 2000; not quite 8-million as Bill Clinton said, but pretty close.
""The hard numbers are correct, but how much of that can you attribute to Clinton's policies?"" said James Sherk, a labor policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Keep in mind, Sherk said, the country was beginning to come out of a recession before Clinton took office. And much of the dramatic change came after 1995 when Republicans had secured control of Congress. Sherk noted that Clinton initially opposed the Welfare Reform Act, which Sherk believes may have been the biggest catalyst in reducing poverty numbers.
Sherk says Clinton was also a little lucky.
""He had the good fortune to be in office at the height of the tech bubble,"" he said. ""It makes his time in office look good in ways he can't take credit for.""
Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institute, says there's no getting around the numbers.
Sure, Burtless said, the dot.com craze may have helped the economic numbers, and some may argue that the U.S. economy was due for an up-cycle during the 1990s, ""but the fact is, there was significant economic growth during that period. It's tough to get around that.""
""To the degree that a president can effect economic progress,"" Burtless said, ""most would say Bill Clinton did well above average.""
Let the partisan folks argue about whether Bill Clinton deserves credit for the numbers, or whether Hillary Clinton can recreate them. The numbers are right.",1,Bill Clinton
"""A year ago, in March 2007, I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market, and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so."" For months, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been saying she spoke up early about the dangers of subprime mortgages and the growing problem of foreclosures.
In a speech on March 24, 2008, she said that ""a year ago, in March 2007, I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so. I warned this administration that the problems in subprime mortgages would soon spill over into regular mortgages.""
She has emphasized her early comments to show working-class families that she is in touch with their problems. We wondered if she was accurately describing the timing.
Indeed, Clinton gave a speech on March 15, 2007 to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition in which she said ""the alarm bell about the subprime home market has largely gone unnoticed by the (Bush) administration because they keep arguing we have to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy.""
She called for more borrowing options for lower income, minority and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and reforms to reduce foreclosures.
""The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,"" she said. ""It is a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families.""
Her campaign also sent us a letter she wrote in July 2006 to the chairman and ranking Democrat on a Senate appropriations subcommittee asking them to include provisions to expand the Federal Housing Administration, which she said would help provide  ""a real alternative to the sub-prime and predatory
lending market."" Her campaign said it shows she was involved in the issue early.
Sen. Barack Obama first got involved with home lending problems in February 2006 when he introduced a bill known as the STOP Fraud Act. That bill, prompted by a series in the Chicago Tribune, dealt primarily with mortgage fraud, but when he introduced the bill he noted that it ""also protects the legal rights of borrowers with risky, subprime loans. The greatest growth in the mortgage lending market is in subprime loans and some have estimated that more than 2 million homeowners with subprime mortgages are at risk of losing their homes.""
His bill did not pass.
(We should point out that in a Feb. 5, 2008 CNN interview, Clinton said she was ""the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year,"" which was not true. Her more recent comments don't make comparisons with her rivals and we're addressing the newer remarks.)
We're not going to declare who spoke up first because the crisis evolved over many months. The evidence shows both Obama and Clinton were talking about various aspects of the issue as early as 2006, before it had ripened into a crisis. But we will rule on Clinton's claim that she spoke up in March 2007.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""There have been multiple media reports about (Donald Trump's) business dealings with the mob, with the mafia."" Donald Trump ""seems terrified to release his taxes"" because they may reveal his true net worth, his donations to liberal causes, or something even seedier, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested on Meet the Press.
""There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,"" Cruz said Feb. 28. ""Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported.""
Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A Cruz spokesman forwarded us several other media reports detailing the real estate developer’s alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us.
Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career?
HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER
It’s important to note that Trump hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity, and it’s reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades.
Mob control a ‘fact of life’
Before we detail Trump’s alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all.
La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia’s control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan.
Trump and other major developers ""had to adapt to that situation"" or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime.
""That was the fact of life, that was the way it was,"" he told PolitiFact. ""The contractors and developers weren’t pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different.""
That being said, Trump’s business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let’s run through them.
Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza
Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S&A Concrete, according to  Fortune . The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony ""Fat Tony"" Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family.
Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal, admitting that S&A Concrete was ""supposedly associated with the mob.""
""Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies,"" he said, adding, ""These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings.""
When Salerno was indicted in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno’s 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings.
Trump World Tower, supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992.
TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete.
Atlantic City partnerships
Trump’s alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the Huffington Post and Philadelphia Inquirer , Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo , and mob-connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan .
Trump seemed aware of this, calling Shapiro ""a third-rate, local real estate mafia"" and Sullivan ""the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa.""
Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares.
Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, according to the Los Angeles Times .
Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the ""crown prince"" of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for $195,000 .)
According to  The Federalist , two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino.
""You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City,"" Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it, adding that ""every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that.""
A few years later, Trump’s organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad.
""Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime,"" reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump’s gambling empire.
According to gaming regulators, Leung ""flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam,"" reported the New York Daily News in 1995. ""The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges.""
Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, denied the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.)
Mob-linked business adviser
And there’s Felix Sater, ""a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections"" and the subject of the ABC story Cruz referenced.
Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a $40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families, according to the New York Times report .
From 2003 to 2007, Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump, and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel. Trump told the Times he ""never knew that.""
Three years later, Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards that described him as Trump’s ""senior advisor,"" the AP reported . Trump told the AP that he’s ""not familiar"" with Sater.",1,Ted Cruz
"In Iraq, ""civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, etc., remain very low relative to what was going on last year."" In a news conference on April 29, 2009, President Barack Obama was asked if recent violence in Iraq would affect his strategy or timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops.
Earlier in day, three car bombs killed at least 51 people in markets in Baghdad.
Obama responded by saying the recent violence should be seen in context.
""Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that although you've seen some spectacular bombings in Iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern, civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, et cetera, remain very low relative to what was going on last year, for example,"" Obama said. ""And so you haven't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time.  The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq.""
We checked with the Defense Department and other sources to see if Obama was correct about declining rates of civilian deaths and bombings. The short answer is that he is.
The number of civilian deaths and bombings in Iraq peaked during 2007, and has steadily decreased since a surge of forces was approved by President George W. Bush.
Obama specifically said civilian deaths and bombings have decreased ""relative to what was going on last year."" So we compared recent numbers with early 2008.
According to a report from the Defense Department based on information from coalition forces and the Iraqi government, civilian deaths in Iraq ranged from 600 in January 2008 up to 950 in April. The number of civilian deaths in early 2009 have been markedly lower: 270 in January, 230 in February and 260 in March.
That's dramatically lower than late 2006 and early 2007, when civilian deaths were about 3,500 a month.
As for bombings, those too hit a peak in early 2007, with about 130 in February of that year. By early 2008, they were down to 40 to 60 explosions per month.
The recent report to Congress noted that current levels of bombings were lower than at any time since the spring of 2004, but added that al-Qaida ""retains the intent and capability to carry out spectacular attacks.""
Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told PolitiFact that in addition to fewer bombings, there has been a shift in targets. At the height of violence in years past, he said, most bombings were aimed at U.S. military and Iraq military and security forces. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, markets and other ""soft targets"" in an attempt to incite sectarian violence. That suggests opposition resources are more limited than in the past, Ryder said.
The nonpartisan Brookings Institution also puts out something called the Iraq Index that keeps monthly tabs on security and reconstruction in Iraq. The detailed reports track the number of multiple-fatality bombings (more than a third of them from suicide bombings), as well as the number of people killed and wounded in those bombings. Both also back up Obama's contention. We note that Brookings bases much of its data on information from the U.S. government, but also gets information from press reports and other sources.
So information from coalition forces in Iraq, the Iraqi government and press reports all back up Obama's statement. We rule it True.",1,Barack Obama
"""John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."" The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has created an e-mail warning voters against Sen. John McCain, listing 10 things it says people might not know about him.
""Please check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers,"" the e-mail says. ""We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain — but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.""
Item No. 1 is about Martin Luther King Jr.
""John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Now he says his position has 'evolved,' yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws,"" the e-mail states.
It's true that as a congressman in 1983, McCain voted against making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday. He was on the losing end of a 338 to 90 vote in the House of Representatives.
McCain no longer stands by that vote. On April 4, 2008 — the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death — McCain said the vote was wrong in a speech he gave in Memphis, the city where King died.
""We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I myself made long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong,"" he said, to loud reaction from the crowd. ""I was wrong, and eventually realized it in time to give full support — full support — for a state holiday in my home state of Arizona. I'd remind you that we can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing, and Dr. King understood this about his fellow Americans.""
So McCain did oppose the national holiday, even though he later supported the state holiday.
As for opposing key civil rights laws, McCain scores very low from two groups that rate Congress on issues involving civil rights law.
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights rates congressmen on their voting records. For the most recent 110th Congress, it rated senators on an array of votes on such things such as immigration, voting rights, education and the judiciary. McCain scored 22 percent on his votes, voting in favor of the conference's positions twice, on immigration issues.  (Sen. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, scored 92 percent, while Sen. Barack Obama scored 100 percent. These percentages omit missed votes.)
The American Civil Liberties Union also rates McCain poorly, giving him a 17 percent rating for the 110th Congress and a 22 percent lifetime rating.
Some news stories have given a more nuanced account of McCain's history on civil rights and the black community. (See Politico's April 8, 2008, story on John McCain and Arizona's black community .",1,MoveOn.org
"""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue"" of global warming. During the second presidential debate, Sen. John McCain drew a distinction with President Bush on the issue of global warming.
""We have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet,"" McCain said when environmental issues arose during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. ""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.""
He went on to say he traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and introduced legislation on the subject of global warming.
But let's check the record – as we have in the past when McCain made similar claims on the campaign trail – and see if he was in fact at odds with Bush on global warming.
McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.""",1,John McCain
"Says ""94 percent of (Marco Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check."" Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona shooting victim Gabby Giffords, said that while ""gun control"" doesn’t poll very well, there’s ""incredible momentum"" to pass a universal background check law.
Never mind five Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who say that they’re going to filibuster any new "" Second Amendment restrictions .""
""I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check,"" Kelly told  Fox News Sunday  host Chris Wallace on March 31, 2013.
National polls this year show strong support for universal background checks, from Pew Research Center’s 85 percent to Quinnipiac University’s 92 percent .
We wondered, is it true that 94 percent of Floridians —who share their state with NRA superlobbyist Marion Hammer and a Stand Your Ground law — favor universal background checks?
The polls
We reached out to Kelly and Gifford’s advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions , but didn’t immediately hear back.
Still, we quickly found a poll supporting Kelly’s "" 94 percent "" figure.
It came from a group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayors Against Illegal Guns . The February survey of 600 voters was conducted by the polling firm of Democratic consultant Doug Schoen .
We wouldn’t call that an independent survey.
However, Quinnipiac University conducted state surveys in March. And its poll of 1,000 registered voters found 91 percent support for universal background checks.
The question: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?""
That also supports Kelly’s ""94 percent"" claim — within the Quinnipiac poll’s 3.1 percentage point margin of error.
It’s also decent evidence that Floridians are in line with the country on expanding background checks from just sales by federally licensed dealers to sales between private sellers, sometimes referred to as closing the ""gun show loophole"" or ""private seller loophole.""
Even among Florida Republicans, the Quinnipiac poll showed 87 percent support.
Rubio hasn’t been so clear.
In January, he gave an interview that made it sound like he was open to universal checks. (""I think you'll find support for that so long as there's not a public database that people can look up and see who owns what guns and where they live."")
Then his spokesman clarified he wasn’t . (""Expanding it to private sales is problematic because you are asking an individual to conduct a background check on another individual. That is expensive and hard to do, and he does not support that."")
His most recent statement doesn’t endorse background checks and opposes ""new Second Amendment restrictions.""",1,Mark Kelly
"Mitt Romney ""gave away his father's inheritance."" Mitt Romney, the self-made man.
That’s part of the ""Mitt Romney story"" that Republicans plan to tell at their convention in Tampa this week.
His father may have been well-to-do, but Republicans have been emphasizing for weeks that Romney made his millions on his own.
Romney’s father, George, was chief executive of Detroit automaker American Motors Corp. and a three-time governor of Michigan who ran for president in the 1960s. Mitt grew up in a wealthy Michigan suburb, attending prep school and ultimately Harvard.
He's been the target of silver-spoon attacks because he’s worth more than $100 million . (Perhaps far more.)
But Republicans argue he wasn’t handed his wealth — he earned it.
He even "" gave away his father’s inheritance ,"" national committee chair Reince Priebus repeatedly told TV interviewers on Aug. 26, 2012, as the party prepared to open its convention.
We’ve rated a related claim from Romney himself that he ""didn’t inherit money"" from his parents. That earned a Half True , because he previously told interviewers he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University.
This time we’re checking whether he ""gave away his father’s inheritance.""
We’re short on primary evidence for the claim — we haven’t seen his father’s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there’s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct.
Rich get richer
George Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade.
As Romney told a C-SPAN interviewer in 2006:
""I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn’t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that’s where his inheritance ended up.""
Why did he give the money away?
""I figured we had enough of our own,"" he said.
According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death.",1,Reince Priebus
"Says Florida refused to allow the insurance commissioner to ""negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high"" under Obamacare. Florida lawmakers have left the state vulnerable to unreasonably high insurance premiums in an effort to undermine Obamacare, say the state’s U.S. House Democrats.
Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature cynically stripped Florida of its ability to review rates for the law’s rollout, U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch writes in a letter signed by all 10 of the state’s Democratic representatives.
The letter, which appeals to the federal government to step in on Floridians’ behalf, blames a law Scott signed at the end of May for refusing to allow the state insurance commissioner to ""negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high.""
It asks the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to ""protect Florida consumers — since Gov. Scott, the Florida Legislature and Insurance Commissioner (Kevin) McCarty will not.""
Did the governor and state legislators prevent the insurance commissioner from negotiating lower rates and refusing high ones?
Deferring to the feds
Legislators faced a unique challenge during their 60-day session in 2013. Unlike many states that had laid groundwork to implement the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, Florida had repeatedly refused — first challenging the constitutionality of the law, then waiting to see if a new president would offer a reprieve.
But with the law upheld by the Supreme Court and President Barack Obama back in office, the state was stuck. It had refused federal money to help with the transition. Now it was also running out of time.
A state Senate committee in 2013 said it sought a ""rational, reasonable approach."" State law needed an update to match federal requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The committee sought to do as little as possible.
""We want to make sure that we're in compliance, that we're doing what we're required to do,"" said Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, at a March committee meeting.
The Affordable Care Act assumed that states would continue to take a lead role in setting insurance rates, just as Florida had done in the past. It encouraged states to strengthen their rate-setting authority, offering millions of dollars in grant money to help. But it didn’t require that.
The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation faced a serious time-crunch to get up to speed on a host of new requirements under the law. Legislators offered a compromise. If the federal government wanted to impose new coverage requirements — well, it could set rates, too.
""Since the federal government is requiring these additional coverages that will cost more,"" said Sen. Joe Negron, Republican chair of the Affordable Care Act Committee, ""then to me it makes sense for them to be responsible for approving rate increases that are certain to come.""
Democrats on the committee agreed with this approach at its final meeting on March 18 .
""I think we're going to find it's going to cost us a lot of money to set rates here in Florida,"" said Sen. Eleanor Sobel. ""... I think we should rely on the federal government.""
She expressed confidence the federal government would have a ""greater wealth of knowledge.""
""If we have concerns about the rates that the feds do set, then we should work with them,"" she said.
One hitch she didn’t mention: the federal government didn’t give itself rate-making authority.
What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842 , which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans — such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval.
Sobel now says that wasn’t at all clear at the time.
The bill earned unanimous support from the Senate Appropriations Committee, then passed the Senate 28-8 , mostly along party lines. Six senators voted after roll call, including Sobel, who changed her vote from yea to nay.
""I was reading very quickly. Then I realized this was something that was not good for the people of the state of Florida,"" she said.
The 78-36 House vote also mostly followed party lines, with a few Democratic supporters.
Gov. Scott expressed the same confidence that the federal government would step in.
When he signed the bill into law May 31, he wrote, ""I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period.""
Limits of federal authority
Here’s the thing: The federal government, even under the Affordable Care Act, can’t do what Insurance Commissioner McCarty can do.
Florida grants its insurance commissioner a range of powers. McCarty can negotiate lower rates with companies. He can refuse rates that the state determines to be too high.
The federal government can do neither of those things.
On July 31, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation released projected insurance premiums for policies that will be for sale on the new health insurance marketplaces launching in January 2014 — premiums it has no authority to review.
The state estimated rate increases in the individual market between 8 percent and 59 percent. (The federal government and consumer groups, we should note, dispute the state's projections , with one group suggesting they're inaccurately and irresponsibly high to discourage Floridians from participating in Obamacare.)
In a bulleted list, the office noted all of the ways the Affordable Care Act might be driving up costs.
It didn’t mention McCarty had no power to negotiate or refuse because of the new law.
And that matters. A Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2010 found that those states with robust authority to approve or disapprove rates were ""able to extract significant reductions.""
While Florida used the Affordable Care Act as a reason to reduce its rate oversight, most states used the law’s grants to boost theirs . North Carolina reduced a rate increase request with its new authority in 2010 that saved beneficiaries $14.5 million.
The  Palm Beach Post  noted that Maryland used its negotiating power to push rates for next year’s premiums down ""by as much as a third"" from what companies had proposed.
In the absence of oversight from Florida, the federal government does have some power to protect Florida consumers from outrageous rates — even if it can’t rescind them or otherwise impose penalties.
Chief is the new requirement that insurers must spend at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates. So, if an insurer filed for a rate increase that granted it profits far beyond the benefits it offered, it would owe consumers a rebate the next year.
Second, it could refuse to let an insurer sell its product on Florida’s federally run marketplace. But not all insurance will be sold through the marketplace. Meanwhile, the process was supposed to rely on states’ determination of whether a rate was justified.

With abortion now a key issue in the debate over health care reform, abortion rights supporters are highlighting President Barack Obama's promise about the issue during the presidential campaign.
In an alert to members on Nov. 9, 2009, Planned Parenthood Action Fund said, ""President Obama campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.""
We'll address that claim here. We'll also be adding it to our Obameter database of campaign promises.
The group's claim is virtually identical to one made in September by House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, who said in a statement that, ""during his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president.""
We researched Boehner's claim and concluded he was right about Obama's promise. We rated the statement True .
To explore Obama's promise on abortion coverage in his health care plan, you need to go back to a July 17, 2007, speech he gave to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. In that speech, he discussed his commitment to how ""reproductive care"" -- a term a campaign aide said included abortion coverage -- would fit into his health care reform plan.
Obama said, ""In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care.""
The words Obama used in that speech mirror those in the Planned Parenthood Action Fund's recent alert even more closely than they did Boehner's formulation. So it's certainly correct, as the group says, that Obama ""campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.""
It's worth nothing that since he spoke to that group -- an important constituency for someone seeking the Democratic nomination -- he has chosen his words carefully.
Of all the words Obama has spoken and written about health care reform since 2007 -- a voluminous amount, to be sure -- the terms ""abortion"" and ""reproductive health"" haven't popped up very often. Indeed, on several of the rare occasions in which Obama or his staff have broached the subject, it's been to assure Americans that his health care proposal would not promote abortions.
For instance, in his prime-time address to Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, Obama's only mention of abortion -- which came immediately after he was interrupted by the heckling Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. -- was that ""one more misunderstanding I want to clear up: Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.""
That's a reflection of the sensitivity surrounding the issue. Obama's promise to the abortion rights group during the primary campaign could now be a liability before a broader audience that includes many people opposed to abortion rights.
Still, Planned Parenthood is correct that Obama campaigned on a promise that he would put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan."" After all, he was speaking to . . . Planned Parenthood.",1,Planned Parenthood
"BREAKING: Illegal Muslim From Iran Arrested For Starting California Wildfire Facebook users recently spotted a suspicious article about the deadly Northern California wildfires, through the social network’s initiative that allows readers to flag fake news.
Given the steady flow of misleading and intentionally false claims about the cause of the fires, PolitiFact California decided to fact-check the article, which appears to have been posted Dec. 11, 2017.
It’s from the website USA In Front and includes a sensational headline:
BREAKING: ILLEGAL MUSLIM FROM IRAN ARRESTED FOR STARTING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE
The article lists ""a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam"" as ""the actual person responsible for the fire,"" citing Fox News as the source of the information. We found the network never reported that.
Before we examine the story and what appears to be its clearly false assertion, here’s some background on the destruction of the fires.
The wind-driven blazes that started Oct. 8, 2017 are the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. They killed 42 people across Northern California and destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings. Much of the damage was centered in Napa and Sonoma counties.
Our research
We started our fact-check by contacting the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the agency in charge of investigating the cause of the blazes.
Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said there have been no arrests, contradicting the claim in the article.
""All the major fires that occurred in October are still being investigated. No arrests have been made in reference to the October siege,"" McLean wrote.
We reached out to USA In Front for comment but did not hear back.
The website lists its owner as USA In Front Inc., though we were unable to find out where it is based. The site appears to allow users to create an account and submit content. It includes articles on news and politics with a right-wing bent with headlines such as ""Poll: Should Barack Obama Lose His Presidential Pension?"" to ""Meet The Most Liberal, Fiscally Irresponsible, and Pro-Death Republican in Texas.""
Article’s origin
We found the story about the arrest of a Muslim man did not start with USA In Front. In October, the fact-checking website Snopes.com , found this tale originated on a site, FreedomJunkshun , that describes its content as satire. Snopes found ""none of the details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist.""
But what started on the satirical site didn’t stay there.
The story circulated around the web, and was posted word-for-word on sites such as World Today 365 and USA In Front. Those websites presented the story as news without any mention of its satirical origin.
When we first examined the article, we noticed a few red flags: It does not have a byline, so there’s no direct way to contact the person that wrote the story. Unlike traditional, credible news articles, the story does not have a date or dateline.
Additionally, the article fails to cite any specific people as sources.
This is not the only time USA In Front has been flagged. The national PolitiFact handed out a Pants On Fire earlier this month for the site’s made-up story that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer had an affair with a teenage cheerleader.
PolitiFact maintains a list of more than 300 websites , as of November 2017, where it’s found deliberately false or fake stories. The national website describes it this way:
""This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.""
Breitbart’s false claim
The story posted on USA In Front has some parallels to a claim in a Breitbart article PolitiFact California rated False in October. Breitbart’s article said an undocumented immigrant from Mexico ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.""
In reality, an undocumented man had been arrested for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials called out Breitbart for fueling the false rumors. State fire authorities said they had not identified an arson suspect nor determined whether arson was the cause of the fires.
Breitbart’s article, or versions of it, quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report , which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News.
After fact-checkers pointed out the false claim, Breitbart added an ""update"" saying the man was not suspected of starting the deadly fires.",0,USA In Front
"""Sen. Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He lobbies for the drug companies."" Hillary Clinton highlighted an accurate inconsistency in Barack Obama's rhetoric and reality during the Democratic debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 5, 2008, three days ahead of the state's primary.
""You know, when it comes to lobbyists ... Sen. Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist,"" Clinton said. ""He lobbies for the drug companies.""
As Clinton talked, Obama shook his head no as if he disagreed. ""He was shaking his head because her implication was that it violated our lobbyist pledge and his role quite clearly does not,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said afterward. The Democrat has pledged not to take money from federal lobbyists or from federal political action committees.
The man on the hot seat is Jim Demers, a veteran New Hampshire strategist and early Obama supporter who is one of the campaign's four state co-chairs.
In the May 20, 2007, announcement of his position, the Obama campaign kept its distance, labeling Demers a ""former lobbyist"" and saying he ""will act in a VOLUNTARY role as part of the statewide team.""
And for good reason. On the campaign trail, Obama frequently assails lobbyists' influence in Washington, rejecting their campaign contributions and vowing not to let them work in his White House. (We previously found his antilobbyist policy has a few loopholes that allow him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.)
Records at the New Hampshire secretary of state's office show Demers currently is a registered lobbyist. He is president of the Demers Group, a lobbying firm based in Concord, N.H. In fact, he filed forms Dec. 28, 2007, to lobby for 20 organizations — including drugmaker Pfizer and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).
Demers, a University of Miami alum, is an experienced political player in New Hampshire. He served three terms in the state House and in 2004 was named the most influential lobbyist by PoliticsNH.com, according to biographies listed on various Web sites. Records show he is not currently a registered federal lobbyist.
Confronted by Clinton's statement, the Obama campaign once again drew a line between lobbyists who seek to influence the federal government and those like Demers who work at the state level.
""A ban on lobbying money and PACs is far from perfect,"" Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. ""There is a difference between a college football player and professional football player.""
By noting Obama's lobbyist ties, Clinton is trying to deflect the barrage of criticism she has received for taking the most money among all presidential candidates from lobbyists and the health care industry. (Claims we previously found Mostly True .)
Despite the Obama campaign's contention that there is a difference between lobbyists at the federal level and lobbyists at the state level, Clinton's charge was unspecific. It simply says Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He is.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits,"" just as there have been in the legal battle over the new health care law. During a White House interview with Tampa's WFLA-TV on Dec. 13, 2010, President Barack Obama reacted to a decision earlier that day to strike down a key portion of the health care law passed earlier this year. In the recently announced ruling , U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson of Virginia declared unconstitutional the law's requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty.
In the interview, Keith Cate, an anchor at NBC affiliate News Channel 8, asked the president for his thoughts on the ruling. Obama began by noting that other lower courts had issued more favorable rulings, and that the issue was destined to go through additional legal steps on its way to the Supreme Court.
""That's the nature of these things,"" Obama said. ""When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits.""
In this item, we'll focus on the Social Security Act, in part because we thought we'd give the president a second chance after earning a False from us on a different comment about the early history of Social Security.
It turns out that in his second historical comment, the president was accurate. Even though American society was less litigious in the 1930s, the creation of Social Security -- which is a landmark moment in the history of the federal government -- did attract not just one lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court, but three. And as we looked deeper into the history of the legal battle over Social Security, the more we noticed how much its details echo the battle playing out now over the health care law. So we'll provide an overview of the history here, in which we rely heavily on by an official history of the period written in 1999 by Social Security Administration historian Larry DeWitt.
""Even though the Social Security Act was enacted into law on August 14, 1935, the country still had to hear from the Supreme Court,"" DeWitt wrote. ""This was a new, untested area of federal authority and it was inevitable that it would be challenged in the courts, and until the Supreme Court ruled, no one could be sure that the nascent Social Security Act would survive its infancy.""
DeWitt noted that under the 10th Amendment, powers not given to the federal government are left to the states or the people, so the federal government, in its defense of the Social Security Act, would have to find justification in the Constitution for the expansion of its powers. Even before the Social Security Act was passed, other parts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- the cluster of programs designed to alleviate the Great Depression -- had been subject to legal attacks and in some cases were ruled unconstitutional by lower courts for overstepping federal powers, just as one of the requirements of the health care law has been.
In 1935 and 1936, a sharply divided Supreme Court -- split between three liberals, four conservatives and two swing votes -- invalidated the Railroad Retirement Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The defeat of three pillars of the New Deal drove Roosevelt to propose, in early 1937, an ill-fated ""court-packing"" scheme in which he would expand the number of justices, thus shifting the court's ideological complexion in his direction.
The proposal was soundly defeated by Congress, with significant collateral damage to Roosevelt's standing with the public and historians. But beginning in March 1937, one of the swing justices, Owen Roberts, shifted from the opponents' camp to become a supporter of New Deal programs, enabling a minimum wage law, the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to stand.
Three specific cases attacking Social Security reached the Supreme Court. In one, the Steward Machine Company case, the company sued over having to pay unemployment insurance tax under the law. Another case, Carmichael vs. Southern Coal & Coke Co. and Gulf States Paper, challenged a different facet of the unemployment provision having to do with the states.
But the most directly relevant for Obama's comment was Helvering vs. Davis, in which George P. Davis, a minority stockholder in an electric company, objected to being forced to pay the payroll tax that funded the old-age insurance program. The administration, represented by Internal Revenue Service commissioner Guy T. Helvering, filed suit to force compliance.
""The attorneys for Davis argued that the payroll tax was a new type of tax not listed in the Constitution's tally of taxes, and so it was unconstitutional,"" DeWitt wrote.
""At one point they even introduced into their argument the definitions of 'taxes' from dictionaries in 1788 (the year before the Constitution was ratified) to prove how earnest they were in the belief that powers not explicitly granted in 1789 could not be created in 1935. Davis was also of the view that providing for the general welfare of the aged was a power reserved to the states.""
This sounds to us a lot like some of the arguments in the health care case, which revolves around the question of whether the federal government is justified in imposing a tax-based penalty on Americans who refuse to sign up for health care coverage.
The high court handed down its decision on May 24, 1937. Reflecting a divisive debate in Congress and among the justices, the Court upheld the unemployment-insurance provision by a narrow, 5-4 vote. But in the old-age insurance, the Roosevelt administration won a resounding 7-2 victory, without even a written dissent by the dissenters.
In his majority opinion in Helvering vs. Davis, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote that the Great Depression was a national problem that demanded national solutions. ""The ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it,"" Cardozo wrote. ""Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause. The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near.""
Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Obama has a point that there are similarities between the legal battle over Social Security and the fight over the health care law.
""Like the Affordable Care Act, the Social Security Act was subject to constitutional challenges, lower courts reached conflicting conclusions, and the issue was not resolved until the cases reached the Supreme Court,"" he said. If the recent past is any guide, the court that eventually takes up the health care law, led by another Justice Roberts, will also be one with a close ideological divide.
Of course, there are limits to the comparison.
""The fact that there are all kinds of lawsuits challenging X, which was eventually upheld, obviously does not mean that every other law that is challenged by all kinds of lawsuits will also be eventually upheld,"" said Stuart Taylor, a veteran commentator on the Supreme Court.
Taylor added that while many of the broader themes are similar, the specific legal arguments are not identical. ""The issue at the heart of the health care individual mandate -- whether the government can, in the name of regulating interstate commerce, require individuals to buy a commercial product simply because they were born and they live in this country -- was raised neither by the Social Security cases nor by any other case in the nation's history,"" Taylor said. ""Also, while one can plausibly defend the individual mandate's enforcement provision as a tax in support of the general welfare, like the Social Security tax, that argument is somewhat undermined by the facts that the President and Congress strenuously denied that the mandate is a tax in order to get it passed and that the law itself was changed to call it a penalty, not a tax.""
So, Obama's comparison is not exact. But there are some striking similarities, so -- unlike in our previous item -- we think the president was justified in making the broad comparison.",1,Barack Obama
"Crimea was part of Russia ""until 1954, when it was given to the Soviet Republic of the Ukraine."" President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday.
Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States’ role should be in the conflict. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., expressed his concern of Russia’s interference in Crimea to Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace.
""I would believe that Russians would love to see the Crimea as part of the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""It was there until 1954 when it was given to the Soviet Republic of the Ukraine at the time. I think they’d like it back. It’s strategic for them militarily and economically.""
Rogers was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard Sunday from the Washington Post's David Ignatius. Not up on your Soviet history? We’ll review the facts.
Crimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It’s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent consider themselves Russian. That’s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries.
As Rogers pointed out, Crimea hasn’t always been part of Ukraine. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade.
1783: Russia annexed Crimea.
1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia.
1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War.
1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union.
1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea.
1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members’ alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s.
1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast.
1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It’s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots.
1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn’t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine.
1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement’s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042.
So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And as Rogers implied, there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea’s residents are divided on the issue of Russia’s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia’s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments.",1,Mike  Rogers
"""Now, there was a time when someone like Scalia and Ginsburg got 95-plus votes."" Sen. Lindsey Graham got a few chuckles during the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Sonia Sotomayor.
""Now, unless you have a complete meltdown, you're going to get confirmed,"" he said, adding that he didn't expect such a meltdown.
Graham, R-S.C., then went on to more philosophical ruminations about how senators decide to vote for or against nominees, citing then-Sen. Barack Obama's reasoning for voting against nominee John Roberts in 2005.
""He said something about the 5 percent of the cases that we're all driven by,"" Graham said. ""He said something to the effect, in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is applied by what is in the judge's heart. Well, I have no way of knowing what is in your heart any more than you have knowing what's in my heart. So that to me is an absurd, dangerous standard."" (Read Obama's full 2005 statement on John Roberts .)
Graham added that it used to be that nominees would be confirmed by large margins, even nominees who had established views on controversial issues.
""Now, there was a time when someone like (Antonin) Scalia and (Ruth) Ginsburg got 95-plus votes,"" Graham said. ""If you were confused about where Scalia was coming down as a judge, you shouldn't be voting, any more than if (it was) a mystery about what Justice Ginsburg was going to do in these 5 percent of the cases. That is no mystery.""
To be clear, we're not ruling on Graham's philosophy for confirming Supreme Court nominees. But we wondered if the margins were as large as Graham said for the confirmation votes of Justices Scalia and Ginsburg, who represent the conservative and liberal extremes of the court, respectively.
It turns out Graham is right. Scalia, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed by a vote of 98-0 on Sept. 17, 1986. Ginsburg, nominated by President Bill Clinton, was confirmed by a vote of 96-3 on Aug. 3, 1993. (You can browse the votes for all Supreme Court nominees on the U.S. Senate Web site.)
Graham said he didn't know how he would vote on Sotomayor, and that he would respect senators who didn't feel that they could vote in favor of her. But he also seemed to urge a return to deference for a president's nominee.
""President Obama won the election and I will respect that,"" Graham said. ""But when he was here (as a senator), he set in motion a standard, I thought, that was more about seeking the presidency than being fair to the nominee when he said, 'The critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.' Translated, that means, 'I'm not going to vote against my base, because I'm running for president.'  We've got a chance to start over. I hope we'll take that chance.""
Graham may be giving Obama too much credit (or blame) by saying Obama ""set in motion"" a standard of voting against nominees based on political leanings. Reagan appointee Robert Bork, for example, lost a 42-58 Senate confirmation vote amid much partisan rancor in 1987. Obama was then a community organizer in Chicago.
Here, though, we're checking if Graham was right that Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed by such large margins. They were.",1,Lindsey Graham
"When McCain was questioned about hiring lobbyists to his campaign staff, ""his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' "" In a speech before 15,000 people in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said that it was time to get away from ""special interest-dominated politics in Washington."" He criticized Sen. John McCain for hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his presidential campaign.
""And when called on it,"" Obama said, ""his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' I think the American people do care about it.""
Obama didn't say who he was talking about, and his campaign did not respond to clarify.
But we think Obama was referring to comments McCain campaign senior adviser Charlie Black made aboard McCain's campaign plane on May 19.
Several days prior, the McCain campaign had issued a ""conflict policy,"" which prohibits anyone paid to work for the campaign from being a registered lobbyist. Unpaid volunteers can be lobbyists, but they must list their clients and can't serve on policy committees that deal with issues in which those clients may have an interest.
The policy came on the heels of the departure of several high-level campaign officials after embarrassing disclosures about their current or former lobbying activities.
Black is himself a former lobbyist (the
Washington Post
described him as ""longtime uber lobbyist""), but he retired from his lobbying firm in March to work full time for the campaign.
According to accounts from NBC News and the
New York Times,
as reporters peppered Black with questions about the debate over former lobbyists working for the campaign, Black responded, ""This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense.""
NBC News' Carrie Dann recounted the interview with Black as follows:
""Asked today if questions about potential conflicts of interest might be affecting the choices of average American voters, Black responded bluntly: ""Hell, no."" He was careful to say that Sen. McCain is committed to maintaining the integrity of the campaign — hence his commitment to the re-vetting process. But, Black  added, 'I do not believe that average voters out there care.'""
Sure sounds like Black was saying he doesn't think the American people care about this issue.",1,Barack Obama
"If Wisconsin's governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do, ""it would still leave (workers) better off than their private sector"" counterparts. With national attention focused on a showdown in Wisconsin over Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to reduce state worker benefits, the issue led to some spirited back-and-forth between union-backer Donna Brazile and conservative columnist George Will during the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week.
Brazile called the workers who have flooded the state capitol to back union workers an ""organic movement.""
""Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, 'No more,' no more budget cuts on the back of working people."" Brazile said.
Will responded, ""Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government. Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work -- while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's all about the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to their supervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest in defense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do, would still leave them better off than their private sector"" counterparts.
We decided to check Will's claim that perks or non-wage compensation such as health and retirement benefits) -- if cut as much as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed -- would still leave public employees ""better off"" than those in the private sector.
Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of their pension contributions and to double their share of health premiums to 12.6 percent.
Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have been all over many of the issues in this contentious debate, and back on Feb. 8, they fact-checked a claim Gov. Walker made in his first ""state of the state"" address, that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums, and it would still be half the national average.
Here's some of what our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found:
* A Kaiser Family Foundation study that concluded that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. Among just state and government workers nationwide, the average was 25 percent for family coverage.
* A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey that put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage.
* A study by The Segal Co ., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers and found that a majority pay between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage.
In other words, no matter how you slice it, the 12.6 percent share of health care premiums that Walker proposes employees pay is well below what most pay in the private -- and public -- sectors.
That gets us halfway there. The second piece is pensions. Again, Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of pension contributions. This one is a little more difficult to compare. Most public employees have a pension plan. But fewer than one in five private-sector employees has access to a pension plan. And those who do typically don't contribute anything to it. Much more often, private employees have access to employer-sponsored retirement benefits (such as 401(k) plans), rather than pensions. And a third of the private sector workforce has no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan at all.
""The 401(k) has become the de facto retirement benefit in the private sector,"" said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.
Typically, Brainard said, employers will match about 3 percent to 5 percent of an employee's salary. Employees may contribute to their 401(k), but they aren't required to contribute.
So Wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector, but that doesn't mean they're at a disadvantage compared to the private sector. In fact, experts say they will be better off.
According to a survey prepared by Brainard in October 2009, ""The retirement security of working Americans presently appears shaky outside the public sector, due not only to the nation’s heavy use of a retirement plan model that has been found to be undependable in its ability to provide reliable retirement income, but also due to low relative rates of participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. ""
Conversely, ""For most states and local governments, retirement security of retired workers is a policy that is being achieved.""
As always, Brainard said, there are exceptions, such as for those government employees who don't work long enough to become vested in a pension.
But Will's comment, as it relates to pension is ""largely accurate,"" Brainard said. ""Overall, the retirement plan typically provided to Wisconsin public employees --whether or not they are contributing 5.8 percent -- provides a larger retirement benefit than private sector employees get.""
We'd like to cite one more survey, one by the Wisconsin Legislative Council which found that even among major public employee retirement systems, most required employee contributions of more than 5 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""for government workers with a required plan contribution, the average contribution is 6.3 percent of earnings."" So Walker's proposal is in line with the norm for government workers.
Now, we'd like to drop one big disclaimer into this whole analysis. Many experts contend that while state workers get better benefits, they get paid less than folks in the private sector. PolitiFact Wisconsin took a closer look at that issue here . The point is that it's important to consider an employee's total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation. But that's not the issue before us here. Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation. And with regard to the changes Walker has proposed -- requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care -- Will is right that they would still leave public employees ""better off"" than those in the private sector.",1,George Will
"""Switzerland and the Netherlands . . .  cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost."" People on both sides of the health care debate like to make comparisons with other countries. Critics of President Barack Obama's plan have warned that the United States could end up with programs similar to those in Canada and the United Kingdom, which they say have long waits and substandard care. But Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide now working as a management consultant, is citing two other countries — the Netherlands and Switzerland — as useful models for the United States because they have private insurance but still manage to provide universal coverage.

op-ed on Sept. 8, 2009, he wrote that those nations illustrate how the United States could achieve the goal of covering the uninsured without expanding direct government-run health care, such as offering a ""public option,"" an approach supported by many Democrats but opposed by many Republicans.
""The first fallacy of the 'public option or nothing' mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost — 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.""
Let's take Miller's assertions individually.
First, he's right that both countries have systems in which private companies provide the insurance. In both countries, citizens must buy health insurance from a company that must provide the customer with a basic package of services defined by the government. Subsidies are provided for people who need them. Because everyone is covered, the insurers can spread their financial risk across a large and diverse group of beneficiaries.
Companies cannot compete against each other on the basic package (and in Switzerland, any profit they make on basic services must be used to reduce premiums the following year). Instead, they can make a profit by offering supplementary packages that cover certain services such as dental care, eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery. In Switzerland, many insurers also provide life insurance or homeowners insurance.
The degree of government mandates and restrictions for private insurers in the Netherlands and Switzerland goes well beyond what is practiced by the U.S. government. But the insurers are indeed private, profit-seeking companies, as Miller said they are.
Miller's second point is that both countries have universal coverage. Yes, both require people to have health insurance (just as the Democratic bill would). In the Netherlands, for instance, the penalty for not having insurance is having to pay 130 percent of the premium during the time one is not insured. In both countries, the government can forcibly enroll uninsured citizens in a plan if they do not do so themselves. Enforcement of the law is probably not 100 percent in either country, but it's close.
Finally, Miller asserts that both nations spend less on health care than the United States does. Here, too, he is correct.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a group that analyzes statistics on wealthier, industrialized countries — the Dutch spent 9.8 percent of gross domestic product on health care in 2007, while the Swiss spent 10.8 percent and the United States spent 16 percent. So while Miller slightly overstated the percentage for Switzerland and the United States, he's close.
As for the number of uninsured Americans, the most commonly cited number is 46 million. (We looked into the validity of this number here .) The recession has almost certainly bumped that number upward, so his ""nearly 50 million"" assertion is probably pretty close.
So let's recap. Miller is correct that both the Netherlands and Switzerland achieve universal coverage through systems that use private insurers. And he's right that both countries do so more cheaply than the United States.",1,Matt Miller
"Says he followed state law and the precedent of other Massachusetts governors when he erased electronic communications as he left office. When Mitt Romney left office after four years as Massachusetts governor, his staff took their computer records with them. According to a series of articles published last month in the Boston Globe, they bought their computer hard drives and wiped the administration’s server clean of e-mails and other records.
The maneuvers have left Romney’s successor, current Gov. Deval Patrick, without any digital records from Romney’s administration, and Patrick’s staff has been unable to meet the many public records requests filed during Romney’s presidential campaign, the Globe reported.
But, in an interview last week with The Telegraph’s editorial board, Romney said his staff's actions were legal.
""In government, we should follow the law,"" Romney said in the November 20, 2011 interview.
""There has never been an administration (in Massachusetts) that has provided to the opposition research team, or to the public, electronic communications,"" he said. ""So ours would have been the first administration to have done so.""
Romney’s claims bring up two questions: Did his staff, which reportedly purchased 11 computers,  follow the state public records law? And how have past Massachusetts governors treated electronic records? PolitiFact is on the case.
First, we took a look at Massachusetts' public records law . The law, which requires state officials to preserve records for a set amount of time ,  is fairly clear about electronic records. ""The Public Records Law applies to all government records generated, received or maintained electronically, including computer records, electronic mail, video and audiotapes,"" William Galvin, Secretary of the Commonwealth, wrote in a 2009 guide to the state law .
But the Massachusetts governor’s office is not subject to these regulations, according to the state Supreme Court.
In 1997, the court issued a ruling that effectively exempts the governor’s office from the public records law's requirements. In the ruling,  Ann K. Lambert vs. Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council , the court determined that judicial nomination documents submitted to the state's governor are not public because the governor’s office is not ""explicitly included"" in the state records law.
""Were we to conclude that the public records law included the records ..., a conflict could arise between the legislation and the executive order which could impair the Governor’s ability to exercise his constitutional responsibility,"" the justices wrote.
In the years since, this decision hasn’t stopped governors from submitting records to the state archives, according to former staff members.
.
Both before and after the Lambert decision, administration staff members, including those under Romney, have submitted records to the state archives, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008.
But to her recollection, none of the former governors -- Michael Dukakis, William Weld, Paul Cellucci, Jane Swift nor Romney -- have submitted electronic records to the archives. Nor have state record-keepers received any, according to Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who oversees the public records division .
As they left office, each of the governors submitted hundreds of boxes of paper records to the records center, said Dolan, who now works at Northeastern University’s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. The only electronic records and communications that were included were when the governor's staff included printouts of some of them, she said.
McNiff, of the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office, said records submitted from the Romney administration included print-outs of electronic records.
It would be tough to track how many, but it’s ""safe to say e-mail printouts do not make up the bulk of material,"" McNiff wrote in an e-mail.
As for whether governors leave records for incoming administrations, Dolan said staff members routinely passed along some documents, both electronic and physical, which may prove valuable to the incoming governor. Some records, including those involving ongoing legislation, legal cases and gubernatorial appointments, extended into the following administration, she said, and governors, including Romney, passed those along to their successors.
But, aside from those, staffers generally cleared all staff computers of past records during the transition period, Dolan said.
""That was the routine,"" she said. ""Computers to the best of my recollection would be re-imaged and old files deleted between administrations. … You wouldn’t just start up your computer and find files waiting there.""",1,Mitt Romney
"""Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter."" A new Barack Obama campaign ad titled ""Children"" attacks Republican Mitt Romney on education by painting him as out of touch with public school students and their families.
In the ad , parents Kevin and Caroline say their children’s best experiences have been in the classroom.
""But Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter,"" a narrator interjects.
A photo of Romney appears, along with a Washington Times headline declaring ""Romney downplays value of small class size.""
Many parents have long believed that small class sizes translate into a better education for kids. School districts often boast about having low ratios, which presumably gives teachers more time to focus on each student.
Education Week, a well-respected independent journal, reports that most research supports the idea that small classes have benefits for students but that the smaller classes do not not automatically translate into better learning.
Where does Romney stand on this? We decided to check his record.
What he said
The Washington Times story cited in the ad was about Romney's May visit to a Philadelphia charter school. He joined a roundtable of teachers and talked about his approach to education while governor of Massachusetts.
""I came into office and talked to people, and said ‘What do we do to improve our schools?’ And a number of folks said, ‘Well, we need smaller classroom sizes -- that will make the biggest difference.’ So I gathered information across our state. We had 351 cities and towns. I said let’s compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students, because we test our kids, and we’ll see if there’s a relationship. And there was not.
""As a matter of fact, the school district with the smallest classrooms, Cambridge, had students in the bottom 10 percent,"" he continued. ""So just getting smaller classrooms didn’t seem to be the key.""
A teacher asked Romney for his views on class size.
He mentioned work by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute comparing class size and student performance among several countries. Romney said the study found that ""in schools that are the highest-performing in the world, their classroom sizes are about the same as in the United States. So it’s not the classroom size that’s driving the success of those school systems."" He said factors such as parent involvement, motivated teachers and quality administrators were better drivers of success.
Romney often cites McKinsey's research. His campaign pointed us to similar remarks Romney made in Orlando last September and in Nashua, N.H. in November.
""I plotted the one versus the other, classroom size against student performance. And guess what? There was no relationship at all,"" he said in Orlando.
The Obama campaign also cited his speech in The Villages, a retirement town in central Florida. Romney said Massachusetts data ""showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing.""
Finally, on page 216 of his book No Apology, Romney wrote, ""in the United States, then, the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps.""
Romney’s campaign website makes no mention of class size but touts the importance of school choice and expanding access to ""high-quality public charter schools."" His campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, pointed out that Obama’s education secretary, Arne Duncan, has also expressed skepticism about the emphasis on small classes.",1,Barack Obama
"""Again today (Ahmadinejad) made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died."" Discussing global threats and whether it's wise to directly engage Iran in talks on matters such as its nuclear program, Sen. Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly.
""I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died,"" Clinton said.
Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan.
""Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York,"" Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech  in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. ""A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed.""
Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected.
Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts.
Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran.
He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction.
On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported.
""We have two missions,"" Ahmadinejad proclaimed. ""To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world.""
Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population.
The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Gingrich supported individual health insurance mandates."" The Red, White and Blue Fund, a super PAC supporting Rick Santorum, released a TV ad in Super Tuesday primary states charging that Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are just like President Barack Obama on many core issues.
Among them: ""Like Obama, Gingrich supported individual insurance mandates.""
This attack has been leveled at Gingrich before, and we’ve found it is correct.
His comments on the subject
In 1993, when the Clinton administration was trying to pass health care reform, Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press and addressed the individual mandate.
""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance.""
He went on to criticize Clinton’s plan as ""destructively big-government."" But he also said, ""I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that.""
More recently, Gingrich joined a health care discussion with none other than Hillary Clinton in 2005 and said people should have to buy insurance or post a bond to pay for future care.
Quick comparison: An individual mandate requires people to buy insurance or pay a tax penalty. The bond idea also requires people to buy insurance, and if they don’t, to put up money to be set aside to pay for their future medical care.
Gingrich repeated his support for a bond in a 2007 column for his think tank Health Transformation.
""In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond,"" he wrote
He advocated it again in his 2009 book  Real Change: the Fight for America’s Future : ""Those who oppose the concept of insurance should be forced to post a bond to cover costs. Allowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system."" This story in The Atlantic magazine reveals audio from a conference call Gingrich participated in that was hosted by Siemens Healthcare months after Obama's inauguration.
""We believe that there should be ‘must carry’ -- that is, everybody should either have health insurance, or if you’re an absolute libertarian we would allow you to post a bond. But we would not allow people to be free riders failing to insure themselves and then showing up at the emergency room with no means of payment,"" Gingrich said.
Finally, in May of 2011, while a candidate for president, he appeared on Meet the Press and called this concept ""a variation"" on the individual mandate.
""Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care. And, I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond … or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable,"" he said.
(That remark kicked up so much controversy in Republican circles that Gingrich released a video statement the next day clarifying that he is ""completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional."")
The bond option, we learned, has been kicked around for a while.
""A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in (Mitt) Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable.""",1,"Red, White and Blue Fund"
"""I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions..."" It's not often that we hear a Republican presidential candidate crowing about support from unions.
""I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions, the international painters union as well as the machinists and aerospace workers — first time in over 100 years from either union,"" Huckabee said in a TV interview the day after Super Tuesday.
Huckabee is correct on a few points here.
Unions don't usually endorse Republican candidates, and they support Democratic candidates with contributions by margins of roughly 9 to 1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
But this year, two unions decided to endorse candidates in the primaries for both parties: The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades with 160,000 members, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with 720,000 members.
In the Democratic race, both unions endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton, and in the Republican race, both endorsed Mike Huckabee.
We called both unions and they confirmed the ""100 years"" statement because it's the first time they've endorsed Republican candidates since they formed more than 100 years ago.
James Williams, head of the International Painters, said the union decided to endorse Republicans this year as a way of reflecting the sentiments of their Republican members, who make up about 30 percent of the union. The painters mailed out a ballot to more than 160,000 members and asked them to vote in each race and Huckabee was the GOP choice.
Add to that the fact that some members live in heavily Republican areas and are represented by Republican elected officials, he said. The endorsement is a way of reaching out beyond the unions' usual Democratic allies.
""The reality is that we have to work across the aisle with both Democrats and Republicans,"" Williams said. ""It hasn't been done in the last seven years. But hopefully whoever is elected next will realize we can't have this polarization.""
Huckabee may have won the endorsements because he actively campaigned for them. He was the only Republican to attend the national convention of the machinists' union in August 2007.
He also speaks regularly on the need for fair trade agreements and the problems of working men and women. Critics and supporters alike have described him as an ""economic populist.""
Not that Huckabee's union record is flawless: Unions have criticized him for crossing picket lines of the Writers Guild of America to appear on late-night television shows, among other things.
We searched for major union endorsements of any other Republican candidates and were unable to find one. A spokesperson with the AFL-CIO said the Huckabee endorsements were the only ones they knew of.
There are a lot of unusual things about Huckabee, a bass guitar-playing, Chuck Norris-approved preacher. Add Republican and union-endorsed to that list.",1,Mike Huckabee
"""(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."" In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, the mtvU editorial board, former President Bill Clinton was asked why Sen. Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has.
""He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee,"" Bill Clinton said. ""He said one thing and did another.""
Clinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates.
All the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007.
""And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups,"" Clinton said.
Clinton is right, but some scale is in order.
According to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars.
So Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
PolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms. We have also noted that Hillary Clinton has raised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate.
Common sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries. (See our related ruling on this point here).
One question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, ""He said one thing and did another.""
But we're checking Clinton's claim that ""(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."" And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign.",1,Bill Clinton
"The White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s ""fake news awards."" On the campaign trail, Donald Trump honed his craft of slamming media organizations that covered him critically, a practice he’s carried over to the White House.
His efforts will culminate soon in the so-called ""fake news awards,"" an idea Trump first floated last November on Twitter.
""We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!"" he tweeted Nov. 27, 2017.
Trump’s idea got poor reviews from government watchdogs, who warned White House staff that the event would breach federal ethics rules designed to keep government honest and impartial.
""WARNING to White House staff: the president may be exempt from the rules at 5 CFR § 2635.701 et seq. on misuse of position BUT YOU ARE NOT. If you help @potus with the below, you risk violating §§ 702, 704 & 705 forbidding use of gov time & $$$ to harm some media & aid others,"" Norm Eisen, President Barack Obama's former ethics czar, tweeted on Jan. 7.
Experts who practiced government ethics at the highest levels told us the fake news awards could land White House staffers in hot water, for violating government rules and encroaching on the First Amendment.
Ethics rules
Eisen, now chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, referred to a set of federal regulations that lay out the ethical conduct of executive branch employees. (As Eisen noted, Trump, as president, is exempt.)
These rules are overseen by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, an executive branch agency whose 4,500 ethics officials serve as watchdogs over the executive branch to prevent (or resolve) conflicts of interest, with the aim of safeguarding governmental integrity.
Eisen specifically pointed to a section of the rules that deal with executive branch employees misusing their government jobs. The section states that an executive branch employee ""shall not use his public office for the endorsement of any product or enterprise.""
Because of that rule, the ethics office also has long considered it improper for an executive branch employee to condemn a company, said Walter Shaub, who led the OGE until his resignation in July 2017.
""You can't use your government position to endorse a company, and you can't trash a company to the advantage of a different company,"" said Shaub, who is now the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.
It's unclear if Trump’s event is being held by the White House or the Trump/Pence campaign, and neither organization replied to our questions. (Eisen's tweet — and this analysis — deals with official government events. A separate set of laws, including the Hatch Act , would apply if White House staffers participated in a campaign event, sources said.)
Would White House staffers’ participation breach ethics rules?
Absolutely, according to Shaub, who retweeted Eisen’s warning to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
""Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct. Beware of laws on using federal appropriations too, if there are any visuals, certificates, handouts, or trophies,"" Shaub tweeted Jan. 7.
Shaub told PolitiFact that a staffers' participation in an official Trump administration event designed to publicly humiliate certain media outlets would clearly constitute a misuse of their government position.
""It’s not even a close call,"" he said. ""Sending out tweets talking about how great Fox News is, which is a business, and now he’s going to give awards trashing CNN and others, which are businesses, is preferential treatment.""
No compelling government interest
Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while some ethics rules can be ambiguous, a Trump staffer's participation would be out of bounds.
""The endorsement of some news outlets and the condemnation of others crosses the line under the OGE regulations,"" he said. ""It’s hard to show where that line precisely is, but what I can tell you is it has been crossed in this instance.""
Absent some kind of serious government study showing systemic failures by certain media organizations, there’s no compelling government interest that justifies the staging of fake news awards, he said.
‘Treading really close to a First Amendment problem’
Painter said Trump’s tweets, as well as other administration actions affecting the media industry, raise First Amendment concerns. This makes it more likely an ethics official would find a staffer broke the rules by participating in Trump's fake news awards, he said.
During his time in office, scores of Trump’s tweets have followed a familiar pattern: praise for Fox News and scorn for its competitors.
On Twitter, Trump mentioned Fox News, its programs or its hosts in more than 70 tweets that describe the right-wing media outlet in positive, if not glowing, terms. Trump uses Twitter to promote Fox News reporting, highlight favorable coverage of him and his administration and lavish praise on the network while condemning their competitors.
""The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 15, 2017.
Over the same period, Trump has mentioned Fox News' rivals more than 50 times. Aside from two tweets promoting his own interview on ABC News, these tweets have ranged from negative to scathing.
""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 17, 2017.
In addition to Trump's tweets, Painter said there’s other evidence the administration has used its power to play favorites in the media industry, raising First Amendment concerns that bolster the case that the fake news awards are out of bounds.
He pointed to the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Time Warner, which has raised questions about whether this was done as retribution against CNN; Trump’s threat against NBC's license over reporting he disputed; and Trump’s repeated — and false — attacks on Amazon and its chairman Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.
Painter also noted Trump congratulated Rupert Murdoch , who co-chairs 21st Century Fox, over a deal to sell significant Fox assets to Disney, after Trump reportedly sought reassurance that Fox News wouldn’t change hands.
""There's some concrete evidence that they're playing favorites with the media organizations in official action, and penalizing those who do not give them the news coverage they like,"" Painter said. ""Couple that with the president's tweets, including several that suggest he wishes he were in a country without the First Amendment, and this is viewed as a part of a pattern of conduct.""
Both Painter and Shaub noted the ethics rules also require loyalty to the rule of law and the constitution .
""In effect the president is trying to establish official news media, establish that Fox is good and CNN is bad,"" Painter said. ""That does loop back into what's a reasonable application of the OGE rule if what you're doing is treading really close to a First Amendment problem.""
Eisen and Painter are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued Trump for violating a constitutional bar on presidents and federal officials accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments.",1,Norm Eisen
"""Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant."" On MSNBC's  Last Word  on March 22, 2011, host Lawrence O'Donnell argued that evacuation plans for nuclear power plants in the United States are an unrealistic ""fantasy"" due to the huge population concentrations around them.
That's especially the case, he said, if there were a call to evacuate a 50-mile radius -- the distance the U.S. government recently urged Americans to evacuate around an earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant.
""The truth is, most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant,"" O'Donnell said.
O'Donnell and his guest, Daniel Aldrich, author of Site Fights, used the example of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people.
Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a ""tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves.""
Said O'Donnell: ""There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point.""
The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant.
We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one.
According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported.
According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.
""They typically build power plants where there are large populations,"" said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. ""Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand.""
You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high.
So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate.
But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic.
The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, ""the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory."" In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools ""appeared to be significantly compromised.""
She's ""completely confident"" the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has ""extremely good communication with the licensees."" They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time.
""We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information,"" she said.
Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply.
While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles.
In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, ""they tend to put them in the outer suburbs,"" Milligan said.
Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic.
""Evacuations do save lives,"" Milligan said. ""They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well.""
But back to O'Donnell's statistic. He said most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. About 65 percent of the population in 2000 lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. That's certainly most.",1,Lawrence O'Donnell
"""Sen. McCain says it was not a mistake to vote against the Bush tax cuts ... but now says the tax cuts need to be made permanent."" Invoking an issue that strikes a chord with many New Hampshire voters, Mitt Romney is charging John McCain flip-flopped on tax cuts. He says McCain broke with conservative orthodoxy by voting against President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax changes.
He has made the charge in news releases, speeches and, most recently, in a new ad on his Web site. You can see it here.
Romney's charge, designed to raise questions with the GOP base about McCain's conservative credentials at a time when he is moving up in the polls, might resonate in the antitax state, which has neither a general sales tax nor a personal income tax.
We find Romney is accurately summarizing McCain's record, though he is omitting some important details.
McCain has long cultivated a reputation as a ""straight talk"" fiscal conservative, saying that tax cuts must be matched by spending cuts.
In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package that marked Bush's first big legislative achievement after initially supporting an alternative plan that had tighter spending limits. Two years later, McCain opposed $350-billion in additional tax cuts, saying he couldn't support cutting taxes in the face of unknown war costs. ""No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time,"" McCain said. ""Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq."" McCain also said he wouldn't support any spending increases that weren't related to defense or homeland security.
But in 2006, McCain voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years, saying not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering.
At the time, McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because ""American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.""
In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent.
""I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal,"" McCain said during the appearance on Hannity & Colmes. ""I saw no restraint in spending. We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today.""
Romney's charges must be giving McCain an uneasy sense of deja vu. The veteran senator is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2000 presidential race, when conservative interest groups questioned his loyalty to their causes and barraged him with negative ads.
McCain has frequently played up his fiscal conservative credentials, particularly his crusades against earmarks in spending bills and his opposition to the expensive Medicare prescription drug benefit.
He has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says.",1,Mitt Romney
"""Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada."" In a July 7, 2011, floor speech , Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered a striking statistic about how few American households pay federal income taxes.
""Let's talk about federal tax reform,"" he said, referring to suggestions that a restructuring of the tax code could emerge from bipartisan negotiations over extending the federal government’s ability to borrow money. ""There has been a lot of discussion about that, where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer and simpler.
""But right now, the fact (is) that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada. … Actually, to show how out of whack things have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits -- the Earned Income Tax Credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under the current system.""
In a sign that this is becoming a Republican talking point, Cornyn’s comments echoed those made on the floor the same day by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
So, is it true that a majority of Americans aren’t paying any federal income tax? The answer is that Cornyn is correct. And the backstory is interesting.
As Cornyn noted, his statistics come from a document produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress. The JCT found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" (not exactly ""households,"" but we’ll give Cornyn a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, JCT found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.
How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia explained it a few months ago while checking a similar claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. The main reason is that the U.S. employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well.
Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called ""tax expenditures.""
""There are lots and lots of them,"" he said. ""We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution.""
However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don’t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook.
Concern about the wisdom of providing so many tax expenditures is one of the reasons why some are calling for fundamentally restructuring the tax code, perhaps as part of the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. A tax code that included fewer specialized exemptions and deductions would enable basic tax rates to fall for all tax brackets. As an added benefit, the tax code would become simpler.
We should note that Cornyn worded his statement carefully enough to avoid potential pitfalls. Here are a few of them:
Cornyn made clear that he meant 2009. The percentage of households with no tax liability bounces around quite a bit year by year, partly due to changes in the tax code and partly due to changing economic conditions.
Figures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornyn cited -- may prove to be a high point. The center’s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011.
Cornyn took care to refer to households that pay no ""income tax,"" rather than suggesting that they paid no taxes at all. Many Americans who pay no income tax pay other federal taxes, most notably the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck.
Estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center project that for tax year 2011, 46.4 percent of households won’t have any income tax liability. However, of this number, 28.3 percent will pay payroll taxes, the center projects. Of the remaining 18.1 percent with neither income nor payroll tax liability, 10.3 percent are elderly and 6.9 percent are not elderly but have incomes lower than $20,000. In other words, all but a tiny sliver of Americans without either income tax or payroll tax liability are either elderly or poor.
Some families who pay no federal income tax may be liable for state income taxes (and local property taxes, sales taxes and the like). But Cornyn began his remarks by talking about ""federal tax reform,"" so we won't fault him for not mentioning that.
There are enough different ways to look at the tax burden to allow all sides to pick and choose tax statistics that favor their positions.
Conservatives have a point that richer Americans pay the lion’s share of federal taxes. In 2007, according to the Urban-Brookings Center , the richest 20 percent paid 68.9 percent of federal taxes, and the top 1 percent paid 28.1 percent. (One would expect the rich to pay more, since they earn more, but these percentages are even higher than their share of the nation's total income. According to one frequently cited academic study , the top 20 percent earned 61.4 percent of income in 2006 and the top 1 percent earned 21.3 percent of income that same year.)
In addition, the richest 10 percent, 5 percent and 1 percent of taxpayers each paid significantly higher effective tax rates than Americans lower on the income spectrum.
On the other hand, PolitiFact rated as Mostly True a recent statement by President Barack Obama that ""if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s."" And by international standards, the U.S. tax burden remains modest .
In other words, scoring points on tax policy depends on how you frame the issue.
So where does this leave us? A full understanding of U.S. tax policy requires a lot of additional context that Cornyn didn’t supply. Still, at PolitiFact, words matter, and on the specific point Cornyn was making -- that a majority of American households paid no income tax in 2009 -- he not only accurately cited a credible study but also took care to cite a specific year and to explain that he only meant to refer to federal income taxes.",1,John Cornyn
"""McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' "" In a radio ad airing in the heart of Harley-Davidson country, Sen. Barack Obama accuses Sen. John McCain of turning his back on American-made products.
An announcer introduces McCain telling motorcycle enthusiasts in South Dakota that he prefers the roar of Harley-Davidsons to the cheers that Obama received during a recent trip to Germany.
""Not long ago, a couple hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day,"" McCain said.
The announcer then states: ""But when it comes to his record, American-made motorcycles like Harleys don't matter to John McCain. Back in Washington, McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.'  Surprised? You shouldn't be. This is the same John McCain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship American jobs overseas. It's time to hear the roar of a strong American economy again, and stop John McCain from shipping our jobs overseas.""
Obama's campaign is broadcasting the 60-second ad in York, Pa., in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, where Harley-Davidson is headquartered. York is home to Harley's largest motorcycle manufacturing plant and played host to McCain the day the ad debuted.
In this item, we'll focus on whether McCain called a requirement for the federal government to buy American products ""disgraceful.""
Indeed he did.
McCain has repeatedly voted and spoken against requiring the government to buy American-made products. He argues that such a requirement hurts trade and doesn't guarantee the lowest prices for taxpayers.
In a 1997 article in
Defense Daily,
McCain criticized the requirement as ""the worst, most disgraceful aspect of the legislative process in Washington. I can not be more strong in my views without using four letter words. It's crazy for us, because ball bearings are made in a certain state, to somehow prevent the United States Defense Department from purchasing ball bearings if they meet quality standards from our allies.""
In 2005, he specifically mentioned motorcycles during Senate debate on a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.
""Lastly, I am also disappointed that the bill once again this year contains a department-wide 'buy America' requirement, and specific language directing the Secret Service to purchase American-made motorcycles. I firmly object to all 'buy America' restrictions, as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy.""
He added, ""Furthermore, as a fiscal conservative, I want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a 'buy American' restriction that cannot be guaranteed.""
The McCain campaign did not respond to Obama's charge. But his past words say it all. Obama's claim is True.",1,Barack Obama
"""History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth."" Some Republican critics have scoffed at President Barack Obama's pronouncements that the economy seems to be improving, pointing to the unemployment rate, which keeps going up.
But Obama has consistently tempered his hopeful words about positive economic indicators with warnings that unemployment rates are likely to continue to rise for a while, even as the economy improves.
""History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth,"" Obama said Nov. 6, 2009, in remarks in the White House Rose Garden.
""He's right about that,"" said William Beach, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's center for data analysis.
In the post-World War II era, there have been 10 recessions and after most of them, employment lagged a few months behind other improving economic indicators. But after the last two, in 1991 and 2001, unemployment rates continued to climb for more than a year.
Interestingly, Democrats criticized President George W. Bush regarding the 2001 ""jobless recovery,"" much as some Republicans now criticize Obama for the current one.
The latest jobless recovery came as little surprise to economists who study such trends.
""Employers are hesitant to hire people back to the work force (after a recession) because they don't know if the economy is going to continue to grow, which is understandable,"" Beach said.
But more importantly, he said, the American economy has become increasingly reliant on service jobs, such as information and financial jobs. ""Those jobs come back very slowly,"" Beach said.
The recession this time is even more severe, so Beach predicts this jobless recovery will last even longer than past recessions.
""I don't think we'll see jobs coming back for a long time,"" Beach said.
But even without government meddling, Beach believes employment was destined to lag.
The
San Francisco Chronicle
, relying on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August charted the lag between recessions' end and the peak of unemployment rates. In the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two, however, it took 15 months and 19 months, respectively, before unemployment rates peaked.
Bottom line, President Obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past.",1,Barack Obama
"""2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces."" Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper.
Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009.
""It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. ""Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.""
We wondered if that was true and checked the latest Pentagon statistics . Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001.
The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155.
In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet.
We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated.
The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713.
Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that).
Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations.
In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ""ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions.""
""I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan,"" Mullen said.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. ""We don't have a single adversary,"" he said. ""We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters.""
So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan.",1,Barack Obama
"""My grandfather came home from ... (World War II) exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day."" In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., presidential nominee John McCain made the case for the presidency, describing his policy positions and contrasting himself to Democratic nominee Barack Obama.
He also discussed his life story as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, and his family's long history of military service.
""When I was 5 years old, a car pulled up in front of our house,"" McCain said. ""A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.""
McCain writes extensively about the grandfather — they share the same name, John Sidney McCain — in his memoir Faith of My Fathers .
The senior McCain served in the Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II, most notably as commander of the Second Fast Carrier Force and Task Force 38. He was present at the formal signing of the Japanese surrender on the USS Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945.
In his memoir, Sen. McCain recounted that his grandfather was eager to get home after the war ended and didn't want to stay for the ceremony:
"" 'I don't give a damn about seeing the surrender,' my grandfather told (Admiral William) Halsey. 'I want to get the hell out of here.' To which Halsey replied, 'Maybe you do, but you're not going. You were commanding this task force when the war ended, and I'm making sure history gets it straight.' In his memoir, Halsey described my grandfather 'cursing and sputtering' as he returned to his flagship.""
The senior McCain returned home soon afterward to his wife in California. The day after his return, his wife hosted a small homecoming party for him.
""In the middle of the celebration my grandfather turned to my grandmother, announced that he felt ill, and then collapsed,"" McCain wrote. ""He was sixty one years old. He had fought his war and died. His Navy physician attributed his fatal heart attack to 'complete fatigue resulting from the strain of the last months of combat.' ""
His obituary ran on the front page of the New York Times , and includes the detail that he had returned home only the day before.
""Admiral McCain's groups were called the world's most powerful task force and the destruction they wrought on Japanese military installations and armament centers played a vital role in reducing the country's ability to fight and bringing about final victory,"" according to the obituary.",1,John McCain
"The ""mega-rich"" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot."" It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""
Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, "" Stop Coddling the Super-Rich ."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.
""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.
As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.
""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""
Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes . So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""
Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.
Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011 , after deductions and exemptions:
• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;
• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;
• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;
• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;
• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;
• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.
Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.
Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.
Head hurt yet? Ours, too.
Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.
Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works .) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.
Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""
He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent .
On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.
One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.
So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments.",1,Warren Buffett
"The musical Mamma Mia! has ""been selling out for years."" John McCain may not know much about culture, but he knows ABBA.
At a town hall at the Aspen Institute on Aug. 14, 2008, McCain conceded that he didn't know a lot about art and music. New York Times reporter Katharine Seelye wrote that McCain said if he's ""lacking in anything,"" it is an appreciation for music and art and ""the other great things in life,"" partly because he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war. But then the 71-year-old senator launched into a defense of the Swedish pop band ABBA.
""Everybody says, 'I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.' How come everybody goes to Mamma Mia! ?"" McCain said. ""Everybody goes! They've been selling out for years.""
We wondered if McCain was right that Mamma Mia!, the musical based on ABBA's recordings, has been ""selling out for years.""
First, we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version, which has been playing on Broadway since 2001, not the movie version, which opened this summer.
The Broadway show's Web site says the stage production, which has been performed in eight languages, has been seen by more than 30-million people in over 170 cities. The Web site calls it ""the ultimate feel-good show.""
And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts. TicketNews, which tracks Broadway receipts, reports that Mamma Mia! is still selling out. For example, it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, selling about 101 percent of its seats (the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing-room tickets). A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity.
Alfred Branch Jr., news editor of TicketNews, told us that the show is ""a virtual sellout most nights.""
So McCain is right that Mamma Mia has been selling out for years. This claim is True.",1,John McCain
"A loophole ""still exists which allows members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit 'insider' knowledge of the financial industry in order to turn personal profit."" Little-known fact: Members of Congress are exempt from rules that prevent insider trading.
Or so says the left-leaning advocacy group Public Citizen in a July 10, 2009, e-mail sent to supporters.
""The federal government has finally got the message that it’s time for stronger oversight of Wall Street and the financial services sector.  It’s also time to put an end to secret spending and insider trading,"" the e-mail reads. ""A dangerous legal loophole still exists which allows members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit 'insider' knowledge of the financial industry in order to turn personal profit.""
It goes on to describe an army of lobbyists and traders who ""haunt the halls of Congress seeking insider tips from staff — known as 'political intelligence consultants'"" who may also use the confidential information.
The e-mail asks supporters to write their representatives to support the Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, a bill sponsored by Reps. Louise Slaughter of New York and Brian Baird of Washington, that would ban insider trading by lawmakers, members of the executive branch and staff, and require that they publicly disclose stock trades of more than $1,000 within 90 days. It would also require the ""political intelligence consultants"" to register as lobbyists in both chambers of Congress.
We hadn't heard the allegation that members of Congress had a leg up for insider trading and wondered if it's true.
Thomas Newkirk, a partner with the law firm Jenner and Block, told us that indeed there's some uncertainty about how insider trading rules impact members of Congress and their staff.
For example, in 2001, a financial consultant meeting with the Treasury Department learned that the department planned to kill off the 30-year bond. In turn, the consultant tipped off traders at Goldman Sachs who proceeded to use that information to make the firm lots of money. It was considered insider trading because the consultant knew he was not supposed to release the information, Newkirk said. Federal regulators settled with Goldman Sachs and the consultant for about $10.3 million in September 2003.
But with members of Congress, it's different. Unless lawmakers have some express confidentiality agreement — whether it's in writing or in word — they can do whatever they want with the information they obtain on Capitol Hill, Newkirk said.
Bruce Carton, a former Senior Counsel with the SEC's enforcement division and current editor of
Securities Docket,
agreed there is uncertainty about the rules. ""Insider trading depends on some kind of duty. You can steal information, but unless you have some sort of duty of confidentiality to it, you're not going to be held liable,"" Carton said.
Right now, there is no duty of confidentiality for Congress, their staff or executive branch employees, he said.
""It may be unethical, and it may be unseemly, but it's not illegal,"" Carton said.
So yes, it seems there is a way for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Whether they are actually doing it is another story. So far, there are no specific examples of lawmakers engaging in ""secret spending and insider trading,"" as the e-mail indicates. But for its factual claim, we give Public Citizen a True.",1,Public Citizen
"Obama ""said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax."" Moments after the Supreme Court ruled that it was largely upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, Republicans zeroed in on the court's decision to allow the individual mandate because it is enforced through a tax.
One of the Republicans to speak out was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice presidential nominee. After the court's decision was announced on June 28, 2012, Palin tweeted , ""Obama lied to the American people. Again. He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom dies.""
We aren’t able to fact-check whether ""freedom"" is dying, which is solidly in the realm of opinion.
However, we can check her claim that Obama said the individual mandate, a requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, ""wasn't a tax."" That was the basis for the court's decision to uphold the law.
Did Obama say the individual mandate wasn’t a tax?
Given how unpopular taxes are, it’s understandable why Obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax.  But has he said it was not a tax?
We could find only one example after Obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasn’t a tax. (When we asked, the Republican National Committee couldn’t come up with any other examples, either.) The one instance came on Sept. 20, 2009, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Here’s an excerpt :
Stephanopoulos: Under this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don’t. How is that not a tax?
Obama: Well, hold on a second, George. Here — here’s what’s happening. You and I are both paying $900, on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now what I’ve said is that if you can’t afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s just piling on. If, on the other hand, we’re giving tax credits, we’ve set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool, we’ve driven down the costs, we’ve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance, but you’ve just decided, you know what, I want to take my chances. And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care, that’s…
Stephanopoulos: That may be, but it’s still a tax increase.
Obama: No. That’s not true, George. The — for us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it’s saying is, is that we’re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I’m not covering all the costs.
Stephanopoulos: But it may be fair, it may be good public policy…
Obama: No, but — but, George, you — you can’t just make up that language and decide that that’s called a tax increase. … What if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well, that’s not a tax increase; but, on the other hand, if I say that I don’t want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable, then…
Stephanopoulos: I don’t think I’m making it up. Merriam Webster’s Dictionary: Tax — ""a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes.""
Obama: George, the fact that you looked up Merriam’s Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you’re stretching a little bit right now. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition. I mean what…
Stephanopoulos: I wanted to check for myself. But your critics say it is a tax increase.
Obama: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I’m taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we’re going to have an individual mandate or not, but…
Stephanopoulos: But you reject that it’s a tax increase?
Obama: I absolutely reject that notion.
Sliced up into brief sound bites, the back-and-forth between Stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of Obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax, most obviously when he says that the mandate ""is absolutely not a tax increase.""
Still, it’s worth noting that Obama made the case that the alternative was worse -- that not having an individual mandate would be unfair and inefficient. The absence of an individual mandate, Obama argued, means passing on the costs of treating Americans uninsured to people who are insured, which amounts to a ""tax"" on those with coverage, even though it may not be literally fit the dictionary definition of a tax. In essence, Obama was brushing off complaints that he was imposing a tax by contending that a ""tax"" was already in place under the status quo.",1,Sarah Palin
"""Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue."" (Published Oct. 8, 2008)
John McCain has a well-earned reputation for bucking his own party in the Senate, most prominently on campaign finance reform and immigration.
So McCain has tried in the campaign to draw a contrast with his Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, whom McCain says always toes the Democratic party line.
McCain made the point again at the second presidential debate in Nashville. ""Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue,"" McCain said.
Limiting our examination to Obama's four years in the U.S. Senate, it would seem that McCain is on mostly solid ground, even if his claim is one that the Obama campaign hotly disputes.
The Obama campaign cites a few examples where Obama crossed up his party, including an Obama-backed effort in the Senate in 2006 and 2007 to create an independent Office of Public Integrity to investigate congressional ethics cases.
Most Democrats voted for the new office in 2006, then a small majority opposed it in 2007, so Obama hardly could be seen as one against the crowd. And our view is that the votes Obama cites on the office cannot be called a ""major issue"" since the ethics office was mostly a secondary point in a much broader fight over ethics reform that most Democrats supported. Ultimately, the Senate passed a broad bill on ethics in 2007 that did not provide for the new office.
The Obama campaign also points to a vote in February 2005 in which he sided with Republicans and a narrow minority of his caucus in favor of a bill to give federal courts jurisdiction over some class action cases. The bill was opposed by Democratic allies in the plaintiffs' bar.
But this again, was hardly a vote in which Obama stood too far apart from his caucus. Eighteen Democrats supported the bill against 26 opposed. And this wasn't an issue where Obama was particularly outspoken, so it can hardly be argued that he had ""taken on his party leaders"" on tort reform.
Finally, the Obama campaign cites Obama's 2005 vote to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, but Senate Democrats overwhelmingly favored her confirmation. The final vote among Democrats was 32 in favor of confirmation, 12 opposed.
Congressional Quarterly
each year tallies what it considers the key votes that took place in the previous 12 months. Of the 41 Senate votes tallied by
CQ
between 2005 and 2007, Obama sided with a majority of his caucus on 36 of them. On three, he did not vote. On one, he voted with 21 colleagues against the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, a vote that evenly divided the Democratic caucus. And last, there was the 2005 tort reform vote.
CQ
did not consider the Office of Public Integrity votes to be among the most important of 2006 or 2007.
None of the examples the Obama campaign provides could be seen as major issues on which Obama was at odds with his party leadership. Certainly nothing on the scale of McCain's unpopular positions on immigration and campaign finance reform, among others. McCain speaks in absolutes — Obama has ""never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue"" — but the record supports him. We say McCain's claim is True.",1,John McCain
"Taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco. What do you do when you're a Republican running an uphill, some would say quixotic, campaign against Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in historically liberal San Francisco?
Trailing badly in the polls, John Dennis appears to be trying to raise his profile via the viral campaign video route.
Dennis has introduced a Wizard of Oz-themed ad , with Pelosi, of course, cast in the role of the Wicked Witch of the West.
""I will save you from those evil Republicans,"" the Pelosi character cackles. ""But first, pay $18,000 a month for my downtown office.""
She then talks about running up the debt and summons her ""monkeys"" (sporting IRS tags) ""to make you pay for it all.""
Cue Dennis.
""Step back everyone,"" says Dennis, appearing in the frame. He pours a bucket of water (labeled ""Freedom"" -- we're not making this up) and melts the witch.
Hokey? You bet. But with 500,000 hits in its first few days online, we'd say, mission accomplished.
None of the actors is likely to get much Oscar buzz, but we're not here to review the ad's artistic merits.
We'll stick to a fact-check of the claim that taxpayers are on the hook for $18,000 a month for Pelosi's downtown San Francisco district office.
The rent for Pelosi's district office is actually $18,736 a month, as first reported in June 2010 in a Roll Call analysis of a database assembled by the Sunlight Foundation. Pelosi moved into the 3,075 square foot space in the new, 18-story federal building in downtown San Francisco in the fall of 2009. It was a significant upgrade, more than quadrupling the rent she paid for her previous district office, and is nearly double the next-highest rental paid by a member of the House.
According to the Roll Call analysis, the next highest monthly office rent, $10,600, belongs to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district office is in a federal building in Manhattan. Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano (Bronx, N.Y.), Doris Matsui (Sacramento) Stephen Lynch (Boston) and Diane Watson (Los Angeles) all pay $9,000 to $10,000 a month for district offices.
This rental data comes courtesy of Pelosi, who allowed the release of the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November 2009.
Drew Hammill, Pelosi's press secretary, said the decision to move last fall was justified because after 20 years, ""the old office was no longer able to meet the needs of San Franciscans in the existing space and the new office will expand office size by nearly a third, allowing better service for San Francisco constituents.""
The office is more centrally located, Hammill said, allowing constituents better access via public transportation.
Better security was also a priority, he said.
""In the role as speaker of the House, the new federal building offers enhanced security features, a major factor in the decision to move offices,"" Hammill said.
""This move did not come without additional expense,"" Hammill said. ""As every San Franciscan knows, the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the county and, of course, office space rents are among the highest, on average, in the country.""
Hammill also noted that the rent is being paid back to the federal government, which owns the building, and that Pelosi pays the same cost per square foot as any other federal agency that is a tenant of the building.
By way of context, Roll Call reporter Paul Singer noted in his report that serving as speaker carries additional cost and that previous speakers have paid substantially more for their district offices than other nearby members of Congress.
One other piece of context is warranted. The expense for district office rent is paid out of set amount allotted to members called the Members' Representational Allowances (which typically range from about $1.4 million to $1.7 million for each office). Out of this account, members pay for their staff, travel, office rent, office art, flowers, bottles of water etc. The amount of the allowance varies based on factors such as the distance of a member's district to D.C. and the relative cost of office space in the member's home district. Pelosi's allowance is higher due to the travel distance to California and the high rents charged in San Francisco. In addition, because of the additional responsibilities, the speaker gets a higher allowance.
Members can decide for themselves how to spend their allowances. And Pelosi did not exceed hers. So one could argue that while Pelosi decided to prioritize spending for her office space, it didn't cost taxpayers any more, that she simply had less to spend on other things. Members can give back the unused part of their allowance, but in practice, very few ever do. They simply find other ways to spend it.
We're not going to weigh in on whether Pelosi's rent is justified. But the ad says the American public pays $18,000 a month for Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco, and its $18,736.",1,John Dennis
"""John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for... the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government."" Sen.  Barack Obama has battered Sen. John McCain throughout the campaign for his ties to Washington lobbyists, arguing that McCain's lobbyist allies have influenced his policy positions.
After Russia invaded Georgia on Aug. 8, Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan let loose another such accusation: ""John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government.""
McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has lobbied for Georgia. Scheunemann, a former national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leaders Trent Lott of Mississippi and Bob Dole of Kansas in the 1990s, signed a March 2004 contract — on file at the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act office — indicating that Scheunemann and his firm, Orion Strategies, would assist Georgia in gaining membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in exchange for $150,000 for a year's work. That goal has yet to be achieved — Russia vehemently opposes Georgia's inclusion — so Georgia has renewed the contract several times, most recently in May of this year, at a cost of $200,000 through the end of 2008.
Scheunemann took a leave of absence from Orion Strategies earlier this year but it's probably fair to say that he remains invested in his firm, a two-person shop he started in 2001 with Mike Mitchell, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and to which he could easily return if McCain loses the presidency. Mitchell continues to handle the Georgia account.
It's clear, too, that McCain has ""mirrored the position advocated by the government"" of Georgia, at least so far. McCain sponsored a nonbinding resolution that the Senate passed unanimously in December 2005 urging the United States to increase its efforts in support of the peaceful reincorporation of South Ossetia into Georgia. The resolution also commended the government of Georgia for devising a peace plan to ""control peacefully and re-establish authority"" in the separatist region.
What's cloudier, indeed, is whether McCain's view of the Russian invasion differs substantially from Obama's.
Reporters tried to pick apart the candidates' initial statements after Russian forces moved into Georgia on Aug. 8. A
New York Times
report, for example, argued that McCain's first statement was ""immediate and tough,"" since McCain's statement blamed Russia for crossing an  ""internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia"" while demanding that Russia ""unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces.""
That mirrored what Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had said Aug. 9, when he said Russia had launched a full-scale invasion and offered an immediate cease-fire.
Obama, the
New York Times
said, ""trod more carefully,"" not blaming Russia at first. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that his country had been provoked by Georgia's assault on South Ossetia, an autonomous, ethnically Russian region of Georgia.
But as Russia continued its invasion into Georgian territory on Aug. 11, Obama moved toward McCain's position. ""No matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and invaded another country,"" he said. ""There is no possible justification for these attacks.""
McCain and Obama have both now issued statements supporting Georgia's entry into NATO.
There's no evidence that Scheunemann's ties to Georgia have influenced McCain's position, but it is correct to say McCain has supported the view of the Georgia government. The Obama campaign's statement about Scheunemann and McCain is True.",1,Barack Obama
"Health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits. The White House is fighting chain e-mails with chain e-mails.
After spending days responding to inaccurate e-mails about the health care reform plan, the White House responded with its own e-mail from David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. The subject line was ""Something worth forwarding.""
""This is probably one of the longest e-mails I’ve ever sent, but it could be the most important,"" Axelrod wrote. ""Across the country we are seeing vigorous debate about health insurance reform. Unfortunately, some of the old tactics we know so well are back — even the viral e-mails that fly unchecked and under the radar, spreading all sorts of lies and distortions.”
One such distortion, Axelrod said, is the suggestion that veterans' access to health care will be blocked by the bill. ""It’s a myth that health insurance reform will affect veterans' access to the care they get now,"" Axelrod wrote. ""To the contrary, the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded. The VA health care system will continue to be available for all eligible veterans.""
The White House has also posted a video about the issue on its Web site.
The rumor may have started when a coalition of six veterans groups wrote a letter on July 30, 2009, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing concern that the bill might penalize vets who get health coverage through the VA but don't have private health insurance.
The House version of the bill mandates coverage by requiring individuals to have a health insurance plan or pay a penalty based on their income. And businesses would have to contribute 65 percent of workers' family insurance premiums or pay an 8 percent penalty.
""We wanted to make sure that, if someone is enrolled with the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], they didn't fall into this category"" of having to pay a fine because they didn't have private coverage, said David Autry, a spokesman for the Disabled American Veterans.
""Businesses might have been less willing to hire vets who may be enrolled in the VA health care plan,"" said Tom Zampieri, director of government relations for the Blinded Veterans Association.
Those concerns have since been addressed through a series of amendments to the House bill, according to Zampieri and Autry.
Nothing in the House bill would affect veterans' current coverage, they both said. Vets will continue to get those services from the VA.
""What the White House is saying is true,"" said Bernard Edelman, deputy director for policy and government affairs for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
Edelman said that another part of the White House claim – that “the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded” – also adds up. Obama’s first budget plan opened the VA’s doors to about that many vets previously excluded from care.
So, by all accounts, the administration is correct that health care reform will not keep veterans from getting the care they currently receive. So for this one, Axelrod earns a True.",1,David Axelrod
"Palin supports ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife."" Produced by the political arm of the Defenders of Wildlife Action, a new television ad takes aim at Sarah Palin’s position on wildlife issues. The minute-long video starts by juxtaposing Palin’s darkened picture with majestic images of a bear and a wolf, while an announcer talks about her support for an aerial predator-control program.
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
The ad shows grisly video footage: low-flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air. The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill. In one picture, a wolf’s carcass hangs from one of the plane’s wing braces.
For this item, we'll focus on the claim that Palin promotes ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife.""
Palin’s record on the issue is actually quite clear. As a candidate, and as governor, the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations.
But in Alaska, frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48. Alaska has vast populations of wolves, bears, caribou and moose, and sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species.
“If I am elected, I don’t want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou,” Palin said, according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006.
Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase “aerial hunting,” preferring “aerial shooting.”
“The predator-control program that we do — that isn’t hunting and we never claimed it is,” said Tim Barry, spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. “It deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage. That’s what we want.”
It’s tougher to assess the ad’s subjective assessment that such practices are “brutal and unethical,” though many wildlife groups would agree. Defenders of Wildlife has filed lawsuits challenging Alaska’s wildlife management practices. President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals, outside of a biological emergency, is unwarranted. In September 2007, more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the state’s intensive predator management.
Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska, which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important.
The ad is missing an important note of context. Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller, Alaska officials count between 7,000 and 11,000 in the state. Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov. Frank Murkowski.
In 2007, Palin’s administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the state’s goal for the year. Palin’s office announced a plan to pay hunters $150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists. The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife.
“I have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance, and to a proactive, science-based predator management program where appropriate,” the governor said in a news release at the time.",1,Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund
"""John McCain voted against funding the troops because of . . . a timeline in it to draw down American troops."" UPDATED: We updated this item on Oct. 6 and changed the ruling to True. See explanation at end.
During an exchange with Sarah Palin in the St. Louis vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Joe Biden tried to rebut a charge that Barack Obama had failed to ""fund the troops"" in Iraq by saying John McCain had done the same thing on a different bill.
Palin began the exchange by saying that ""Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops.""
Biden replied that Obama had offered a withdrawal plan that would shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months and would draw down U.S. combat troops. As for the allegation about failing to fund the troops, Biden said, ""John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline.""
Republicans candidates have charged that Obama ""failed to fund the troops"" because of his May 24, 2007, vote against an appropriations bill that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (It passed, 80-14.)
We addressed that charge in this item and found it was misleading to say Obama did not want to fund the troops. We noted that Obama's primary reason was that the bill lacked a timetable for withdrawal. “We must fund our troops,"" he said at the time. ""But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.”
Biden's rebuttal in the vice presidential debate seems to be a reference to a war spending bill that first passed the Senate in March 2007. When Biden refers to an ""amendment,"" we believe he was referring to the provision that would require a withdrawal of troops. And Biden is correct that McCain voted against the bill when it included that requirement.
The bill, H.R. 1591 , included $97 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and set a goal to withdraw most U.S. troops in Iraq by 2008. It passed 51-47 but was opposed by most Republicans because of its timetable for withdrawal.
McCain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq.
""Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad.  For these reasons, I do not support this bill,"" McCain said at the time. (The bill passed but was vetoed by President Bush.)
Biden is right that McCain opposed a war spending bill.",1,Joe Biden
"""Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years,"" a campaign spokesman said. The campaign of Sen. Hillary Clinton recently trotted out quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove that he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. Seriously.
The conflict between the top Democrats running for president began when Obama said this: ""I have not been planning to run for president for however number of years some of the other candidates have been planning for.""
The Clinton campaign responded with a thoroughly researched news release that culled details from Obama's life that had been reported in feature articles about him.
""Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years,"" the Clinton news release said. ""So who's not telling the truth, them or him?""
The evidence:
• Former classmates who said that when he was at Harvard Law School, Obama was ""thinking about politics.""
• A brother-in-law saying Obama told him in the early 1990s that he was interested in a run for president.
• An essay Obama wrote in third grade called, ""I want to be a president.""
• An essay he wrote in kindergarten called, ""I Want To Become President.""
PolitiFact set out to confirm those sources.
Brad Berenson, a classmate and friend of Obama's at Harvard Law School in the early 1990s, said: ""I certainly never heard him say directly or indirectly that he wanted to be president of the United States. That kind of sentiment would have been absurdly presumptuous at that point.""
Now, Obama spent some of his early years in Indonesia, including kindergarten and third grade. We started to track down those teachers living on the other side of the world, but then we realized this goose chase wasn't worth the effort. The Obama campaign is not denying the accuracy of the Clinton reports.
Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, says there's no doubt the Clinton campaign has some facts on its side.
""The overall thematic attack that he is out there saying that he is somehow different from someone else in the field, that he is somehow propelled into this race … I think that's absolutely fair game for the Clinton camp to go after,"" said Dunn, a Democratic strategist not aligned with a candidate, but who worked as a consultant to Obama's Hopefund PAC for six months in 2006. ""On the other hand, were they wise in the example they used?""
It does appear that Obama expressed ambition for the office of president many years ago. We wish we had a ruling category called ""True, but ridiculous."" We don't, so we're left with True.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""NATO hasn't provided enough troops (in Afghanistan) because they are still angry about us going into Iraq."" During the Q&A portion of a town hall meeting in Cape Girardeau, Miss., on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the need to focus on and provide more troops in Afghanistan.
""If we're going to catch (Osama) bin Laden, or most importantly, break down al-Qaida ... we've got to have the capacity to put more troops in Afghanistan ... both our troops and NATO troops.
""Right now, we don't have enough troops and NATO hasn't provided enough troops because they are still angry about us going into Iraq.""
With the addition of some 7,500 Marines in Afghanistan in early 2008, there are now about 32,500 American troops in Afghanistan; plus an additional 28,000 NATO troops.
Late in 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made several public, but largely fruitless, pleas to NATO countries for the commitment of more troops in Afghanistan.
A Congressional Research Service report for Congress, submitted Jan. 7, 2008, states that Gates ""acknowledged that domestic political problems are preventing some allies from increasing their force levels in Afghanistan. Allied government officials state privately that their populations are reluctant to follow the Bush Administration, largely due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and subsequent criticism of the United States in Europe and the Middle East.""
Later, the report cites a ""highly respected"" German Marshall Fund poll that found a sharp decline in European public opinion toward U.S. leadership due to the U.S. policy in the Iraq war.
The report concludes that, ""This decline is complicating the effort of allied governments to sustain support for the ... mission"" in Afghanistan.
Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, said there is some truth in Obama's statement.
""The Iraq war has soured many European electorates on U.S. foreign policy,"" Kupchan said. ""Even though there was a groundswell of support for the war in Afghanistan, there is a certain amount of skittishness about Bush and his foreign policy.""
That creates a situation where the United States is finding it more difficult to garner support for more NATO troops. But that's not the only reason, he said. There is a widespread belief that the United States has not balanced the use of force in Iraq with reconstruction and assistance.
There is a feeling, he said, that the United States has ""overmilitarized"" the Iraq war, Kupchan said, that there are too many civilian casualties, ""that we are dropping too many bombs and not winning over as many hearts and minds.""
Many NATO countries also are uncomfortable with involvement in a war thousands of miles away.
""I think it (Obama's comment) is fair as long as one realizes that's one of several factors when looking at the shortfall of NATO contributions,"" Kupchan said. ""It is one of several issues in play.""
The British House of Commons' Defence Committee, in a report on British operations in Afghanistan, warned last summer that troop shortages in Afghanistan threatened to undermine the campaign, and that the size of NATO forces should be considerably greater.
So Obama is on solid footing when he says more troops are needed in Afghanistan. In a Pentagon news briefing in July 2007, Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said as much, calling the international military mission ""under-resourced.""
And even a U.S. government report concluded that European criticism of the U.S. war in Iraq has made some NATO countries less willing to commit troops to Afghanistan. While some NATO experts say that is not the only reason, they agree it is a big one.",1,Barack Obama
"""He won't even support his colleague's ... motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps."" Longtime consumer advocate and independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, seeking to attract voters to the left of Sen. Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush.
""He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps,"" Nader said in a June 18 interview on the radio program Democracy Now! ""He  — you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well.""
Feingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a resolution to censure Bush in March 2006, three months after the
New York Times
reported that the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants.
Censure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president — Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure.
Feingold's proposal was to ""condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.""
Republicans immediately attacked the measure, and many Democrats distanced themselves from it, including the senator and future presidential candidate from Illinois.
""It's not impeachment, but it's not something you apply lightly,"" Obama told the
Chicago Tribune
at the time. ""And whether we want to start applying censure motions or impeachment when there are questions about a president's authority in national security is something that you have to be judicious about.""
Only three senators — Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John Kerry, D-Mass. — have co-sponsored Feingold's resolution. It has not moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Obama campaign did not respond to requests to clarify his position on this censure proposal. His past comments and his decision not to co-sponsor Feingold's resolution lead us to conclude Nader was correct in saying Obama does not support it.",1,Ralph Nader
"Obama has ""visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office."" We got a chain e-mail recently that purports to list 90 accomplishments from President Barack Obama's first six months in office.
Unlike most chain e-mails we check out, this one was signed by its author, Robert Watson, a professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Watson said he spoke last spring at some Democratic political clubs and was asked by some members to compile the list as talking points to balance some of the claims about the Obama administration coming from Republicans. The list has since gone viral, and now Watson fields several calls and e-mails every day challenging some of the entries.
We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out.
Here, we look at No. 34, that Obama has ""visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office.""
In the first six calendar months of his presidency, Obama did far more international travel than his previous five predecessors, according to an analysis by Brendan Doherty, an assistant professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy, for the White House Transition Project. In all, the study found, Obama traveled to 13 countries in his first six months in office. That's far more than George W. Bush, seven in 2001; Bill Clinton, one in 1993; George H.W. Bush, nine in 1989; Ronald Reagan, one in 1981; and Jimmy Carter, two in 1977.
Obama has also met with more heads of state. According to Doherty's analysis, seven of Obama’s 13 stops were bilateral visits with the head of state of another country; while 15 of the 20 journeys made by Obama's five predecessors combined were bilateral meetings with other heads of state.
""Examination of the first six months of President Barack Obama’s international and domestic travel reveals an active chief executive,"" Doherty concluded. ""His record-setting pace of travel abroad reflects the many international challenges facing the United States at the beginning of his administration.""
The U.S. Department of State posts historical data on presidential travel abroad, which allowed us to look back even further, to the 13 presidents before Carter, all the way back to Theodore Roosevelt. None come even close to Obama's international travel record for the first six months.
According to a Nov. 11, 2009 story by CBS News' Mark Knoller, who keeps meticulous records on presidential travel, Obama has traveled abroad more in his first year in office than any other president in history, and the year isn't even finished yet. According to Knoller's story, ""Foreign travel by American presidents is a relatively new practice. No sitting U.S. president left the country until Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. He made a single foreign outing: a three-day visit to Panama in November of that year to inspect construction of the Panama Canal.""
Including his most recent Asia trip, Knoller notes that Obama has taken eight foreign trips to 20 countries.
Make what you will of Obama's globe-trotting, Watson's e-mail is correct that Obama has visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office.",1,Chain email
"""Gov. Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act."" Since President Barack Obama announced a new policy to suspend deportations for some young illegal immigrants, his campaign has been touting that policy and putting down his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.
Obama adviser David Plouffe answered a question on Fox News Sunday on June 17, 2012, about why Hispanics should vote for Obama.
""So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants, and that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that,"" Plouffe said. ""Gov. Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Gov. Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport. So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust.""
We wanted to know if Romney specifically said he would veto the DREAM Act because we often find distortions when one campaign describes its opponent’s position.
A little background: The DREAM Act is the federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, a bill proposed several times over the years but never passed.
Generally speaking, it pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or in the military, they would be allowed to move to a legal status and not be deported. The idea has been around since at least 2001 , when a bipartisan bill was introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, though details of the bills have varied over the years.
We should also note that the term ""DREAM Act"" has been applied to some state legislation that gives in-state tuition to young illegal immigrants who had been long-time state residents.
In the context of this fact-check, though, the most applicable legislation is the federal DREAM Act of 2010 . The bill wasn’t able to win the 60 votes needed for a full consideration, failing a cloture vote on Dec. 18, 2010.
We went back to the archives of the Republican primary and soon found what Romney had to say about the DREAM Act. (We contacted the Romney campaign but didn’t hear back.)
In 2011, the DREAM Act and other immigration issues were hotly debated topics in the Republican primary. Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration and attacked his primary opponents Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry on the issue.
When asked about the DREAM Act in 2011, Romney said he would veto it, but he also said he supported part of the DREAM Act -- the part that allowed people who had served in the military to achieve legal status.
Here’s Romney's answer to a voter on Dec. 31, 2011, in Le Mars, Iowa, who asked if he would veto the DREAM Act if Congress passed it:
""The answer is yes. I’m delighted with the idea that people who come to this country and wish to serve in the military can be given a path to become permanent residents in this country. Those who serve in our military and fulfill those requirements, I respect and acknowledge that path. For those that come here illegally, the idea of giving them in-state tuition credits or other special benefits I find to be the contrary to the idea of a nation of law. If I’m the president of the United States I want to end illegal immigration so that we can protect legal immigration. I like legal immigration.""
(We should note that the DREAM Act did not automatically award in-state tuition to anyone, though some states have those laws on the books.)
Romney recently repeated support for the military portion of the DREAM Act in remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando on June 21, 2012.
However, Romney declined to say whether he would renew the executive policy of Obama.
""Some people have asked if I will let stand the president's executive order. The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure,"" he said.
He also criticized Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform when there were Democratic majorities in the Congress:
""For two years, this president had huge majorities in the House and Senate – he was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system. Nothing. Instead, he failed to act until facing a tough re-election and trying to secure your vote. … I think you deserve better.""",1,David Plouffe
"""Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close."" President Barack Obama said a budget proposed by House Republicans lacked ""a shred of credibility,"" especially when it came to tax cuts.
Obama said their budget includes $4.6 trillion in lower taxes over the next 10 years, with no way to pay for them.
""We’re told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions,"" Obama said. ""But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close. Not one.""
We wanted to check Obama’s claim that Republicans in Congress ""refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close.""
But first, a little explanation about the House Republicans’ budget. Its top advocate is Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and chairman of the House Budget Committee.
When it comes to taxes, the idea behind the House Republican budget is to keep overall tax revenues about where they would be under current policies. (We use the word ""policies"" on purpose -- keep in mind that under current law, today’s rates will expire at the end of the year and climb higher in 2013.)
The House Republicans envision dramatically different income tax rates, though. Instead of today’s six income tax brackets -- 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent -- they would use just two brackets, 10 percent and 25 percent.
Clearly, this would represent a big rate reduction for people in the top brackets. To keep tax revenues from taking a nosedive, House Republicans say they will end current exemptions and deductions, which both they and Obama refer to as ""loopholes.""
In principle, it’s certainly possible to eliminate exemptions and lower tax rates while keeping tax revenues the same. It’s usually called ""broadening the base"", and it was part of the 2010 Simpson Bowles budget commission that Obama has praised, though he’s stopped short of endorsing the bipartisan commission’s recommendations.
The point Obama made, though, was that the House Republicans haven’t said which exemptions they would end. Some of the largest exemptions are the most popular, such as tax exemptions on employer-provided health insurance, home mortgage interest and charitable donations, as well as special lower tax rates for income from investments, such as capital gains and dividends.
We found Obama’s charge is largely correct -- the House budget doesn’t specify which exemptions it would end. The website of the House Budget Committee defers the matter to the House Ways and Means Committee, which is traditionally charged with tax legislation.
Committee staff pointed us to this statement on the House Budget Committee website:
""This budget calls for lowering tax rates and broadening the tax base. All corners of the tax code should be on the table. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, has held dozens of hearings over the past year examining how best to simplify the tax code while maximizing economic growth.""
That doesn't entirely let House Republicans off the hook, though.
The Tax Policy Center, a respected independent think tank that specializes in analyzing the tax plans of politicians, found that without curtailing exemptions, the overall tax policies in the House Republicans’ budget would add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.
""Ryan argues that eliminating or scaling back deductions, credits, and exclusions ought to be part of the GOP fiscal plan. But he won’t say how,"" said Howard Gleckman, writing for the center’s blog TaxVox . ""Cuts in those tax preferences could make a big difference in determining who wins and who loses from the tax portion of his budget. But until House Republicans describe which they’d cut, there is no way to estimate what those base-broadeners would mean.""
Ryan himself was put on the spot recently by Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace. After some back and forth, Ryan suggested that he would favor targeting elimination of exemptions for higher income taxpayers. Here’s the exchange :
Wallace: ""All right. I understand, this is not your committee, it's the Ways and Means Committee. Can you tell me any (tax exemptions) that you're willing to say, do away with it?""
Ryan: ""What I would say on doing away with it, is who would we do away with it for. And what we're saying is the people who disproportionately use those, it's the top two tax rate payers use almost of those tax expenditures. We would limit these things to those higher income earners.""
Wallace: ""Even things like the deduction for health insurance and pensions and home mortgage?""
Ryan: ""Yes, right. Instead of giving these write-offs to the people in the top tax bracket, take those tax shelters away. For every dollar that's parked in the tax shelter is taxed at zero. Take away the tax shelter, subject all of their income to taxation, you get more revenue, and we can lower everybody's tax rate in return. So, we're saying let's limit these kinds of deductions to the higher-income earners so that everybody can enjoy lower, flatter tax rates in return.""",1,Barack Obama
"""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago."" A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.
The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.
""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,"" the narrator says.
The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.
""Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.""
With images such as a newspaper headline that says ""McCain climate views clash with GOP,"" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.
Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.""",1,John McCain
"The omnibus spending bill has ""9,427 pork barrel items."" Despite all the talk during the campaign about cutting earmarks, Congress is still packing them into appropriations bills.
Case in point: the big appropriations bill for 2009 that never got passed last fall and is now before Congress. It's an amalgamation of nine spending bills known on Capitol Hill as the Omnibus.
Members of Congress have talked a lot about cutting earmarks, the provisions that specify money for pet projects, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Omnibus. On CNN's
American Morning
on Feb. 25, Sen. John McCain complained that the bill was packed with them.
""On the floor tomorrow or the next day of the Senate will be a bill with 9,427 pork barrel items,"" McCain said, noting that one provision would provide $2 million to promote astronomy in Hawaii.
Other Republicans have made similar claims. ""There are nine appropriations bills that [Democrats] are going to wrap together that are $30 billion over budget in a bill that contains 9,000 earmarks. This is absolutely crazy,"" Rep. John Boehner, the House Majority Leader, said in a Web video .
We wondered if their numbers were right.
We should start by noting that there are differences in how groups define an earmark, something we explained when we checked the White House claim that there were none in the economic stimulus package. The House, Senate and the executive branch have different definitions, while we prefer the one in
Safire's Political Dictionary
that defines an earmark as money  ""that individual senators or representatives specify be directed to projects and activities that will benefit particular people, institutions or locations in their home constituencies.""
McCain's office told us the 9,427 was a ""preliminary number"" that staffers got by simply counting member-sponsored projects in a draft of the House version of the bill.
Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that tracks federal spending, has a slightly lower number — 8,570 (down from 8,811 last year). That number includes anything defined by Congress as an earmark that doesn't mention the president as the person making the request. If you also include items requested by the president's budget that have been jointly requested by a member of Congress, the number comes to 9,287, according to TCS.
A McClatchy News Service story put the total earmarks at 9,000, attributing it to ""congressional officials.""
So McCain's number is in the same range as other counts and given slightly different definitions, it's possible to get different tallies.",1,John McCain
"""A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration."" In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich.
She said the federal government ""is not taking the steps necessary to protect us"" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example:
""A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years.""
To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel (""a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown"") and vinegar pickle (""sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5""). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction.
We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies.
In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. ""There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody,"" he said. ""It defies logic.""
He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, ""it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing.""
Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.)
To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel
The Jungle
, which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight ""from the hoof to the can.""
Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold.
But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. ""There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.,"" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public.""
Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is ""really starving for resources.""
Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance.
""The nation's food supply is at risk,"" the report said.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Obama said his proposed $1,000 emergency energy rebate ""will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next 4 months."" In a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Aug. 1, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama announced a proposal for a two-part emergency plan ""to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track.""
One part is a $50-billion stimulus package that would be split: $25-billion to go to state governments facing big budget shortfalls; and $25-billion toward national infrastructure projects like highways and bridges.
The other part of his emergency plan is a $1,000 energy rebate that he said ""could go out to families as soon as this fall.""
""This rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. Or, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. Or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt.""
Obama said he plans to pay for the rebate by taxing windfall profits of oil companies.
We decided to check Obama's math, to see if his numbers were right about how far $1,000 would go this winter.
First up, the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. According to Energy Department figures for the latest available year, 2001, an average family household of four people  consumed 1,519 gallons of gas a year. That comes to 506 gallons for four months.
Now, here comes the tricky part, because while Obama refers to the increased cost of gas, he doesn't say between when and when. The national average for the price of gas on Aug. 1 was $3.90 a gallon; up from $2.86 on Aug. 1 last year. That's a $1.04 increase. At those prices, the increased cost this year for four months of gas would come to $526, which would obviously be covered by Obama's proposed $1,000 rebate. Even if you project out the increased cost based on the peak price of $4.11 a gallon on July 17, it only comes to an extra $632.50 for the next four months. So that part of Obama's equation is accurate.
Next, we looked at whether, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, $1,000 will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills.
The National Energy Assistance Directors' Association tracks such things.
In New England states, the association projects the additional cost for people who use home heating oil will be about $950. About half of New England's homes use home heating oil.
For those with natural gas, the added cost is projected to be about $335 higher; $450 more for people who use propane; and $780 more for those who use electricity. So no matter what form of energy they use to heat their homes, Obama's rebate would cover it.
""The numbers are just ridiculous,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. ""It's going to be really bad in cold weather states. People up there are in a total panic.""
Consider this stat: for a New England family making $50,000 a year, energy costs last winter ate up 22 percent of their overall pre-tax income; this winter it is projected to consume 38 percent.
""How are these families going to make it through the winter?"" Wolfe asked.
Wolfe said a $1,000 rebate would help many struggling families buy time to transition to the higher costs.",1,Barack Obama
"""In 2008, candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare."" As the presidential campaigns trade attacks about Medicare, a new TV ad from Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of hypocrisy.
The ad says that in 2008, Obama attacked his opponent, U.S. Sen. John McCain, for wanting to cut Medicare -- and then did so himself to to pay for Obamacare. The ad uses a clip of Obama speaking at a campaign rally in October 2008.
""Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth,"" Obama says from a podium.
The ad then says Obama ""cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare"" -- a claim PolitiFact previously rated Half True -- and concludes with another clip of Obama saying ""it ain’t right.""
""No, Mr. President,"" the announcer says, ""it ain't right.""
Here, we’ll rewind to 2008 to see how candidate Obama handled the delicate topic of Medicare. It turns out we fact-checked Obama's claim back then.
Rallying voters in Virginia
We went back to a transcript of the 2008 event to make sure Obama's comments were not taken out of context. Speaking before a crowd of more than 8,000 on Oct. 17, 2008, Obama unloaded on McCain’s Medicare proposal, according to a transcript of the event:
""It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth, $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care, to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall.
""Now, this should come as no surprise. It's entirely consistent with Sen. McCain's record during his 26 years in Congress, where time and again he's opposed Medicare. In fact, Sen. McCain has voted against protecting Medicare 40 times -- 40 times, he's failed to stand up for Medicare.
""So what would Sen. McCain's cuts mean for Medicare, at a time when more and more Americans are relying on it? It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year.
""If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs. You'll receive fewer services. You'll get lower-quality care.
""I don't think that's right. In fact, it ain't right. (Cheers.) When you've worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right, you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it.""
An ad, and ensuing criticism
Back in 2008, the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim.
""How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?"" the announcer said in the 2008 ad. ""His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion. That means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home care could suffer. ... After a lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan? It's not the change we need.""
PolitiFact examined the claim from Obama’s speech about McCain’s Medicare plan and rated it False .
""McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps,"" we wrote.
While not the same in every detail, McCain’s ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president.
The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad, saying it  ""does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group.""",1,Mitt Romney
"Joe Biden ""voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq."" John McCain's campaign readily acknowledges Joe Biden's expertise in national security matters. But that isn't stopping McCain surrogates from questioning the Democratic vice presidential nominee's judgment, especially when it comes to Iraq policy.
McCain ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., raised the issue in an Aug. 31, 2008, interview on ABC News' This Week, implying that Biden lacked the backbone to stand up to powerful foes or to fix broken governments.
""He has national security experience. But experience and judgment need to come together. He voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq,"" Graham said in response to a statement about Biden's national security experience.
As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden indeed opposed the troop buildup and called for separating Iraq into three autonomous provinces — Shiite, Sunni and Kurd. We've previously checked his Iraq policy in this story and in this ruling.
But what of his opposition to the first Gulf War?  It turns out Biden, with the majority of Senate Democrats, did oppose a 1991 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The question of whether to commit troops was the first decision the 102nd Congress faced upon convening in January 1991. In spite of diplomatic initiatives that followed Iraq's invasion, the elements of a major war were in place by Jan. 1: nearly 1-million troops poised along either side of Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia; the U.N. authorization for member nations to ""use any means necessary"" to secure Iraq's removal after Jan. 15; and Hussein's unwavering position that he would hold on to his conquest.
Congress was put in the position of making a firm and formal stand. Democratic leaders spurned President George H.W. Bush's request for an open-ended vote of support and urged members to delay any action on the crisis, lest it undermine a final attempt at a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, the Senate began debate on Jan. 4.
On Jan. 12, a sharply divided Congress authorized the president to go to war — the first time since World War II that Congress directly confronted the issue of sending large numbers of American troops into combat. The joint resolution authorized the president ""to use United States Armed Forces"" to enforce a Nov. 29, 1990, U.N. Security Council ultimatum that Iraq withdraw troops from Kuwait. The resolution put no time limit on the use of American force if Iraq failed to live up to the U.N.-imposed conditions.
The Senate voted 52-47 to authorize the use of force, with Biden among those voting no. Ten Democrats joined with virtually unanimous Republicans in support of the resolution. Minutes later, the House approved identical legislation by a vote of 250-183.
Most of the Democratic opponents argued that war should be only a last resort, and insisted that the administration and its allies should have waited months — and maybe as long as a year — on the expectation that the pressure from economic sanctions would eventually force Iraq to withdraw. That view was endorsed by some scholars and former Pentagon officials who had testified before congressional committees, but was emphatically disputed by others.
As the vote approached, Biden expressed concern about the United States bearing an undue burden of the military operations, and derided other nations in the anti-Iraq coalition, calling it, ""a coalition that has allowed us to take on 95 percent of the sacrifice across the board.""
The vote represented the thinnest congressional margin backing military action since the War of 1812. And senators split the same way on a resolution offered prior to the use of force measure by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that demanded a continued reliance on economic sanctions. That resolution was defeated 46-53, with Biden voting in favor.
On the campaign trail, Biden makes the case that he has the requisite toughness to go head-to-head with foreign leaders. As an example, he points to a 1993 encounter with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic duiring the Balkan wars in which he called Milosevic a war criminal to his face. But Biden's two votes on the eve of war in 1991 clearly show he favored continued economic sanctions over the use of military force. For this reason, we rule Graham's statement True.",1,Lindsey Graham
"Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families."" With a plummeting stock market grabbing headlines, Barack Obama tackled the economy in a speech in Elko, Nev.
""Change means a tax code that doesn’t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it,"" Obama said. He then went through a litany of his tax proposals, including, ""I will cut taxes — cut taxes — for 95 percent of all working families.""
We've checked out many claims on taxes . It's a subject area that's ripe for distortion and attack.
But with this affirmative claim, Obama appears to be on solid ground.
The linchpin here is Obama's tax credit for workers, which is intended to offset payroll taxes. Single people can qualify for a $500 credit; married people filing together could get $1,000.
Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts for people who make $200,000 or more if single and $250,000 or more as a married couple. His tax credits would phase out as they approach these incomes.
Most people, though, don't make more than $200,000. In fact, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics, about 97 percent of all filers made less than that.
Now it's into the nitty-gritty. Obama said his tax plan would reduce taxes for 95 percent of working families. We consulted the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which has created detailed models for how each candidate's tax proposal would affect American taxpayers. The center's complex model includes the indirect effects of certain tax policies, such as Obama's proposed rate increase for corporations.
The Tax Policy Center's analysis does not specifically look at the subset of tax filers who are ""working families."" But the center can make the following statements about Obama's tax proposal, said principal research associate Bob Williams:
• 95 percent of all tax filers (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their individual income taxes.
• 95 percent of all families with children (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their total federal taxes.
Every taxpayer has different individual circumstances, but if you make less than $200,000 a year and you work, we can't see how your taxes would go up under Obama's proposals. IRS data show that 97 percent of tax filers make less than $200,000, so there are even two percentage points worth of leeway there.",1,Barack Obama
"John McCain ""said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president."" James Dobson, an evangelical leader who founded the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, says he cannot support Sen. John McCain. He has gone so far as to say he will not vote for the first time in his life this November if McCain is the Republican nominee.
In a statement read by Laura Ingraham on her radio show, Dobson attacked McCain's conservative credentials, specifically his collegiality with Democrats. Dobson emphasized that the statement was his personal opinion, not that of Focus on the Family.
""I am convinced Sen. McCain is not a conservative, and in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are,"" the statement reads. ""He has at times sounded more like a member of the other party. McCain actually considered leaving the GOP in 2001, and approached John Kerry about being Kerry's running mate in 2004. McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Given these and many other concerns, a spoonful of sugar does not make the medicine go down. I cannot, and I will not vote for Sen. John McCain, as a matter of conscience.""
We've addressed a claim on McCain being considered as a running mate to John Kerry here. So we'll focus on Dobson's claim that McCain once said Sen. Clinton would make a good president.
According to a transcript of Meet the Press, Dobson is right.
Wrapping up a Feb. 20, 2005, appearance from Baghdad during a joint trip, the senators praised each other in a light-hearted exchange. McCain even ended the interview by acknowledging what trouble he'd gotten into.
Russert: ""Senator McCain, a serious question:  Do you think the lady to your right would make a good president?""
Clinton: ""Oh, we can't hear you, Tim. We can't hear you.""
McCain: ""Yeah, you're breaking up. I am sure that Senator Clinton would make a good president.  I happen to be a Republican and would support, obviously, a Republican nominee, but I have no doubt that Senator Clinton would make a good president.""
Russert: ""Equal time, Senator Clinton. The gentleman to your left?""
Clinton: ""Absolutely.""
Russert: ""We may have a fusion ticket right here.""
McCain: ""Thanks for doing that to us. Thanks for doing that to us, Tim.""
No spin in that exchange. We judge Dobson's statement to be True.",1,James Dobson
"Romney used to favor gun control, and said he didn't want to go back to Reagan-Bush. Mitt Romney says he is a supporter of gun rights and a fan of Ronald Reagan. But he didn't always tout those positions, a fact that John McCain uses to mock Romney in a new Internet ad.
Romney took positions favorable to gun control in previous races in Massachusetts, a state with strict gun control laws.
In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy.  During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons.
In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them."" The McCain ad accurately quotes Romney on this point.
Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, ""I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""
Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' Face the Nation on Oct. 21, 2007.
On the gun issue, Romney said, ""I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it.""
Unfortunately for Romney, he later had to revise his statement that he had the support of the NRA in the governor's race. The NRA did not endorse in that race. (See our previous check on that statement here .)
On his Reagan comment: ""Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. ... And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, 'No, I'm my own person.' ""
Romney has been attacked on these issues before; we checked an earlier claim here .
McCain's ad accurately conveys Romney's positions now and during the previous times Romney has run for office. The ad clearly labels which statements were made during which campaign.",1,John McCain
"The coalition of Arab states against Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi is the biggest coalition against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991. Shortly after the launch of air and missile attacks against Libya by an international alliance that included the United States, journalist Robin Wright sought to provide television viewers with some context for understanding the coalition of nations opposing Moammar Gadhafi, the alliance’s target.
During a roundtable segment on the March 20, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Wright -- a veteran diplomatic correspondent who’s now a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace -- whether Gadhafi is ""crazy"" and how secure his hold on power is.
""He could prolong this for a very long time,"" Wright said. ""This is not a man who plays by international rules, nor is he a man who thinks like even many of his counterparts in the Arab world, and that's why I think you've seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him. …""
Amanpour interjected, ""Which is really unusual, to have such a big Arab coalition against a fellow Arab leader.""
Wright agreed, saying, ""And we haven't had one like this since the Iraq war back in 1990-1991. And that's what's, in fact, given the international community the legs. Without that, we probably would not be engaged.""
We wondered whether Wright was correct about the scope of Arab support for these alliances. So we looked into it.
The Persian Gulf War
The Persian Gulf War was waged to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait, which had been invaded by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in August 1990. Thanks in large part to the diplomacy of then-President George H.W. Bush, a broad, international coalition was brought to bear against Hussein, and by the end of February 1991, allied troops had succeeded in pushing Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
Troops from several Arab states took part in ground combat, notably Egypt, Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Several smaller states along the Persian Gulf also took part in the war either in combat roles or by providing logistics or base support -- Bahrain , Morocco , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The main exception among major Arab states was Jordan, which sided with Iraq.
The Iraq War
The next major conflict involving an Arab leader was the Iraq War, launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush with the aim of toppling Hussein, who had remained in power despite the 1990-1991 war.
This conflict proved much more controversial internationally, and the Bush administration had little success signing up Arab support. Scott Althaus and Kalev Leetaru of the University of Illinois  at Urbana-Champaign have recorded in great detail the shifting membership of the ""coalition of the willing"" -- the younger Bush’s list of Iraq War supporters, but we could only find one Arab nation on the list, Kuwait.
Libya
Following a wave of popular uprisings against entrenched leaders across the Arab world, rebellion sprang up in Libya, which had been ruled for decades by Gadhafi. The rebels scored some quick victories, but by mid March, forces loyal to Gadhafi began to gain back lost territory. Fears of wider bloodshed rose, and international diplomacy kicked into high gear.
On March 12, 2011, the Arab League -- a group of nearly two dozen Arab nations that recently suspended Libya’s membership -- urged the United Nations to establish a ""no-fly"" zone aimed at crippling Gadhafi’s ability to strike the rebels from the air. On March 17, 2011, the U.N. Security Council complied, and the U.S., France and the United Kingdom drew up military plans. Attacks began on March 19.
In addition to the Arab League’s support for the mission, at least two Arab nations -- Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- have reportedly pledged tangible military assistance. On March 21, Al Jazeera reported that a French military spokesman had said that four Qatari jets were expected to take part in operations against Gadhafi.
In addition, there are unconfirmed news reports that Egypt is letting arms shipments into the rebels in neighboring eastern Libya, but the Egyptian government -- which is in a transitional status following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in a popular revolution earlier this year -- has not made any official pledges of military support.
Our conclusion
Wright is correct that the Libya campaign represents the largest alignment of Arab states against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991. However, the significance of this fact is the subject of some debate.
For starters, support for the Libyan situation is in flux. Just days after calling for the no-fly zone, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, backtracked somewhat by expressing reservations about the risks of civilian deaths in the initial round of attacks. Later, in comments to reporters in Cairo, he reaffirmed support for the coalition’s efforts. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether more Arab nations will join the effort individually -- and whether troops take as significant a role in the Libyan operations as Arab troops did during the Persian Gulf War.
In other words, it’s very early in the process, and Arab support could dissipate.
On the other hand, even if the extent of military assistance by Arab states proves to be limited, experts told PolitiFact that the political and diplomatic consequences so far are by themselves notable.
""I think Robin’s point is that Arab states have not lined up together, militarily or politically, against a fellow Arab leader like this since 1991,"" said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. ""They could have done so in other cases – in Sudan over Darfur, for example, or against Gadhafi at various points in the past, or even against Mubarak earlier this year. But they didn’t, and now they have. And I wouldn’t say that’s trivial.""
Stephen McInerney, executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, agreed, saying that the difference between the lack of Arab support for the Iraq War and the support for the situation in Libya is ""extremely significant.""
The full history of this episode remains to be written.",1,Robin Wright
"Says Donald Trump's use of the term ""fake news"" to undermine journalism ""seems (to have) inspired dictators and authoritarians."" Hours before President Donald Trump revealed the recipients of his ""fake news awards,"" one Republican lawmaker took to the Senate floor to deliver a stern warning about the perils of undermining journalism.
Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., cautioned that Trump’s anti-press rhetoric, such as calling the New York Times, CNN and ABC News an ""enemy of the American people,"" serves to embolden repressive governments around the world.
""Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press,""  Flake said, ""but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.""
Flake then ticked off several examples where foreign leaders deployed the phrase ""fake news"" to foster distrust of the media. Based on our review of the evidence, it’s reasonable to conclude that Trump’s disparagement of the media has been replicated abroad.
Invoking ‘fake news’ to deny atrocities, human rights abuses
An aide to Flake said the senator had referred to a Politico article that identified more than 15 instances where foreign leaders invoked the phrase ""fake news."" Here’s a sample:
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in February invoked ""fake news"" to dismiss an Amnesty International report that up to 13,000 prisoners had been executed in one of his military prisons, saying the allegations were a reminder that ""we are living in a fake news era.""
A security official in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in December used the term ""fake news"" to deny the very existence of the Rohingya people, a persecuted Muslim minority who are being ethnically cleansed , according to the United Nations. ""There is no such thing as Rohingya,"" the Myanmar official said . ""It is fake news.""
Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in July said it was ""fake news"" that a constitutional crisis was playing out in Venezuela against a backdrop of widespread protests, human rights abuses and long-standing economic privation. ""The media spreads lots of false versions, lots of lies. This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?"" he told Russian broadcaster RT , which the U.S. government considers a Kremlin propaganda outlet.
An op-ed with the headline ""Trump is right, fake news is the enemy, something China has known for years"" ran in May in the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in China, which is perennially a leading jailer of journalists.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in October said he had been "" demonized "" through "" fake news "" coverage of his brutal drug war, which has seen an unprecedented scale of extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch . At a joint press appearance in Manila in November, with Trump laughing at his side , Duterte called journalists ""spies.""
Trump’s rebranding of ‘fake news’
There’s reason to think Trump inspired these responses. He has helped to popularize the phrase ""fake news,"" while shifting its meaning.
According to CNN , Trump has used the word ""fake"" more than 400 times since his inauguration, including ""fake news"" and its variants. Overall, use of the phrase ""fake news"" across all forms of media increased 365 percent from November 2016 to November 2017, according to the Collins Dictionary , which named ""fake news"" its 2017 word of the year.
At PolitiFact, we have used the term ""fake news"" to refer to fabricated content masquerading as a portrayal of actual events, naming it our 2016 Lie of the Year after made-up stories dominated social media during the presidential election.
Trump, however, uses ""fake news"" to dismiss coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, or as a criticism against entire news organizations. He’s also taken credit for rebranding the term ""fake news"" to apply to fact-based journalism, calling it ""one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with.""
The epithet’s authoritarian appeal
Experts said it’s easy to see why Trump’s use of the term ""fake news"" appeals to authoritarian leaders. Authoritarian governments are typified by highly centralized power and the predominance of the state over individual rights.
""Every authoritarian needs to spread his own version of reality, and will invest time and resources to discredit anyone else's,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University. ""Many of them are corrupt, and if an investigation threatens to compromise their authority, or charges of wrongdoing come down, they need the public to believe only what they say.""
Ben-Ghiat said Trump’s consistent efforts to attack the press as purveyors of bias and lies against him, and incite hostility toward individual news outlets and journalists, can be seen as part of a larger campaign against sectors of society that value evidence and investigation.
""When Trump says ‘I am the only one who matters’ it is not just self-glorification, but a message about whose version of the facts should count in America,"" she said. ""How can foreign rulers not feel empowered by this?""
A First Amendment advocate we spoke to drew parallels between Trump’s use of the term ""fake news"" and George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, in which an authoritarian state inverts language to mean the opposite of its literal definition.
""It is a characteristic of authoritarian leaders, whether Communist or Nazi, to appropriate ordinary words and declare them to mean the opposite,"" Bruce Johnson, a Seattle-based media lawyer, told PolitiFact. ""Repressive regimes hold power by depriving their population of independent thinking and making the masses believe lies.""
It’s worth noting we found no mentions of ""fake news"" from foreign leaders before 2016.
Increased risk to journalists
The rise of the ""fake news"" epithet coincided with one of the most dangerous years for journalists.
Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists found 262 journalists were jailed for their work, a historic high for the second year in a row. In 21 cases, journalists were jailed under ""false news"" statutes, more than double the number in 2016, and in more countries, said Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at Committee to Protect Journalists.
""It’s created an environment where it’s more permissive for governments to jail journalists on false news charges,"" she said. ""They certainly don't think they're going to face many repercussions or condemnation from the United States when you have the president making those comments on a regular basis.""
Human rights activists say the growing disregard for facts has been making their job harder, too.
""Political leaders around the world have begun to deploy the label ‘fake news’ as a smear on fact-finding by journalists, human rights organizations, perhaps even prosecutors,"" wrote Iain Levine of Human Rights Watch. ""In doing so, they seek to break the link between evidence and culpability, making it more difficult to ensure those accountable pay for their misdeeds.""",1,Jeff Flake
"Says Mitt Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven. A snarky ad juxtaposes an off-key Mitt Romney leading a crowd singing America the Beautiful with claims on the screen saying the Republican candidate has parked millions of his personal fortune far from U.S. shores.
""He had millions in a Swiss bank account,"" the ad says, and in ""tax havens like Bermuda … and the Cayman Islands.""
It ends with: ""Mitt Romney’s not the solution.""
We rated the Swiss bank account claim True . Here we’ll dig into the Cayman Islands charge.
Romney has released his tax return for 2010 and an estimate for 2011 indicating that his income was $21.7 million in 2010 and $20.9 million last year. His financial disclosure , which is required of all presidential candidates, shows that Romney’s personal wealth is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million, according to the Washington Post .
News organizations have analyzed how Romney has invested his money, gleaned the greatest tax benefits and maximized profits at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded.
The Cayman Islands is mentioned in several of the reports:
* Romney utilized shell companies in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda to attract foreign investors to Bain, according to 2007 documents analyzed by the Los Angeles Times. The Times identified one such fund as BCIP Associates III Cayman. It’s listed on Romney’s 2007 financial disclosure as having paid him more than $1 million the previous year in dividends, interest and capital gains.
* Early in 2012, ABC News reported that Romney ""has as much as $8 million invested in at least 12 funds listed on a Cayman Islands registry. Another investment, which Romney reports as being worth between $5 million and $25 million, shows up on securities records as having been domiciled in the Caymans.""
That fund, called BCIP Trust Associates III, is part of his individual retirement account and provided between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in income, the disclosure shows.
David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, told PolitiFact that tax-exempt entities, including IRA accounts, sometimes invest through Cayman Islands corporations to reduce their U.S. taxes. ""Congress did not deliberately allow tax-exempts to reduce their U.S. taxes by investing through Cayman Islands corporations,"" Miller said. ""However, the practice is widespread and the IRS has approved of it.""
Miller agreed that it’s accurate to call the Cayman Islands a tax haven.
""That phrase usually refers to whether the jurisdiction imposes taxes and the Cayman Islands doesn’t,"" he said.
Other, more nuanced advantages exist for high net-worth individuals who put their money in foreign corporations. For example, a high net-worth individual can’t deduct the management fee paid to a fund manager, but a foreign corporation can.
""There are other advantages for U.S. taxpayers who invest through foreign corporations. They’re relatively subtle, but the advantages increase as the tax rates increase,"" Miller said.
Finally, in a transcript of a conference call hosted by the Romney campaign in January 2012, the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged the existence of the Cayman investments.
""These are investments in third-party entities,"" Malt said, likening them to stock in Toyota.
He continued: ""Each of these investments is in a blind trust. … This means the decision to make the investment was made by me, not by Gov. Romney. … I should say I, in turn, have no control over where these funds are formed. … When we make an investment in a Cayman fund, we're presented with investment documents, the sponsor has already chosen where the fund is to be organized, and to be perfectly clear, the blind trusts are a tiny part of the investor base of these funds.""
He went on to emphasize that each of the Cayman funds files a U.S. tax return, which reports the blind trust's share of the fund income. ""Every dime of that, in turn, is reported on Gov. Romney's tax returns,"" Malt said.
When we asked the Romney campaign for a response to the Obama ad, a spokesman emphasized these same points -- that Romney has paid all taxes he owed, that investment decisions were made by the trustee and the trustee does not decide where the funds are ""domiciled.""",1,Barack Obama
"Food stamp spending ""doubled under President Bush, doubled again under President Obama."" Food stamp spending doubled under President Barack Obama — after doubling under his Republican predecessor, says Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.
That’s one reason he’s disappointed that House lawmakers missed a chance to push for more than $20 billion in savings over 10 years when they stripped nutrition programs from the farm bill . Now they may be stuck with current law or the Senate bill , he said, which aims to trim about $4 billion .
""I would argue what we missed, as Republicans, was the chance for real reform,"" he said in an  MSNBC interview July 16, 2013. ""We could have gotten some reductions. It's a program that's doubled under President (George W.) Bush, doubled again under President Obama. So, you know, program this big, there's some things you can do differently and still help people that need it.""
We wondered: Did such spending double under Bush, then double again?
SNAP growth
We’ll start by noting that food stamps have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008.
It’s the federal government’s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards.
The 2007-09 recession drove the number of folks on food stamps to a record high under Obama. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help. A Washington Post reporter this year documented one Rhode Island town’s reliance on its monthly SNAP infusion.
We asked Cole for his evidence that spending doubled under Bush before doubling under Obama. The congressman provided numbers from the agency that administers the program, the U.S. Agriculture Department.
He compared total costs of the program from the start of Bush’s term in 2000 to the end of his second term in 2008, then growth from 2008 to the most recent fiscal year available, 2012. Costs had more than doubled under Bush, from $17 billion to $38 billion, then doubled again under Obama, to $78 billion.
Cole didn’t adjust for inflation, but he should have: A more accurate inflation-adjusted measure even more closely matches his claim. Total spending on SNAP in 2012 dollars doubled under Bush, from $20 billion to $40 billion, and very nearly doubled under Obama, $40 billion to $78 billion.
Why?
The story since 2007 is still fresh: joblessness driven by the recession made more people eligible for help, and also drove more folks who were already eligible for help to ask for it, perhaps because their other support networks were tapped out. The stimulus bill also included a boost in benefits, which temporarily increased costs. That expires in November.
The recession also partly explains the rise in benefits before Bush left office in 2008.
But it was the presidency of Bill Clinton and the 1996 welfare reform that set the stage for rising benefits under Bush. Under Clinton, spending had fallen nearly 40 percent, partly because of new limits in the law. By the late 1990s, lawmakers were already starting to roll back some restrictions, according to the Congressional Budget Office .
""The increases were largely a rebound from the deep cuts the program sustained in the 1996 welfare law and strengthening the program’s ability to support working families,"" said Dottie Rosenbaum, who worked in the Congressional Budget Office at the time. She’s now a senior policy analyst with the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Bush on welfare policy at the time of the 2002 farm bill, said the goal then was to expand food programs for low-income working families. The bill made it easier for states to administer the programs and to get more eligible people signed up.
""If they're willing to work for 9 or 10 bucks an hour, and get our kids out of poverty, then we ought to help them,"" he said.
He said he’s concerned by the increase in spending on food stamps, and has testified before Congress on ways to reduce it, including requiring more evidence for families to claim deductions that help them qualify for benefits.
Rosenbaum argues no change is required. Spending will come down on its own as the economy recovers. About 65 percent of the growth in spending from 2007 to 2011 was driven by an increase in the number of people eligible for food stamps in the poor economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office. About 20 percent of growth came from the temporarily higher benefits under the stimulus bill.
In other words, the economy by itself will bring food stamp spending down.
""The more recent growth is driven primarily by the recession and is evidence that SNAP is doing precisely what it is designed to do: quickly help more low-income families during economic downturns as poverty rises, unemployment mounts, and more people need assistance,"" she said.",1,Tom Cole
"Sen. Harry Reid voted ""against declaring English our national language, twice."" The Sharron Angle campaign calls its ad ""The Wave."" But you may know it as the ad that prompted Joy Behar of ABC's The View to say: ""I'd like to see her do this ad in the south Bronx. Come here, b----. Come to New York and do it.""
Condemned in some Democratic and Hispanic circles as ""racist,"" the ad portrays Angle's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Harry Reid, as a friend to illegal immigrants.
Here's the text of the ad: ""Waves of illegal aliens streaming across our border joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear. And what is Harry Reid doing about it? Voting to give illegal aliens Social Security benefits, tax breaks and college tuition, voting against declaring English our national language twice and even siding with Obama and the president of Mexico to block Arizona's tough new immigration law. Harry Reid....it's clear whose side he's on, and it's not yours.""
In a fact-check of a previous campaign ad , we dealt with Angle's claims that Reid voted to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits ( Barely True ) and special tax breaks ( False ).
Here, we're checking the claim that Reid voted against ""declaring English our national language, twice.""
During a big push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment ( S.AMDT.4064 ) ""to declare English as the national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective U.S. citizens.""
The amendment would have required all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English. It also sought to establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Arguing for the amendment, Inhofe said providing multilingual assistance costs the government more than $1 billion per year. Under the Inhofe's proposal, immigrants seeking to become permanent legal residents would have had to prove they had learned English.
Reid made an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on May 18, 2006, denouncing the bill as ""racist"" and ""divisive."" Here's a sampling of some of his comments to give you a flavor of Reid's position:
-- ""While the intent may not be there, I really believe this amendment is racist. I think it is directed basically to people who speak Spanish.""
-- ""I think we should make sure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to somebody who can speak Spanish.""
-- ""Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. We want people to integrate, to learn English, but they need tools to do this no matter what their native language. This amendment takes some of those tools away, and we need all of those tools.""
-- ""The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is English as a second language. This will slow that down. This amendment impacts English speakers, reporting of crimes, reporting of diseases, involvement in commerce. Next, is it going to impact upon the right to vote?""
-- ""This amendment is divisive. We should be here to unify our country, not divide it by ethnicity or language differences. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Everyone who speaks with an accent knows that they need to learn English as fast as they can. Success in America means the ability to speak English. That is the way it is now. We don’t need this amendment. Speaking English is critical to the functioning of anyone in our country. It is the language of our government, of our nation, and as I have indicated before, air traffic controllers and diplomacy. This amendment, I believe, is unconstitutional. It raises serious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their rights.""
-- ""This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of federal law, I believe, that guarantee the right of non-English-speaking students to learn English in our public schools.""
-- ""This amendment conflicts with provisions of federal law that require language materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas of non-English languages, where there is evidence of educational discrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration turnout.""
-- ""There has been substantial evidence of harassment, intimidation, even violence against language minority voters. This provision makes a blatant violation of the 14th and 15th amendments and criminal provisions of the Voting Rights Act more likely to occur.""
-- ""By the very terms of this amendment, persons accused of crimes would be denied the ability, I believe, to receive information material in their native language to assist in their own defense. This clearly violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment of our Constitution.""
-- ""I have talked about public health. This amendment will stand in the way of efforts made to facilitate the transmission of vital information necessary for the receipt of health care and public safety, including informed consent by non-English-speaking patients.""
-- ""I hope we reject this amendment. It is bad policy. It is un-American. It turns back the clock on the substantial gains that language minority citizens have made. I hope that there will be a resounding vote against this. I have no problem going home today and telling the people of the State of Nevada: English is the language of America. We are not going to change that with this amendment. This is divisive, it is mean spirited. I think it is the wrong way to go.""
So tell us how you really feel about the amendment, Senator.
Needless to say, Reid voted against it, but with the help of 11 Democrats, the amendment passed 62-35.
Interestingly, the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment ( S.AMDT.4073 ) proposed by then Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language."" Reid voted for that amendment, which passed by a vote of 58 to 39.
The immigration reform bill did not pass that year, however, and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007, Inhofe again proposed an amendment ( S.AMDT.1151 ) ""to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States, and for other purposes."" Reid again voted against it, though the measure passed 64-33. But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either. To this day, no ""official language"" exists at the federal level.
The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to ""declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States,"" even as he voted for an amendment ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States."" The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language. Reid not only voted against the bills, he was quite vocal in his opposition.",1,Sharron Angle
"""As governor, I've stood up to ... the big oil companies."" In her first speech as Sen. John McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin claimed a credential that might resonate with a nation blanching at the cost of gasoline — a record of taking on Big Oil.
""Along with fellow reformers in the great state of Alaska, as governor, I've stood up to the old politics as usual, to the special interests, to the lobbyists, the big oil companies, and the good-old-boy network,"" Palin said, speaking to a crowd in Dayton, Ohio, after McCain introduced her to the nation on Aug. 29, 2008. ""When oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase, I sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska. And we are now — we're now embarking on a $40-billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.""
We've already checked her claim that she sent ""a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska."" We ruled it True.
So here we'll examine whether she really stood up to the big oil companies, some of the most influential players in Alaska's political scene.
Palin was sworn in as governor on Dec. 4, 2006. Over the course of 2007, she fought to raise taxes on oil companies. Alaska gets about 85 percent of its state revenue from oil taxes, and as fuel prices skyrocketed, Palin complained the state wasn't getting its share of the windfall. She successfully pushed for a law that raised taxes on oil profits to 25 percent from 22.5, winning passage in the State Legislature in November 2007. The increase amounted to an estimated $1.6-billion annually more for the state.
Oil companies had opposed the increase, with executives saying it would discourage them from investing in the state. BP Alaska president Doug Suttles said after the Legislature passed the increase: ""I can only hope that once the impact of this legislation is clear, the administration and the Legislature will revisit the issue.""
So yes, with respect to taxes, Palin stood up to big oil companies.
Palin has also sparred with big oil companies over who gets to build a pipeline to carry natural gas to market from Alaska's North Slope. The fields there have enormous gas reserves, but so far they have remained largely untapped due to the lack of a pipeline. Palin's predecessor, Frank Murkowski, supported a contract between the state and BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil to develop the pipeline. Palin opposed that, promising to consider other companies.
Indeed, after she was elected she solicited other bids, and ended up supporting a proposal by TransCanada Corp. to build a 1,715-mile pipeline down the Alaska Highway and through Canada. Exxon, ConocoPhillips and BP all criticized Palin's move to give the job to the Calgary-based company.
""She has taken an independent position and she has been protective of state sovereignty,"" said Gerald McBeath, political science professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
So in the pipeline battle as well, Palin took on big oil.
Palin also continued efforts Murkowski had launched to take back leases the state had awarded to Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips in the giant Point Thomson oil and gas field. Alaska officials were annoyed that the companies had not developed the field, which would boost state revenue. The companies said the fields posed technical challenges.
In that respect as well, Palin stood up to big oil.
We should note that Palin has been far friendlier to the oil industry than environmentalists would like to see the governor be. ""She's definitely been very supportive of any increased oil and gas development,"" said Patricia Rolfe, Alaska regional representative of the Sierra Club. ""In general, it's business as usual for oil companies in Alaska.""
Palin has supported the controversial idea of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has sued the federal government to oppose listing the polar bear as an endangered species, which would curtail energy development.
But she didn't claim to have opposed big oil companies on everything — she merely claimed to have stood up to them. And that she did, with respect to taxes, Point Thomson leases and the North Slope pipeline.",1,Sarah Palin
"""Large majorities"" of the public ""oppose major changes to Medicare"" and favor higher taxes on the wealthy. The debate to balance the federal budget and reduce the nation's debt has raged in recent weeks, with Democrats and Republicans arguing about spending, taxes and entitlements such as Medicare.
Paul Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column that a knock-down, drag-out fight may be inevitable, given that the two parties have such different visions for the country.
""So when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where’s the common ground?"" Krugman wrote.
Krugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public.
""For what it’s worth, polls suggest that the public’s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget,"" Krugman said. ""Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities — including a majority of Republicans — also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that’s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.""
We decided to check Krugman’s numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it.  Let’s take the issues one at a time.
""Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.""
Different polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugman’s point.
""In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year?"" Support: 72 percent. Oppose: 27 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. ( ABC News/Washington Post Poll . April 14-17, 2011)
""Do you support or oppose doing each of the following to deal with the federal budget deficit? … Increase taxes on income over $250,000."" Support: 64 percent. Oppose: 33 percent. Unsure: 3 percent. ( McClatchy-Marist Poll . April 10-14, 2011.)
""Now looking ahead to next year's federal budget, do you think it should or should not include higher taxes for families with household incomes of $250,000 and above?"" Should: 59 percent. Should not: 37 percent. Unsure: 4 percent. ( USA Today/Gallup Poll . April 11, 2011.)
Krugman seems on firm ground here.
Large majorities ""also oppose major changes to Medicare.""
Again, we found several recent poll questions addressing this point.
""In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose cutting spending on Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for the elderly?"" Oppose: 78 percent. Support: 21 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. ( ABC News/Washington Post Poll . April 14-17, 2011.)
""I'm going to read you two statements about the future of the Medicare program. After I read both statements, please tell me which one comes closer to your own view. Medicare should remain as it is today, with a defined set of benefits for people over 65. OR, Medicare should be changed so that people over 65 would receive a check or voucher from the government each year for a fixed amount they can use to shop for their own private health insurance policy."" Should remain as is: 65 percent. Should be changed: 34 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. (Also from the ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)
""Do you think the government should completely overhaul Medicare to control the cost of the program, make major changes to Medicare but not completely overhaul it, make minor changes to Medicare, or should the government not try to control the costs of Medicare?"" Not try to control costs: 27 percent. Minor changes: 34 percent. Major changes: 18 percent. Completely overhaul: 13 percent. Unsure: 8 percent. ( USA Today/Gallup Poll . April 11, 2011.)
""In order to reduce the federal budget deficit, would you be willing or not willing to reduce spending on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors?"" Not willing: 76 percent. Willing: 22 percent. Don't know/No answer: 2 percent. ( CBS News Poll . March 18-21, 2011.)
""Do you think it will be necessary to cut spending on Medicare, the federal government health care program for seniors, in order to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit?"" No: 54 percent. No opinion: 27 percent. Yes: 18 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. ( NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll . Feb. 24-26, 2011.)
""For each (government program), please tell me if you think significantly cutting the funding is totally acceptable, mostly acceptable, mostly unacceptable, totally unacceptable: Medicare."" Totally unacceptable: 46 percent. Mostly unacceptable: 30 percent. Mostly acceptable: 16 percent. Totally acceptable: 7 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (Also from NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)
Those numbers express widespread opposition to cutting Medicare. And indeed, when the Wall Street Journal  reported its results in February, Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the results were ""a huge flashing yellow sign for Republicans on how much preparation will be needed if they propose to change Social Security and Medicare.""
As we were working on this report, a new poll was released suggesting that the public might not be so opposed to changes in Medicare. We should note that these results were released publicly after Krugman's column appeared. As explained in the Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter , our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks.
""In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance. Would you approve or disapprove of changing Medicare in this way?"" Approve: 47 percent. Disapprove: 41 percent. Don't Know/No answer: 12 percent. ( New York Times/CBS News Poll . April  15-20, 2011.)
The New York Times noted in its story that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked.
When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it's at odds with the other previous polls. ""I strongly suspect that the Times result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we're hearing,"" Krugman said via e-mail.
We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes.",1,Paul Krugman
"""Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a startling statistic to his followers on July 22, 2012: ""Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America.""
Sanders speaks and writes frequently about wealth distribution in the U.S., a hot-button issue among liberals and a rallying cry of the Occupy Wall Street Movement.
The Waltons, of course, are members of the proverbial 1 percent. But are they really sitting on that much wealth? We decided to check it out.
First, what is wealth?
In economics, wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth, and it’s defined as the value of assets minus liabilities. For someone in the middle class, that could encompass the value of their 401(k) or other retirement accounts, bank savings and personal assets such as jewelry or cars, minus what they owe on a home mortgage, credit cards and a car note.
It does not include income -- what people earn in wages. For that reason, someone who earns a good salary but has little savings and owes a lot of money on their house would have a negative net worth.
In fact, because so many Americans invest in real estate to buy a home, middle-class wealth has been one of the biggest casualties of the housing-driven recession.
From 2007 to 2010, typical families lost 39 percent of their wealth, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances , done every three years. In 2007, the median family net worth was $126,400. In 2010, it was $77,300, according to the survey.
Where the Waltons fit in
Six members of the Walton family appear on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. Christy Walton, widow of the late John Walton, leads the clan at No. 6 with a net worth of $25.3 billion as of March 2012. She is also the richest woman in the world for the seventh year in a row, according to Forbes. Here are the other five:
No. 9: Jim Walton, $23.7 billion
No. 10: Alice Walton, $23.3 billion
No. 11: S. Robson Walton, oldest son of Sam Walton, $23.1 billion
No. 103: Ann Walton Kroenke, $3.9 billion
No. 139: Nancy Walton Laurie, $3.4 billion
That’s a grand total of $102.7 billion for the whole family.
Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California-Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Survey of Consumer Finances. (She used the Waltons’ wealth from 2010, which was valued at $89.5 billion.)
Allegretto found that in 2007, the wealth held by the six Waltons was equal to that of the bottom 30.5 percent of families in the U.S. In 2010, the Waltons’ share equaled the entire bottom 41.5 percent of families.
That 41.5 percent represents nearly 49 million families, notes Josh Bivens at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. While median family wealth fell by 38.8 percent, Bivens wrote, the wealth of the Walton family members rose from $73.3 billion in 2007 to $89.5 billion in 2010, or about 22 percent growth.
Other analysis
At Forbes, source of the richest 400 list, Tim Worstall wrote a response to the Waltons wealth claim. He did not dispute the accuracy of the statistic but offered some broader perspective.
""Wealth is always more unequally distributed than income,"" Worstall wrote. ""By the way, it isn’t even true that all of those households with zero or negative wealth are what we would call poor, either. It’s entirely possible to have no net assets while having a good income, even a high income. All you need to have is debts higher than your assets: something that will almost certainly be true of anyone with student debt and fresh out of college, for example.""
He added: ""If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket you have more wealth than 25 percent of Americans.""
Bivens, for good measure, calculated the comparison of the Waltons vs. all Americans after removing households with a negative net worth -- those that drag down the overall average and make the Waltons’ advantage look greater. He found that the Walmart heirs’ $89.5 billion ""is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 33.2 million families (about 28.2 percent of the total).""",1,Bernie Sanders
"President Barack Obama ""reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011."" As the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the national health care law, a new Barack Obama campaign ad touts the improvements in Medicare benefits contained in the legislation.
Video clips of President Obama speaking about eliminating Medicare fraud play are interspersed with still shots of the president embracing retirees.
The text: ""As president he signed the Affordable Care Act ... and reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011.""
We’re checking whether the ad is accurate that the health law -- and Obama, by extension -- are to credit for that many Medicare recipients paying less for prescription drugs last year.
The doughnut hole
Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs for beneficiaries, has always contained a coverage gap. The plan pays for drugs up to a dollar amount, but then Medicare recipients must cover the entire cost of prescriptions until catastrophic coverage kicks in.
Currently, beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions. Then insurance then pays up to $2,830. At that point they’re in what's known as the doughnut hole with a gap in coverage until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. At that point, their coverage takes over again, usually paying about 95 percent of the costs.
Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University, co-wrote a study for the Kaiser Family Foundation last year on the coverage gap. He pointed out that even those who reach the catastrophic threshold do so only after they have been paying the full price of their prescriptions for several months.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slowly phases out the doughnut hole through price discounts and government subsidies, eliminating it completely in 2020.
The 2011 phase
Last year, under the terms of the health care law, the doughnut hole shrank a little with those eligible for Medicare receiving discounts on drugs once they reached the coverage gap.
Drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50 percent discount for covered brand name drugs, while there were federal subsidies (7 percent discount) for generic drugs, said Elizabeth Hargrave, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study with Hoadley.
""The brand-name drug discounts do not cause beneficiaries to reach the catastrophic coverage more slowly – they’re counted as if beneficiaries paid these amounts out of pocket. So this is true savings even for beneficiaries who subsequently reach the catastrophic limit,"" Hargrave added.
Both discounts will increase over time until the doughnut hole is effectively closed in 2020, she said.
So the reduced drug costs are real. What about the number of people who benefitted?
‘Nearly 3.6 million Americans’
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that total discounts added up to $2.1 billion, or an average of $604 per beneficiary.
It also said 3,576,640 people enjoyed those savings. (For a state-by-state breakdown, check out the chart at the bottom of the fact sheet.)
The CMS numbers are based on 2011 Part D claims data received through Feb. 29, 2012, the agency said.
We didn’t see any reason to doubt the figures, but CMS is a federal agency under Obama, and this is an Obama campaign ad. So we ran it by Hoadley and Hargrave, who both said the 3.6 million figure checks out.
Hargrave pointed us to another CMS chart , which totalled the number of beneficiaries in the doughnut hole in 2011 at 3,758,024 -- including the territories -- and about 3.6 million in the 50 states. (See the first chart in the zip file.)",1,Barack Obama
"Currently, the intelligence community ""can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."" While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists, they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance . Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week.
On June 9, 2013, ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. In a floor speech roughly two years ago , Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act, one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence.
Udall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States, but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details. Instead, he warned broadly that the intelligence community ""can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.""
Udall’s office affirmed that they still reflect the senator’s position. So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally ""collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.""
Udall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law. This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of ""metadata"" -- information on phone numbers, call durations and other information short of the actual conversations -- from Verizon customers.
Section 215 allows the FBI to require ""the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism.""
However, the government faces some limits. The FBI must demonstrate to a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism. Approval must be renewed every three months. The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation.
After the  Guardian  published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, addressed the ""business records"" provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
Clapper said the ""program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber. The only type of information acquired under the court’s order is telephony metadata, such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls,"" Clapper said in a written statement.
Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215.
In short, the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court, and it produced what the government considered ""business records"" -- specifically, metadata. Information on millions of Americans was accessed, almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism.
Udall’s claim appears accurate. Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program ; the FISA court approved it, apparently on multiple occasions.
Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005, said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing.
""It is being done,"" Graham said. ""Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts, that would suggest that it is within the agency’s authority to do so.""
Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law, concurred that the law seems to be on the government’s side.
""Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data be ‘relevant’ to a national security/terrorism investigation, not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection,"" Vladeck said.
Still, we’ll point out a few things.
First, just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesn’t mean that the metadata-collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program , for instance.
And the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties, charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority. The group said the government had failed to provide ""reasonable grounds"" for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records.
Second, there’s a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it. While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database, it cannot legally access that information willy-nilly. Before it can drill down into actual phone calls, it has to meet a higher legal standard: The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity. Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy.",1,Mark Udall
"""(John McCain) was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry."" Republicans have often questioned Sen. John McCain's conservative stripes, and the idea that he was a potential running mate for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 stokes their suspicions even more.
The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund is currently on the attack, launching an ad that at first appears to be aimed at Hillary Clinton.
""One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times. ... And was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.""
A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal McCain; the narrator says, ""Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain.""
We checked the claim on McCain's votes here.
As for the charge that McCain was mentioned as a running mate with Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004? That's true.
There are many, many references in the media to the idea that McCain was possible for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. Here are just a few:
• In March 2004, reports about the offer prompted Good Morning America host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show. McCain answered: ""John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it. But there's, I see no scenario, no scenario, no scenario where I, I foresee no scenario where that would happen.""
• After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004, the Washington Post reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket, ""but McCain made clear he was not interested.""
• A February 2007 article in Vanity Fair magazine titled ""Prisoner of Conscience"" says: ""Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCain's interest in running for vice president on a national-unity ticket (and McCain basked in the courtship, even if he knew nothing could ever come of it).
• And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD.com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: ""It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active — let's put it that way.""
We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he ""was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry."" We rule this statement True.",1,Citizens United Political Victory Fund
"""The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests."" Facing international condemnation for a recent underground nuclear weapon test, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a statement accusing the United Nations Security Council of hypocrisy.
""There is a limit to our patience,"" its Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried on the official Korean Central News Agency. ""The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests.""
As a matter of policy, PolitiFact does not take totalitarian dictatorships at their word. Beyond that, we were simply curious which countries have done nuclear weapons testing, and how much. So we decided to check this claim.
According to a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, there have been 2,051 nuclear tests worldwide since 1945 done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council:
U.S. - 1,030
Russia/U.S.S.R - 715
U.K. - 45
France - 210
China - 45
There have been only a handful of other tests, although there are doubts about the exact number.
In 1974, India tested a nuclear device, although it produced a relatively small explosive yield. India claimed to have detonated five more nuclear devices in May 1998.  In response to the Indian tests, Pakistan announced that it had exploded five nuclear devices a couple weeks later.
It has been widely speculated that India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and size of the explosions for political reasons. Nonetheless, that's the number of announced nuclear tests.
Since then, North Korea is the only country to perform an announced test. Its first came in 2006. And then on May 26, 2009, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted its second underground nuclear test, in defiance of international warnings.
(There has also been some speculation that Israel may have conducted a test in 1979, but those claims have never been substantiated.)
So arguably, there have been as many as 13 nuclear tests conducted by countries other than the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said Carey Sublette, creator of the Nuclear Weapon Archive, which tracks nuclear testing via public records. By Sublette's count, there have been a total of 2,054 nuclear tests. That means 99.37 percent of all the tests were done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, he said.
""It's about right,"" Sublette said of the figures cited by North Korea. ""If it's off, it's only off by a few (tests).""
We aren't inclined to quibble with fractions of one percent.",1,North Korean foreign ministry
"""About halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money."" ""In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money.""
In an op-ed published April 26, House Republican Leader John Boehner laid out a case for ""Debt Day.""
""It is the day of the Fiscal Year — beginning on Oct. 1 of the previous calendar year — on which total government spending exceeds total federal revenues,"" Boehner wrote. ""And in our current fiscal year, that falls on April 26 — this Sunday, just days before the administration’s 100th day milestone. In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money.""
Now keep in mind, we know ""Debt Day"" is not a literal concept. Thanks to withholding and estimated taxes, the government collects income tax revenues year-round, and it has other sources of tax revenues as well. It also borrows money by selling U.S. Treasury securities. So the government does not have to shut down because its pockets are empty.
Boehner acknowledges that, calling it a symbol of ""our government’s arrogant culture of spending."" We were intrigued by the ""Debt Day"" claim and wanted to check Boehner's numbers for accuracy.
He uses numbers provided by the Congressional Budget Office that are widely regarded as fair and accurate. And he accurately explains how he uses them to calculate debt.
Boehner blames the Obama administration for a ""borrowing binge"" in his editorial, but it's only fair to note that the 2009 budget started back on Oct. 1, 2008, when Boehner's fellow Republican George W. Bush was president. Parts of that budget were finalized, however, under Obama's watch on March 11, 2009.
Boehner also notes accurately that ""Debt Day"" has arrived earlier this year than any time in the past decade, since the surpluses that marked the end of the Clinton administration.
Here are the ""Debt Days"" for previous years, based on CBO numbers. Again, it's important to remember the calendar for these dates starts Oct. 1 of the previous year, not Jan. 1. We've also included the percentage of each year's budget that was actually paid with government revenues, as opposed to borrowing:
2002 - Sept. 2 - 92 percent
2003 - July 29 - 83 percent
2004 - July 27 - 82 percent
2005 - Aug. 14 - 87 percent
2006 - Aug. 27 - 91 percent
2007 - Sept. 9 - 94 percent
2008 - Aug. 5 - 84 percent
2009 - April 26 - 57 percent
Boehner carefully explains how he arrives at the ""Debt Day"" number, and he uses widely accepted numbers in his calculations. The statement we're checking here is, ""In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money."" That ""halfway"" number is a little bit of a push; it's actually 57 percent of the year. And, the ""run out of money"" is metaphorical, not literal. But Boehner is right with his central point that we're spending more money than we're taking in, and that the difference is close to the halfway mark this fiscal year.",1,John Boehner
"Obama spent ""40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians."" In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, former President Bill Clinton stated that an inordinate amount of money distributed by Sen. Barack Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund, went to elected officials in states with early primaries.
It was a key point in Clinton's argument that Obama has not been true to his pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president.
Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates. Members use the committees to solidify relationships with other members of Congress who might later support them in a run for a leadership post within Congress or in a bid for higher office. Most politicians shelve their leadership PACs once they formally announce their candidacy for president.
But Obama didn't.
In the months after Obama announced his candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007, Hopefund distributed more than $400,000 to federal and state political candidates and parties.
Said Clinton: ""In the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population, after he is a political candidate. And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups.
""Now, he can say that this is just a blind coincidence, although he admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign about how to spend that money out.""
A PolitiFact analysis of the political contributions made by Obama's Hopefund after Obama officially announced his candidacy found that $185,000 went to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina (the overwhelming majority went to Iowa, $95,500, and New Hampshire, $82,000). Another $251,000 went to candidates or state parties in 26 other states, according to a review of Hopefund disbursements listed at Opensecrets.org.
That means 42.4 percent of Hopefund disbursements were spent in the four states. So Clinton is dead on there.
And Clinton rightly notes that these states constitute just 3.7 percent of America's population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The implication is that the money was spent only to curry favor with politicians in early-voting states that could give Obama's campaign a boost.
""You are building your political clout, so you can call in favors in the future,"" said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that specializes in analyzing campaign finance.
In December, the Clinton campaign called on Obama to close Hopefund and contended that the disbursements after Obama announced his candidacy violated election laws. Though no laws specifically require candidates to close their leadership PACs, Ryan said, it is a legal gray area and most politicians shelve them just to be sure. Obama and his staff maintained then that they did nothing improper.
The line was muddied some with a Washington Post story on Nov. 30, 2007, that quoted a campaign source acknowledging that Obama's presidential campaign was consulted by Hopefund officials about how to disburse its remaining funds.
One can argue whether leadership PAC disbursements to other candidates count as presidential campaigning, or whether the inordinate amounts of money going to states with early primaries proves it  — we think they probably do.
But we're evaluating Clinton's statement about how much PAC money Obama spent in the early-primary states. And Clinton is pretty much on target when he says 43 percent went to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.",1,Bill Clinton
"""Today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America."" During an Oct. 4, 2011, interview on MSNBC, host Ed Schultz and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., discussed the ""Occupy Wall Street"" protests, which are targeting the financial services sector. Sanders offered a statistic designed to demonstrate the power of American banks.
Sanders suggested that many of the protesters ""have not seen the president be as strong as he should be on Wall Street,"" saying they want the federal government to take tougher measures against financial-services companies.
""Ed, today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America,"" Sanders said. (GDP stands for gross domestic product.)
We wondered whether Sanders’ math was correct.
When we contacted Sanders’ office, a spokesman provided testimony to a congressional oversight panel by Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of
Management. ""Our six largest bank holding companies currently have assets valued at just over 63 percent of GDP,"" Johnson testified, citing figures for the fourth quarter of 2010. ""This is up from around 55 percent of GDP before the crisis (e.g., 2006) and no more than 17 percent of GDP in 1995.""
We wanted to find the original statistics, and we located them in a chart posted by the National Information Center, the federal repository of data about banks and other institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory, regulatory or research interest. The chart lists the 50 biggest bank holding companies as of June 30, 2011.
Here are the top six and their total assets:
1. Bank of America Corp., $2.264 trillion
2. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., $2.246 trillion
3. Citigroup Inc., $1.957 trillion
4. Wells Fargo & Co., $1.260 trillion
5. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., $937 billion
6. Morgan Stanley, $831 billion
Together, the top six companies’ assets were $9.495 trillion.
For the second part of the equation -- gross domestic product -- we turned to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Though the time spans don’t line up perfectly, we decided to use the GDP figure for 2010, the most recent full year. That figure is $14.527 trillion.
Dividing these top banks’ assets by the national GDP produces a result of 65 percent -- which is actually a slightly larger percentage than Sanders had indicated, but certainly in the ballpark.
To make sure we weren’t missing something, we contacted a few experts on financial services issues. They offered a few caveats:
• The comparison is a bit of apples vs. oranges. The banks’ asset figures are an aggregation measured at a single point in time, whereas the GDP figure is an aggregation of goods and services measured over time. ""This distinction is the equivalent to a comparison of your net worth with your personal income,"" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. ""Economists generally don't find these sorts of comparisons very useful or interesting. So the best that can be said is that these comparisons provide a rough sense of comparative magnitudes.""
• The data are constantly moving. ""Several of these banks, especially Bank of America, have lost significant"" value since the figures were published in June 2011, said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The denominator, GDP, is always changing, as well. So, any estimate is true for a specific point in time, but possibly out of date not long after it’s made.
• Banks’ overseas holdings significantly complicate the comparison. For starters, the comparison Sanders is making doesn’t mean that these banks own 60 percent of the U.S. wealth, because some of these banks’ assets are in overseas holdings. However, Sanders appears to be on safe ground with his phrasing, since all he said was that the two dollar figures were ""equivalent.""
Potentially more problematic for Sanders is that the assets-to-GDP ratio for the top six bank companies in the U.S. are actually quite modest when compared to the biggest banks in other nations.
A 2010 study by J.P. Morgan listed the 25 biggest banks internationally in 2008, along with the percentages of their home country’s GDP. The highest was UBS, with 376 percent of Switzerland’s GDP. And six other banks all had assets as large as their home country’s GDP -- Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland (218 percent), Dexia of Belgium (180 percent), Fortis of the Netherlands (155 percent), Royal Bank of Scotland of the United Kingdom (131 percent), Barclays of the United Kingdom (112 percent) and BNP Paribas of France (101 percent).
All of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the U.S., in part because America’s GDP is so much larger than the GDP of these other nations.
The significance of this fact for Sanders’ assertion, however, is less clear.
""This doesn't tell us what is a ‘proper’ or ‘appropriate’ number,"" Thallam said. ""One might reply that other countries are much more concentrated, but that only means they're worse -- not that we're in a good position."" Some scholars, he added, have said that even at current concentration levels, U.S. banks should be broken up because they create a ""too big to fail"" problem. ""On the other hand, people for years said that banking exhibited economies of scale, so consolidation was natural,"" Thallam said.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""George Bush ... used a signing statement (on a FEMA bill) to say, 'I don't have to follow that, unless I choose to.' "" ""(Bush) used (signing statements) as essentially a form of veto,"" Sen. Hillary Clinton said during a Democratic debate in December 2007. ""He did it through a piece of legislation I passed, where it was pretty simple. I said: 'If you're going to have a FEMA director, it should be somebody with experience handling emergencies.'... And when George Bush signed the bill it was part of, he specifically used a signing statement to say, 'I don't have to follow that, unless I choose to.'''
The legislation Clinton refers to came after the federal government's lackluster response to Hurricane Katrina. Included in a 2006 spending bill for the agency, a new requirement was added that said future Federal Emergency Management Agency directors must have a ""demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management"" and ""not less than five years of executive leadership.""
Bush had appointed Michael ""You're doing a heckuva job, Brownie"" Brown to the top FEMA job in 2003, even though he didn't have much emergency experience. Brown was removed from his position in the poorly managed aftermath of Katrina and the background requirement for future directors was added to FEMA's budget bill.
Essentially, Bush rejected the hiring requirements added to the bill. Choosing to forgo a veto, he interpreted the new law with a ""signing statement,"" something his administration has done to challenge more than 1,100 laws — more than all previous presidents combined. (By comparison, Bush has vetoed seven.) The administration says the statements give Bush the right to ignore parts of the bill he deems unconstitutional, usually when power of the executive branch is at issue.
In this Oct. 4, 2006, signing statement, Bush took exception to the minimum standards for the FEMA director because they ruled out a ""large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill the office.""
Bush said he would ""construe (the qualifications section) in a manner consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution,"" which gives presidents wide authority to make appointments that must be approved by the Senate. It was a formal way of saying Bush believes Congress has no business trying to dictate standards for presidential appointments and that he would ignore them.
So, in effect, Clinton correctly characterized Bush's response to the FEMA minimum standards. He really was saying he wouldn't follow this requirement unless he chose to do so.
But there's a larger context to Bush's refusal.
The Bush administration has defended and expanded the powers of the executive branch. So it's no surprise that he doesn't want Congress meddling in his hiring decisions.
Historically, aside from the occasional scandal (see Teapot Dome, Watergate, Lewinsky), nothing pits the legislative branch against the executive branch more than a president's hiring and firing of personnel.
In 1868, when President Andrew Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, an angry U.S. Congress impeached him. In 1989, Bush's father got acquainted with this tension when he tried to appoint Sen. John Tower as defense secretary. The confirmation hearings got so ugly, reports of Tower's heavy drinking were made public and the Senate ultimately rejected him.
In 1993, Bill Clinton encountered troubles of his own, especially when he tried appointing an attorney general. Janet Reno was his third choice after Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood withdrew during a bruising confirmation process.
So it's through this presidential powers prism that the Bush administration resisted the limit on hiring FEMA's chief.
""The president has the authority to choose which of his subordinate officers he'll rely on,"" White House spokesman Tony Fratto told the
Washington Post
last year. ""The president has the authority to determine what the relationship is between them.""
We're not going to try resolving the constitutional dispute that's raised here. Bush may very well be right. But just because he is, doesn't mean Clinton isn't. Her statement about how Bush viewed the background requirements for a FEMA director is True.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""Teddy Roosevelt first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago."" Not content to emulate Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, Republican icons for whom President Obama has expressed admiration in the past, Obama has aligned himself with a third GOP hero on the issue of health care.
""The problems we face today are a direct consequence of actions that we failed to take yesterday,"" Obama said, opening a health care conference in the East Room of the White House on March 5. ""Since Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform nearly a century ago, we have talked and we have tinkered. We have tried and fallen short, we've stalled for time, and again we have failed to act because of Washington politics or industry lobbying.""
We wondered whether Roosevelt really proposed reform on the scale of the near-universal health care Obama advocates, or if the new president was pushing the whole bipartisan-appeal thing a bit far.
We consulted two well-regarded biographers of Roosevelt, H.W. Brands and Kathleen Dalton. Both confirmed that in 1912, when the former Republican president was running as a Progressive Party candidate for what would have been his third term (after a four-year break), the party advocated national health insurance in its platform .
Health care was the 11th issue listed under ""Social and Industrial Justice,"" after occupational safety, a child labor prohibition, a minimum wage, ""one day's rest in seven"" and other progressive ideas.
""The supreme duty of the Nation is the conservation of human resources through an enlightened measure of social and industrial justice,"" the platform said. ""We pledge ourselves to work unceasingly in State and Nation for ... the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance adapted to American use.""
""What this envisioned was pretty much what FDR accomplished with Social Security, but with health insurance added,"" said Brand, author of
TR: The Last Romantic
(1998).
""We don’t know the specifics of the plan,"" said Dalton, author of
Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life
(2002). ""The roots were probably British, though he knew about German health insurance.""
Dalton said unequivocally Obama was on solid ground evoking Roosevelt. Brands more or less agreed, though he cautioned that health care was ""not the priority that trust-busting or conservation was"" for Roosevelt. ""It's worth remembering that health care was a far smaller concern in those days,"" Brands said. ""Doctors had few medicines, and most people died or got better on their own. The biggest issues were public health — eradicating malaria, cleaning up water supplies, and so on.""
In
Healthcare Reform in America: A Reference Handbook
(2004), Jennie Kronenfeld, a sociology professor at Arizona State University, writes that ""this was the first inclusion of a health insurance plank in any national platform with a major candidate, although the Socialist Party had endorsed a compulsory system as early as 1904.""
Roosevelt and the Progressives, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party, lost the election to Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Party candidate. Republican William Taft finished third.
Clearly, Obama is on solid ground tracing the push for national health care back to Theodore Roosevelt.",1,Barack Obama
"He's been endorsed by ""every major newspaper here in the state of Texas."" At the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama responded to criticism that he was little more than a good speaker by saying that he had broad support from voters and newspapers.
He said he has received many endorsements, ""including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.""
He's right. We checked and found he has been endorsed in the primary race against Sen. Hillary Clinton by the seven largest newspapers in Texas. Here are samples of what they said:
Houston Chronicle:
""Obama vows to reach out to independents and Republicans with a message of inclusion and cooperation. He offers a historic opportunity to elevate national political dialogue to a higher ground. Those who insist on vitriol and obstructionism would be marginalized.""
Dallas Morning News:
""Americans are tired of divisive, hard-edged politics. Democrats would inspire a refreshingly new approach by choosing Mr. Obama as their 2008 candidate.""
Austin American-Statesman:
""His optimism, unifying vision and ability to inspire are the kind of healing balm the country needs at this moment in history.""
San Antonio Express-News:
""America needs a president that tries to create unity out of diversity, marshalling all the forces — red, blue or purple — that make this country great.
Sen. Barack Obama is the Democratic candidate that offers the best chance to reach that lofty objective.""
Fort Worth Star-Telegram:
""Obama might be shorter on detail, but he is by far longer on inspirational spirit, charisma and an ability to energize previously unengaged Americans in the voting process, particularly the usually unengaged up-and-coming generations on whose shoulders America's future rests.""
Corpus Christi Caller-Times:
""The Editorial Board endorses Sen. Barack Obama because it believes that he offers the kind of inspirational leadership the country is hungry for.""
El Paso Times:
""A weary America, tired of the status quo, fed up with business as usual, is longing for a positive change — and Barack Obama is that change.""",1,Barack Obama
"""He (Obama) chairs the subcommittee on Europe. ... He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight."" In one of the more pointed barbs in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate, Sen. Hillary Clinton charged that Sen. Barack Obama has been so busy running for president that he hasn't done much of anything as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs.
""I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee,"" Clinton said. ""He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.""
Obama responded: ""Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.""
Although Obama acknowledges the point, we sought to confirm what the subcommittee has been doing.
Congressional records show, and spokesmen for several subcommittee members confirm, the subcommittee has not held any policy hearings since Obama was appointed chair in early 2007.
The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes ""all matters, policies and problems concerning the continent of Europe, including the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.""
The chair sets the agenda for a subcommittee and Obama could have asked to hold a hearing on NATO and its role in Afghanistan.
But Clinton's claim, while technically true, is unfair, said Andrew J. Fischer, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Richard Lugar. Lugar now serves as a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he was the chair, from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. He is the ranking Republican on the committee.
Fischer, who is a minority staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee.
In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Afghanistan on Jan. 31, 2008, and NATO was a part of the discussion. Obama attended a Democratic debate in California that day. Clinton is not on the committee.
The Clinton campaign put out a statement reiterating Clinton's comments to reinforce the theme that Obama is more about talk than action.
""Given the opportunity to take the reins of leadership and shape two critical areas of U.S. foreign policy — Afghanistan and our alliances in Europe — Senator Obama has done next to nothing,"" the statement said.
Obama's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
So let's look at Clinton's statement:
""He chairs the subcommittee on Europe."" Yep.
""It has jurisdiction over NATO."" Yep.
""NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan."" Yep.
Some may argue that the issue of NATO's role in Afghanistan typically and more appropriately would come before the full Foreign Relations Committee. But Clinton is right when she says Obama's subcommittee has been largely dormant while Obama has campaigned for president.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Mitt Romney suggested that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."" President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, ""the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.""
That sounded like a request for some fact-checking.
So, was Obama totally wrong?
The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women.
Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , then said:
""Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. For example, their health care. You know a major difference in this campaign is that Gov. Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
""I think that's a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family's pocket. Gov. Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""
Romney later responded:
""I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.""
It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees’ insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.
For this fact-check, we’re asking whether Romney has suggested that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""
The Blunt amendment
Obama’s support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.
Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obama’s health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.
In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their ""beliefs or moral convictions."" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.
A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer ""Of course I support the Blunt amendment.""
CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.
""Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a ‘moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization’ will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?""
Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: ""Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety."" In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, ""As president, I will abolish it.""
So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employer’s ability to decline to provide a service that goes against ""beliefs or moral convictions,"" that means he supports employers making ""the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""
Romney’s response
We asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obama’s claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul:
""Gov. Romney’s statement speaks for itself. He does not believe that bureaucrats in Washington or employers should tell a woman whether she can use contraceptives, and no policy that he has proposed or supported would do so. To the contrary, he has repeatedly made clear that he believes all women should have access to contraception and make such personal choices themselves. The disagreement between the governor and President Obama on this issue is over whether the federal government should impose a nationwide insurance mandate for contraception. The president wants bureaucrats to make that decision for all Americans, even where it violates their religious liberty. Gov. Romney does not.""
The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.
(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage , though we’re not sure how many had religious exceptions.)",1,Barack Obama
"John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis. Barack Obama promoted his record on the economy and attacked John McCain's policies in a speech in Golden, Colo., on Sept. 16, 2008, the day after the stock market reeled on news of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
""Last September, I stood up at Nasdaq and said it's time to realize that we are in this together — that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street — and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets,"" Obama said. ""Months later, Sen. McCain told a newspaper that he'd love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, 'but' — he said — 'I don't know one.'""
Obama did give a speech at Nasdaq on Sept. 17, 2007, in which he talked about the mortgage crisis and how it could affect both homeowners and Wall Street. He proposed several ways that the government could regulate markets more effectively. So that part of his statement is true.
We wanted to know if McCain said that he ""didn't know"" of a solution to the mortgage crisis, as Obama said, and to see if McCain's remarks were taken in context.
The source for that claim is a videotaped interview McCain gave to the
Keene
(N.H.)
Sentinel
on Dec. 4, 2007.
In McCain's defense, it should be noted that at that time, the larger topic of debate was how to help homeowners losing their homes to foreclosure. The crisis in the financial industry then was a lesser, though still serious, concern. When McCain was speaking with the
Sentinel
board, the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns was still more than four months in the future.
In the interview, McCain disparaged speculators who contributed to bad loans, but his comments focused on how to help homeowners meet their house payments and stay out of foreclosure. McCain specifically mentioned creating a simplified form for mortgages so loan applicants could more easily understand the terms of their mortgages.
""In an ideal world, we'd have enough people to go case-by-case and say, okay, you can go back to your previous interest rate, and you can't,"" McCain said. ""But, my God, we're talking about hundreds of thousands, if not millions (of homeowners) and how long would that take? Meanwhile, people are suffering very badly.""
""I don't know how bad it's going to get, and obviously the worse it gets, then, the more there is a role for goverment,"" McCain added. ""But I can't come down yet and give you a specific solution, because I don't claim to be smart enough, but I do have some confidence in (Treasury Secretary Henry) Paulson and I'm glad to see him more and more active in this issue. I'd love to give you a solution, but I don't know.""
He also said he he relies on his advisers and other ""smart people"" to keep him up to speed on economic matters.
Let's stipulate that this interview does not showcase McCain at his best on issues of the economy and finance. But Obama's statement that McCain said he ""didn't know"" of a solution to the mortgage crisis appears to be accurate given the full context of the interview.",1,Barack Obama
"""Fidel (Castro) has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me."" Florida is a swing state, and in Florida, Cuban-Americans are a swing constituency.
By and large, Cuban-Americans don’t like Fidel Castro. And Castro, it seems, doesn’t much like Sen. John McCain.
So it comes as little surprise that McCain would wear Castro’s disdain like a badge of honor in an interview with a Spanish-language radio station in Miami on Oct. 29, 2008.
""I notice in the past couple of days that Fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me,"" McCain said. ""My feelings are hurt.""
How’s this for unkind words? In an Oct. 11, 2008, commentary published in Cuban state newspapers, and translated by Granma Internacional, Castro says McCain ""cultivates his reputation as a belligerent man"" and ""was one of the worst students in his class at West Point.""
""He has confessed that he knows nothing about Mathematics, and presumably far less about complicated economic sciences,"" Castro states. ""There is no doubt that his rival surpasses him in intelligence and serenity.""
Castro doesn’t seem to think much of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin either, and he warns that due to McCain’s age ""his health is not at all secure.""
""I mention this information to indicate the eventual possibility — if anything should happen in terms of the candidate’s health, given that he is elected — of the rifle lady, the inexperienced former governor of Alaska, becoming president of the United States,"" Castro states. ""It is obvious that she knows nothing about anything.""
While Castro stops short of supporting either candidate, he seems to pay Obama the most backhanded of compliments, saying, ""It’s a miracle that the Democratic candidate has not met the same fate as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and others who dreamed of justice and equality in recent decades.""
Earlier this summer, we took a look at an e-mail from the Republican Party of Florida (which claimed it was a joke) that carried the headline, ""Fidel Castro endorses Obama,"" and included a doctored image of Castro holding a poster of Obama. Above Castro were the words, ""I love this guy!"" We ruled that one Pants on Fire .
A link in the e-mail went to another Castro commentary published in a Communist newspaper on May 26, 2008. In it, Castro says Obama is ""doubtless, from the social and human points of view, the most progressive candidate to the U.S. presidency."" Castro also praises Obama’s ""great intelligence, his debating skills and work ethic."" But it amounts to lesser-of-two-evils praise, at best. For example, Castro later calls the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain ""an act of genocide.""
Stated Castro: ""Presidential candidate Obama’s speech may be formulated as follows: hunger for the nation, remittances as charitable handouts and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it.""
Castro also clearly understood that any praise for Obama would provide fodder for his opponents.
""I feel no resentment towards him (Obama), for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity,"" Castro said then. ""Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor. I have therefore no reservations about criticizing him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly.""
But back to McCain’s statement. That Castro had ""unkind things to say"" about McCain is clear. Our issue is whether Castro ""made his preferences known in the campaign."" Castro stops short of endorsing one candidate or the other. But we think the tone of Castro’s statements leaves little doubt he prefers Obama. For whatever that’s worth. We rule McCain’s statement True.",1,John McCain
"""Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square here. And the family legend is that he is a distant cousin of mine."" In a packed town hall in Springfield, Mo., Sen. Barack Obama laid down the challenge for a duel.
His eyes weren't exactly squinting. And theme music to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly could not be heard. But the gauntlet was dropped.
""I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes,"" Obama said. ""Right here. Right now.""
Then Obama surprised the crowd.
""I don't know if people are aware of the fact,"" Obama said, ""but the family legend is that Wild Bill Hickok, he's a distant cousin of mine.""
The crowd roared with laughter. It seemed that perhaps the sun had gotten to him.
""I'm serious, I'm serious,"" Obama said. ""I don't know if it's true, but that's the family legend. But we're going to research that.""
No need, Sen. Obama. We called the New England Historic Genealogical Society. These are the folks who back in March released the study that found that Obama is a distant relative of actor Brad Pitt (ninth cousins, to be exact).
Chris Child, a staff genealogist, compared geneological charts for Obama and Hickok and...bang...there it was. The two trees intersected with one Thomas Blossom of Holland, who arrived in Plymouth, Mass., in 1629.
The two are sixth cousins six times removed, Child said. Whatever that means.
Seems quite a length for Obama to go to support a metaphor about dueling with your opponent over taxes, but then Hickok was also a noted gambler.
Obama also said that Hickok, the legendary frontier lawman, had his first duel in Springfield, Mo. While we were digging we looked that up, too. And Obama is right again. While it's hard for many historians to separate fact from legend, it is documented that James Butler Hickok (his name wasn't even William) got the better of former Confederate Army soldier Davis Tutt in a 1865 ""quick draw"" duel after a dispute involving gambling debts and, you guessed it, a woman.
In the ensuing years, Hickok boasted of killing more than 100 men. Though in his defense, he said they all had it coming.
Hickok got his in 1876 after he apparently broke the cardinal rule of gunfighters: He sat with his back to the door and was shot from behind while playing poker at a saloon in Deadwood, S.D. The story  was that he was holding two pairs, aces and eights — hence the term ""dead man's hand"" still used today.
The relation to ""Wild Bill"" Hickok is way cooler than the revelations earlier this year that Obama is distantly related to none other than vice president Dick Cheney. Undoubtedly, Obama took a lot of ribbing over that. Maybe those jokesters ought to sleep with one eye open because Obama's ""family legend"" is correct. We rule the statement True.",1,Barack Obama
"""Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month."" The cost of the Iraq war has often been expressed in billions or trillions, numbers so big and abstract they remind us of Carl Sagan's description of the universe (""billions and billions of stars…"").
The candidates have cited alternative uses for the war money, saying it would have been better spent on health coverage for the uninsured (Sen. Hillary Clinton) or on more school teachers (Sen. Barack Obama).
In a speech on March 20, 2008, Obama took a different approach and emphasized the personal cost of the war.
""When Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month, you're paying a price for this war,"" he said in the speech in Charleston, W.Va.
At $100 per month, the war cost to each U.S. household would be more than cable TV (average bill: $58), but less than a car payment (average bill: $400-500).
We asked the Obama campaign about the source of the $100 figure and were told it came from The Three Trillion Dollar War, a new book by Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Linda J. Bilmes, a former Commerce Department official from the Clinton administration who is now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
The book says the monthly operating cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is about $16-billion.
""To think of it another way,"" the book says, ""roughly every American household is spending $138 per month on the current operating costs of the wars, with a little more than $100 per month going to Iraq alone.""
(Of course, Obama's simplified analysis does not reflect the variations in income tax levels. And you don't have to write a check for the war each month. The war costs are included in government spending that is paid for by taxes.)
There was no footnote for the $100 estimate, so we called Bilmes to ask how she had calculated it. She said they took the Bush administration's 2008 request for war funding – $196-billion – and divided it by 12 to get a monthly cost. That works out to $16-billlion for both wars and about $12-billion just for the Iraq portion.
Then, she and Stiglitz divided those figures by the number of U.S. households and came up with $138 for both wars and slightly more than $100 for Iraq alone, she said.
We double-checked the authors' sources and math, and found they were right.
Indeed, the Bush administration request for 2008 was $196-billion for both wars, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A recent Census Bureau report said there were 116-million households. So that works out to about $140 per month for both wars and about $114 for Iraq alone. (Our numbers are slightly higher than Bilmes and Stiglitz because we used the latest estimates from CRS and a newer and slighter higher count for households.)
To verify the Bilmes and Stiglitz calculation, we checked with Steven Kosiak, vice president for budget studies with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on defense issues. He said their methodology was correct and that the number ""sounds about right.""
Bilmes, a Democrat who is neutral in the presidental race, said Obama could have used an even higher figure if he had included other war costs that aren't in the Pentagon's $196-billion tab. These include disability payments, the cost of replacing war-fighting equipment and interest on the borrowed money.
By using the figure he did, Obama ""really was being conservative on this,"" Bilmes said. ""He's not overstating it in any way.""",1,Barack Obama
"Other Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies. President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he plans to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule, which prevents openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military.
But so far, no go.
Meet the Press
host David Gregory asked Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate's Armed Services Committee, whether Obama would follow through on his promise.
""I think he will and he can,"" Levin said on the program on Oct. 11, 2009. ""I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully.""
Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — community, stating that, as president, he would ""bring about real change for all LGBT Americans."" Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration.
That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo ""don't ask, don't tell"" — it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a Stalled on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy.
The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: ""I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy.""
Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military.
Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada.
Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members.
All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France.
So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly. We give him a True.",1,Carl Levin
"""I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."" In a race where his opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has touted ""35 years of experience"" over and over, Sen. Barack Obama has begun to cite his own experience of 20 years.
At a debate in Cleveland, moderator Brian Williams asked Obama to respond to Clinton's charges that he was heavy on oratory and light on action. Obama responded:
""You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service.""
The voters will decide if the lesser number is significant, but we find Obama's claim of two decades' experience to be accurate.
To arrive at this number, we looked closely at Obama's official congressional biography, his professional resume and news articles chronicling his political rise in Illinois.
If Obama wins election and takes office in January 2009, he will have served four years in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois.
Before that, he was a state senator in Illinois for eight years. He also was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school during that time.
His schedule from the school shows him teaching two or three classes in the fall and winter terms — usually Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process; Voting Rights and the Democratic Process; and Current Issues in Racism and the Law. In the spring, he would attend the Illinois legislative sessions. It seems a fairly safe bet that, like most legislators, his constituent work — fielding phone calls and helping people in his district — went on year round. Press reports indicate he did a small amount of private law practice during the summer. So that's eight years as a public official in Illinois, bringing our total to 12 years.
To get to 20 years of experience, we still need eight years from Obama's career prior to holding public office. Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983. He worked for a year as a financial analyst; in his memoir he said he spent his days behind a computer terminal, ""checking the Reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages across the globe"" and feeling like ""a spy behind enemy lines."" He gave up that job to go into community organizing, work he felt was more important politically. He worked three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. We won't count the junior-level business experience as working ""on behalf of families who are having a hard time,"" but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill. That brings his work experience to 15 years.
At Harvard, Obama began to receive national attention. He became the first black president of the
Harvard Law Review
and was recruited heavily by law firms around the country. (He met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, as a summer associate at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin.)
He graduated in 1991. He ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992, and then accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. The firm specialized in political and civil rights work and neighborhood economic development work. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993. He was elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and took office in 1997, so his full-time work after law school comprises five years. That gets us to 20 years.
(During these years, Obama also worked on his career as an author. His memoir Dreams from my Father was published in 1994 and reprinted after his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. A follow-up, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream , was published in 2006. His personal financial disclosure statements show that those books earned him $1.8-million in 2005 and 2006, the majority of his income.)
The other part of Obama's claim is that his experience is ""on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."" We take that to mean his experience is broadly in the field of public service, and that too is an accurate claim. The bulk of Obama's professional experience is either in elected office or working for a nonprofit, a university or a civil rights law firm.
Obama's 20 years of experience are 15 years short of Clinton's, but it's worth noting that Obama is 14 years younger than Clinton.",1,Barack Obama
"Newt Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming."" With just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, a new ad from a pro-Mitt Romney ""Super PAC"" is attacking Republican presidential front-runner Newt Gingrich over ""a ton of baggage"" from his past.
""Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich,"" a voice says as images of Gingrich flash on the screen, interspersed with damning headlines. ""Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.""
The ad , airing in December 2011 in Florida and Iowa, is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by many supporters of Mitt Romney .
It goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""
The source
The ad cites the website Newtfacts.com , which lays out a list of -- you guessed it -- more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one:
""Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming,"" followed by a link .
In that now-famous ad, Gingrich sits on a couch next to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House.
""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says.
""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.""
Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.""
Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.""
The ad then directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this.""
About Al Gore
The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization called the Alliance for Climate Protection that aims to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. It’s now known as the Climate Reality Project.
WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org .
""It is guided by one simple truth: The climate crisis is real and we know how to solve it,"" the site says. The group claims 5 million members worldwide.
In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore mentioned that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi and Gingrich agreed. It was part of a larger campaign featuring ""'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,"" according to a 2008 story in the San Francisco Chronicle.
What they’re saying now
Gingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad.
The Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to "" answering the attacks ."" In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was ""probably the dumbest single thing I’ve ever done.""
It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling.
In the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich’s change of heart.
""I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don’t want to be ungracious now. I’m grateful that he did it, and I’m sorry that he’s changed his position,"" Gore said.",1,Restore Our Future
"Barack Obama voted against ""born alive"" legislation in Illinois that was ""virtually identical to the federal law."" The hot-button issue of abortion is the subject of two recent political ads and a controversy centering on Barack Obama's votes in the Illinois legislature.
An independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, launched an attack ad on Obama, and the Obama campaign responded with an attack on John McCain's abortion record. For more on these dueling ads, read our story here.
As the controversy around the ads played out, the National Right to Life Committee disputed some of Obama's public comments about Illinois legislation concerning infants ""born alive,"" particularly a crucial bit of the legislation that became known as the ""neutrality clause."" The committee said the legislation had a neutrality clause; Obama said it didn't.
Here's the background: Opponents of abortion put forward legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003 intended to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is ""born alive"" and ""shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law.""
The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions.
Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care.
We'll state at the outset here that Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the ""born alive"" laws every time they came up, and this is not disputed. Why he opposed the legislation has become a controversial point during the presidential campaign, however.
The controversy hinges on how the two sides interpret the ""neutrality clause.""
In 2002, two years before Obama was elected to the Senate, the U.S. Congress took up its own version of ""born alive"" legislation, and passed it with a so-called ""neutrality clause,"" which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being ""born alive."" Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws.
Obama has said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had had a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story.
The National Right to Life Committee says the 2003 bill did have a neutrality clause, and contends that Obama is misrepresenting the bill. David Brody of CBN News, a Christian news group, asked Obama for his response to that in August 2008.
""I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying,"" Obama said. ""I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion."" Read his entire answer on the CBN Web site .
We requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life said. The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here .
The records are from the Health and Human Services Committee. They show that on March 12, 2003, the committee voted unanimously to add a neutrality clause to the ""born alive"" bill. Then the committee voted down the bill on a 6-4 vote. All the Democrats on the committee, including Obama, voted against the legislation, while the Republicans favored it.
But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation.
Let's compare the language of the various neutrality clauses.
The federal born alive legislation has passed and was the law at the time of the 2003 vote. Here's what its neutrality clause states:
""Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being ‘born alive’ as defined in this section.""
The 2003 amendment that was before the Illinois Senate committee said this:
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this Section.""
Except for minor punctuation, the clauses are identical.
But here's the neutrality clause that was included in the successful Illinois ""born alive"" legislation of 2005. Note that it has two additional paragraphs.
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive, as defined in this Section.""
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect existing federal or State law regarding abortion.""
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter generally accepted medical standards.""
So the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 legislation did have a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation. But the federal neutrality clause wasn't sufficient to reassure the Illinois legislators seeking to protect abortion rights. The law that passed had additional explicit protection for existing state law and generally accepted medical standards. The bill's sponsor said in 2008 that the extra language was included to satisfy ""the most zealous prochoice legislators.""
But the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 version of the law did include a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation, and Obama voted against it. We rule its claim True.",1,National Right to Life Committee
"""I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn."" Former U.S. Sen. Mike Gravel, 77, returned from oblivion to a momentary spot on the national stage when he announced March 26, 2008, that he had joined the Libertarian Party. But the central question of his candidacy — is it one? — remained.
Earlier that month he put a video on YouTube complaining that the site's YouChoose page no longer featured him. ""Apparently I've been relegated to a footnote at YouTube,"" Gravel says in the video. ""I'm one of three candidates in the presidential race, Obama, Hillary and myself. I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn.""
PolitiFact set out to confirm Gravel's status. We started by checking to see if Gravel was on the ballot in any of the upcoming Democratic nominating contests. Some state officials had no idea who we were asking about.
""Could you spell that?"" asked Bowen Greenwood, communications director for the secretary of state of Montana (primary, June 3). Greenwood went to check and came back with: ""The elections folks tell me they've never heard of him. I confess, I've never heard of him either.""
West Virginia (May 13) had not heard from him. Neither had South Dakota (June 3). Puerto Rico (June 1) was finalizing its candidate list, but didn't expect Gravel to be on it.
And in Guam (May 3), Tony Charfauros, chairman of the Democratic Party, said: ""Are you talking about Mike Gravel who used to be a candidate for president?""
Gravel told us he's on the ballot in North Carolina (May 6) and Oregon (May 20). Turns out he is confirmed for the North Carolina primary, but not Oregon.
Scott Moore, chief of communications for the Oregon secretary of state, told us they would have been happy to put Gravel on the ballot, but his campaign never filed the paperwork.
He's also not on the ballot in Pennsylvania (April 22), Indiana (May 6) or Kentucky (May 20).
Adding it all up, Gravel is on the ballot in just one of the 10 remaining contests.
We also determined that Gravel has zero delegates, virtually no fundraising and a campaign staff that amounts to ""the better part of about a half dozen people,"" according to deputy campaign manager Jon Kraus.
So, is Gravel still a candidate?
He is. Just not for the Democrats.
Gravel said he ""has pretty much had it"" with the Democrats and thinks they have cut their ties to him. Yet he's intent on being on the November ballot one way or another.
In fact, he hopes to seal the deal in Denver. But not at the Democratic convention.
At the Libertarian convention — May 22-26, 2008.
""Right now he's actively pursuing the Libertarian nomination,"" Kraus said.",1,Mike Gravel
"The Republican leadership's budget proposal ""doesn't contain any numbers."" The back and forth over President Barack Obama's budget has gone like this: Republicans say it's big and costly and will saddle future generations with too much debt. Obama complains the Republicans are the party of ""no"" and don't have their own plan. Republicans finally release their own plan.
""The Republican Road to Recovery"" is a 19-page document released March 26 that includes sections on curbing spending, creating jobs, lowering taxes and controlling debt.
But it came under quick criticism from White House officials who said it was remarkably short on specifics — so much, in fact, that it doesn’t contain actual numbers about how much the Republicans would spend on various areas of the government.
""It's interesting to have a budget that doesn't contain any numbers. I think the party of 'no' has become the party of 'no new ideas,' "" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs.
""I think the administration is glad that the Republicans heard the president's call to submit an alternative. We just hope that next time it will contain actual numbers so somebody can evaluate what it means,"" he added.
A reporter asked him if wasn't being a little snarky there.
""I think if I intoned to you that I would produce a 20-page document that outlined my budget priorities, that it might actually contain a chart with some numbers. I don't think that's a whole lot to ask,"" Gibbs answered.
We were curious if Gibbs was right that the Republican budget outline contained no numbers, or if he was just being snarky. So we downloaded the Republican document and read it.
We found Gibbs is right. It's a budget proposal without proposing actual numbers.
It's not very long, and you might even want to read it for yourself . But if you don't want to, here's our quick summary:
•  Spending: The Republican plan says the Obama budget spends too much and is ""reckless."" The Republicans say they would undo wasteful spending from recent legislation such as the economic stimulus bill and the omnibus spending bill for this year. But they don't specify what programs or how much. The Republican plan also says it would ""cut overall nondefense spending by reforming or eliminating a host of wasteful programs deemed ineffective by various government entities."" So what programs and how much? The plan doesn't say.
•  Lowering taxes and creating jobs: In a rare moment of specificity, the Republican plan says it would rewrite the tax code so that people making up to $100,000 would be taxed at a marginal rate of 10 percent and everyone above that would be taxed 25 percent. Fair enough. So how much would that cost? The plan doesn't say. It offers a few other tax-cutting ideas — tax deductions for businesses and an overall vow to keep the Bush tax cuts — but again there are no estimates about the impact on revenues.
•  Controlling debt: The Republican plan says it will control debt by ending spending on bailouts for Wall Street. For a savings of ... hmm, doesn't say. The plan also opposes runaway inflation and promotes keeping the cost of living low for families and entrepreneurs. Sounds great! What that means for the federal budget, we couldn't tell you.
Now, we should note that the Republican document has some numbers in it. But they're numbers about Obama's budget, used to illustrate the party's complaints, under labels like ""Future Debt Burden"" and ""Expanding the Size of Government.""
What the Republican plan lacks is the numbers that really matter, numbers that would show how much the Republicans propose to spend on various parts of government.
There are many pressing questions in the public debate that an alternative budget could answer. For example, if we're going want to cut wasteful spending, what programs should be cut? Also, what will cutting taxes do to deficit projections in years to come? But the Republican plan doesn't provide any answers.
The Republican House leaders said they will be releasing more data next week. Perhaps that will include some numbers. But Gibbs was right. The first version of the ""Republican Road to Recovery"" is a budget without budget numbers.",1,Robert Gibbs
"""Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists."" If you were wondering how Washington works, an ad from the Barack Obama campaign ostensibly offers a primer – ""A Guide to Understanding Washington Lobbyists"" — while it attacks Hillary Clinton.
The Web-only ad outlines the following steps with on-screen text:
Step 1: ""Lobbyists donate to politicians.""
Step 2: ""Politicians defend lobbyists.""
Step 3: ""Americans pay the price.""
As part of the first step, the ad states:
""Senator Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists, more money than any other candidate — Republican or Democrat:
* Over $130,000 from energy lobbyists
* Over $130,000 from drug company lobbyists
* Over $125,000 from health care and insurance lobbyists.""
We asked the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which categorizes and analyzes political contributions, whether this text was accurate.
The $800,000 number is correct. A recent analysis by the center showed Clinton has accepted $865,290 from lobbyists, based on data released on March 20, 2008.
The threshold of contributions by industry the ad lists for Clinton is probably too low, said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the center.
The center's analysis found the following amounts that lobbyists gave to Clinton:
* Energy: $442,800
* Pharmaceuticals/health products: $450,450
* Hospitals, health services/HMOs and insurance companies: $552,050
* Health professionals: $114,755.",1,Barack Obama
"A request for ""an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House (during the presidency of George W. Bush), including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs fired back at former Vice President Dick Cheney the day after Cheney said President Barack Obama ""seems afraid to make a decision"" about a general's public plea for 40,000 more U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
""The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger,"" Cheney said in a speech at the Center for Security Policy on Oct. 21.
In his daily press briefing the next day, Gibbs said Cheney's comments were ""curious"" given that ""the vice president was for seven years not focused on Afghanistan.""
And, Gibbs said, the comments were ""even more curious given the fact that (a request for) an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House, including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March.""
Gibbs is referring here to a request for additional troops made by the previous top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, during President George W. Bush's final year in office.
McKiernan made his requests public in a press conference in September 2008 in Afghanistan, saying he needed at least three more combat brigades, in addition to the one Bush had promised in January. He said more soldiers and resources were needed to stabilize insurgencies in Afghanistan.
""The danger is that we'll be here longer and we'll expend more resources and experience more human suffering than if we had more resources placed against this campaign sooner,"" McKiernan told reporters.
""The additional military capabilities that have been asked for are needed as quickly as possible,"" he said.
McKiernan said then that the Pentagon validated his formal request for additional troops, and that his request dated back to when he replaced his predecessor four months prior.
In a news briefing at the Pentagon on Oct. 1, 2008, McKiernan reiterated his call for more troops — ""the level of effort needs to be increased"" — and said he was hoping to see a shift of assets from Iraq to Afghanistan.
""I know that's a choice that has to be made here in Washington,"" he said.
""I think there's a common view that we need to do more; that Afghanistan has been an economy of force for the last several years,"" McKiernan said.
On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 17,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
According to a story in the
Baltimore Sun
on Feb. 18, 2009, ""The deployment is Obama's response to a long-standing request from commanders in Afghanistan for more troops. The commanders have sought four more combat brigades, aviation units and other support, representing an increase of more than 20,000 troops.""
In a March speech outlining a new strategy for the war there, Obama said that ""for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq.""
Obama then seemed to take a swipe at the Bush administration when he added that he ordered the additional troops to satisfy a request that came from Gen. McKiernan ""for many months.""
The public doesn't have access to McKiernan's formal request for more troops. But we know that he was talking about it publicly in September 2008, at least 4 1/2 months before the end of Bush's term. And McKiernan told reporters his request went back nearly to the start of his taking over as the top U.S. commander four months before that. That would suggest Gibbs' claim is correct that it had been sitting on desks in the White House for eight months. And so we rule his statement True.",1,Robert Gibbs
"Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor."" Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore has a new film coming out —
Capitalism: A Love Story
— and he appeared on Comedy Central's
The Colbert Report
to promote it.
The show's ironically conservative host, Stephen Colbert, defended capitalism and the bailouts of late 2008, which led to a mock debate between them.
At first, Wall Street was actually angry about the bailouts, Colbert claimed. ""Because it might come with strings attached,"" he explained. ""But they forgave Obama when he didn't add any. Now all is forgiven.""
""That's why you like Obama so much now?"" Moore asked.
""I don't like Obama so much,"" Colbert said. ""On this, I do. And your film is helping me like Obama, because you're a critic of his. You think he's in the pocket of guys like Goldman Sachs.""
""I point out in the film that Goldman Sachs is his No. 1 private contributor,"" Moore answered. ""But I voted for the guy. I'm still hopeful that he's going to do the right thing and side with us, and not Wall Street. But the jury's out on that.""
We'll let you draw your own conclusions on their debate. We wanted to check Moore's statement about Obama's contributors and the financial services firm Goldman Sachs.
Obama made a big deal during the election that he didn't accept money from federal political action committees or lobbyists.
But laws require individuals  to disclose their occupation and their employer when they donate to federal political candidates. We checked with the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data. Their numbers include contributions from employees and their immediate families.
Their analysis of the 2008 presidential campaign found that University of California employees were Obama's top donor, giving a collective $1.6 million. That system is run by the state of California, and hence is a public employer.
No. 2 was Goldman Sachs. Goldman employees gave Obama $994,795.
Obama's next biggest donors were the employees of Harvard University, Microsoft, Google, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase,  Time Warner, the law firm Sidley Austin, and Stanford University. View Obama's complete list and amounts here. Incidentally, Goldman Sachs ranked No.4 on John McCain's list of employee contributions, at $230,095.
Moore said that Goldman Sachs is Obama's ""No. 1 private contributor."" The data shows that is correct.",1,Michael Moore
"""98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000"" and would not see a tax increase under Barack Obama's plan. During the final presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., Barack Obama and John McCain got into an argument about Joe the Plumber.
McCain said Joe would get a bigger tax bill under the Obama tax plan. Obama defended himself by saying that ""98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000"" and would not see a tax increase under the Obama plan.
Joe the Plumber is an actual person: Joe Wurzelbacher, who met Obama during a campaign stop a few days before the debate in Toledo, Ohio.
""I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes about $250,000, $270,000, $280,000 a year,"" he told Obama. ""Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?""
Obama said yes, it would --see their entire conversation on YouTube -- but Obama defended his tax policy as being good for people who are struggling.
""It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too,"" Obama said.
During the debate, John McCain mentioned Joe the Plumber at least a dozen times as the kind of small business owner who would pay more taxes under Obama's plans.
It's not clear from the exchange just what Joe means when he says the business ""makes"" up to $280,000 a year. Is he talking about total revenue? Profits? That's an important point here and it's one that Obama and Joe the Plumber never discussed. Based on Obama's proposals and current tax policy, for Joe's taxes to rise Joe would have to ""make"" $250,000 in net profit, after deducting all his expenses: his employees' pay, his supplies, his truck, his fuel costs, and other legitimate business expenses. He'd have to be an extremely successful plumber.
In response to McCain's statements during the debate, Obama said only 2 percent of small businesses would be subject to the tax.
It seems likely that Obama is right, according to data and an analysis from the experts at the Tax Policy Center.
Obama's plan is to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the top two tax brackets. In practice, this means that people with income above $200,000 for single people and $250,000 for couples would see taxes increase.
Now what does this mean for small businesses? It's not as easy as you might think to identify small businesses via the tax code. But there are several typical ways that small business owners pay their taxes, usually by declaring business income on their individual tax returns. Many people who declare business income are small businesses, though the group also includes professionals like lawyers, authors, or public speakers.
Looking at all the tax filers who report any business income at all, the Tax Policy Center confirms that about 2 percent will see their taxes increase under Obama's plan.
In an effort to focus more effectively on small business owners, the Tax Policy Center did an additional analysis where they looked at people who reported business income that accounted for at least 50 percent of their income. This means people who derive a significant living off their business income.
In 2007, about 2 percent of those tax filers would have made enough money to see a tax increase under Obama's plans.
There is a small bit of uncertainty in the best data available; it includes some people who we would not think of as traditional small business owners. But still, Obama's statement during the debate that ""98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000"" matches the findings of a respected, non-partisan group of tax analysts.",1,Barack Obama
"Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on a taxpayer protection pledge. On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.
For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on signing a taxpayer protection pledge. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.
Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:
Screen text: Will not sign pledge
Audio of Candy Crowley : ""Republican Mitt Romney says he will not sign a no-new-taxes pledge.""
Screen text: Then he did
Audio from Romney radio ad: ""I’m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge.""
The first clip refers to an announcement during Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign that he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group.
Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news:
""In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge,"" the newspaper wrote. ""Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing.""
The article went on to quote Romney saying, ""I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues.""
The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. ""I'm against tax increases,"" Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. ""But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth.""
Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. ""He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges,"" she suggested to the Globe.
Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted then Romney deputy campaign manager Eric Fehrnstrom saying, ""Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear.""
In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge ""government by gimmickry,"" the newspaper reported.
Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general.
Now we’ll fast-forward a few years, when Romney, having finished a term as governor of Massachusetts, was running for president. On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate for the 2008 election to sign a taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.
""In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,"" Norquist said in a news release . ""Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests.""
Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. That’s where the DNC got the clip used in its ad.
""For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,"" Romney said in the ad. ""I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and when you die. That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board. And savings? When I'm president, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero. I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor. I'll roll back taxes as president.""
In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate.
It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.
The Massachusetts text is a ""pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.""
The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.""
Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements.",1,Democratic National Committee
"""Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal 'supermax' prisons."" In a speech defending his plans for the detainess at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, President Barack Obama said Americans should not be concerned about them being transferred to the United States because federal prisons are secure.
""Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders — highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety,"" Obama said. ""Bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal '
supermax
' prisons.""
First, we should note that Obama's comment suggests there is more than one federal
""supermax
"" facility. But there's actually just one, the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states have built their own maximum security prisons, but it's clear Obama was referring to federal facilities because they would be the ones to house the suspected terrorists.
The security of the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" as the Florence prison is known among correctional program professionals, has been cited frequently by Democrats as lawmakers and the administration battle over where to relocate the detainees. Obama is seeking to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010.
Many Republicans believe it should remain open, and many Democrats have also grown wary. A bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked funding to close the facility until Obama comes up with a more detailed plan on what would happen to the detainees.
Meanwhile, some Senate Democrats, including Assistant Majority Leader Richard
Durbin
and California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein
, have suggested that
a supermax
prison is the best place to house the suspected terrorists.
As you might expect, living is austere at the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Prisoners are kept in small cells and have limited contact with others. Florence is already home to several widely known international and domestic terrorists, including the ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid, and
Zacarias
Moussaoui
, a man sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.
As for Obama's statement, federal prison officials confirmed that he is correct. No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal
supermax
facility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors.",1,Barack Obama
"""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open."" This week, Rand Paul is on a 10-stop tour of Iowa, seen by many as a trial run for a 2016 presidential campaign.
He’s been touting out his campaign positions, such as raising the retirement age and trying to play up his support for Israel . In a speech in Iowa City Tuesday, stumping for Republican House candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Paul spoke about what he sees as out-of-control government spending.
He also talked about the government shutdown last fall. Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but he said he thought shutting down the government was a ""bad idea."" And he carried the same position in Iowa this week.
""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,"" Paul said. ""You know your government’s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people.""
Coming from someone like Paul, who has been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter Chris Moody , who was there, tweeted it out.)
The economics
Paul’s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16.
During those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration --  were put on hold.
So how does not spending money come at a cost?
""Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'"" a spokesman told us. ""Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments.""
We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums.
But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity.
The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the Office of Management and Budget , which reports directly to the president. (Paul’s spokesman pointed us to this  New York Times  article about the White House report as evidence.)
Here’s a few highlights:
$2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending);
120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October;
$500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ;
$11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue;
Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown;
Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode;
1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn’t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities;
Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market.
We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy’s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013.)
Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown’s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned.
Standard and Poor's said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it Mostly True .)
Macroeconomic Advisers (in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, ""mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees.""
The Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay.
Bloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier.
The counterargument
In consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown.
Some libertarians argue -- such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes  -- that just because the government didn’t spend money for two weeks doesn’t mean that the same amount of money didn’t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening.
Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, made a similar argument , but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn’t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic ""bumps"" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown.",1,Rand Paul
"Sarah Palin ""already has more executive experience"" than Barack Obama and Joe Biden ""combined."" The experience issue came roaring back to the 2008 campaign after John McCain picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate.
The Sunday after the Palin announcement, Republican Rudy Giuliani defended the choice on CBS's
Face the Nation.
""Maybe it's my own background as a mayor and United States attorney,"" Giuliani said. ""But this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her. I mean, she already has more executive experience than Biden and Obama combined.""
Palin graduated from University of Idaho in 1987 with a major in journalism and worked as a sports reporter for about two years. She married her husband in 1988 and co-owned small businesses with him (a commercial fishing operation and a snow machine and all-terrain vehicle business).
In 1992, her political career began when she won election to the Wasilla (prounounced wah-SIL-uh) city council. In 1996, she ran for mayor of Wasilla and unseated the incumbent by a vote of 617 to 413, according to press reports.
Wasilla has a strong-mayor form of government. The mayor breaks ties on the city council and acts as the city administrator. When Palin took office in 1996, the pay was $68,000. In 2000, Wasilla had a population of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. It is located near the city of Anchorage.
During her tenure as mayor, Palin focused on increasing funding for basic infrastructure.
During her bid for re-election in 1999, the
Anchorage Daily News
reported that Palin ""counts among her successes the recently opened Fred Meyer store, the passage of a $5.5-million road and sewer bond, and the near halving of property taxes from 2 mills to 1.2 mills, the equivalent of an $80-a-year drop in taxes on a $100,000 home."" Palin also cut the budget of the city's museum, and all three of the museum's employees quit in protest.
Terms limits prevented her from running for mayor again in 2002. Instead, she ran for Alaska lieutenant governor and lost. In 2003, Gov. Frank Murkowski appointed her to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, where she served about a year before leaving the commission and blowing the whistle on fellow Republicans for conflicts of interest and conducting campaign work on public time.
In 2006, she ran for governor, defeating the incumbent Murkowski in a primary and then winning the general. She took office on Dec. 4, 2006, and will have held office for two years a month after Election Day.
So  Palin has six years of executive experience as mayor of Wasilla and two years of executive experience as governor of Alaska, for a total of eight years of executive experience.
Neither Obama, Biden, nor McCain have ever held the office of governor or mayor. McCain has about 13 months executive experience in leading a Navy unit of 1,000 people when he was in the military. So Palin beats all of them.
Obama has argued that running his national campaign constitutes relevant executive experience. ""My understanding is that Gov. Palin's town, Wasilla, has I think 50 employees,"" Obama told CNN on Sept. 1, 2008. ""We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think their budget is maybe 12-million dollars a year – we have a budget of about three times that just for the month.""
But we think elected executive experience is what Giuliani had in mind here. And even given Obama's point, Palin's years of elected executive experience beat out the rest of both tickets, even her own running mate.",1,Rudy Giuliani
"President Obama has ""stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' "" In his book Courage to Stand, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential GOP presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama ""needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism.""
And that needs to start with calling it by its real name, Pawlenty wrote.
""Sadly, President Obama will not call this effort what it is,"" Pawlenty wrote. ""He has stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' His administration never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently that isn't politically correct. The fact is, radical Islamic terrorism exists. Pointing that out doesn't condemn all Muslims. But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions. We need to call it what it is. We need to confront it, and we need to defeat it.""
This isn't the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase ""war on terror"" or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists.
Back in November 2009, we checked into a similar claim from Fox News' Sean Hannity that ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.' ""
Back then, we did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. Early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times.
And it's true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase ""war on terror"" in favor of more precise language.
Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews.
During a Jan. 27, 2009, interview with Obama, Hisham Melhem of Arabic-language television news station al-Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W. Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.""
Said Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.
""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.
""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.""
The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:
Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?""
Obama: ""Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.""
Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?""
Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.
Based on those facts, we rated Hannity's claim True. But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not ""admit we're at war,"" we rated Cheney's claim Pants in Fire .
Here, Pawlenty's claim is closer to Hannity's. So first we checked Obama's public statements since our previous fact-check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase ""war on terror"" or anything like ""radical Islamic terrorism."" And he has.
In May 2010, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, addressed the topic in some detail:
""The president’s strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face,"" Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Our enemy is not 'terrorism' because terrorism is but a tactic.  Our enemy is not 'terror' because terror is a state of mind, and as Americans we refuse to live in fear.  Nor do we describe our enemy as 'jihadists' or 'Islamists' because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenant of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children.
""Indeed, characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive. It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause, when in fact they are nothing more than murderers, including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims.""
""Moreover,"" Brennan said, ""describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie—propagated by al-Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism—that the United States is somehow at war against Islam. The reality, of course, is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam. After all, Islam, like so many faiths, is part of America.
""Instead, the president’s strategy is clear and precise. Our enemy is al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. For it was al-Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9/11 and whose desire to attack the United States, our allies, and our partners remains undiminished. And it is its affiliates who have taken up al-Qaida’s call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world.
""The president’s strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture. The United States of America is at war. We are at war against al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan, where al-Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan.""
More recently, in remarks at the Adams Center, a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques, on March 6, 2011, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser to the president, spoke about the strategy of the Obama administration's words.
""President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al-Qaida’s narrative and messaging, or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it,"" McDonough said. ""We’re determined to undermine it.""
In his book, Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase ""war on terror"" and his administration ""never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism."" We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about ""radical extremism"" or ""radical fundamentalism"" and the need to aggressively confront ""violent extremism and radical ideologies."" But he never attaches the words ""Islamic"" to those phrases. And neither has Obama. As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained, this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy, al-Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al-Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam. You may agree or disagree with Obama's word choices, or with Pawlenty's, but Pawlenty is correct about Obama's deliberate decision not to use the phrases ""war on terror"" or ""radical Islamic terrorism.",1,Tim Pawlenty
"""You've heard endlessly about waterboarding. It happened to three terrorists."" President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney squared off in dueling speeches on national security on May 21, 2009.
Not surprisingly, Cheney defended the controversial interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration on some terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks. And, he said, despite all the hand-wringing and public debate about waterboarding over the last couple years, the technique was used on only three detainees.
""You've heard endlessly about waterboarding,"" Cheney said in his address at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It happened to three terrorists. One of them was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, who has also boasted about his beheading of Daniel Pearl.
""We had a lot of blind spots after the attacks on our country, things we didn't know about al-Qaida. We didn't know about al-Qaida's plans, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and a few others did know.
""And with many thousands of innocent lives potentially in the balance, we did not think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all.""
Public records support his claim about the three detainees, who collectively were subjected to waterboarding at least 267 times.
The use of waterboarding — an interrogation technique that simulates drowning — was first publicly acknowledged by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during a Senate intelligence hearing on Feb. 5, 2008. He said it was used on three terror suspects in 2002 and 2003.
""Let me make it very clear and to state so officially in front of this committee that waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,"" Hayden said. ""It was used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It was used on Abu Zubaydah. And it was used on (Abd al-Rahim al-)Nashiri. The CIA has not used waterboarding for almost five years.""
According to a memo released by the Attorney General's Office in April 2009, waterboarding was removed from CIA’s authorized list of techniques sometime after 2005.
Also in April 2009, the Justice Department released 2005 legal memos that detailed the use of the waterboarding technique in 2002 and 2003, including the revelation that it had been used 183 times against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cheney is correct that during a military tribunal in 2007, Mohammed claimed responsibility for the murder of
Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002.
The memos also noted that the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, described by the CIA as one of Osama bin Laden's key lieutenants.
And lastly, the technique was used on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the 2000 USS
Cole
bombing.
In all three cases, Hayden said, ""We used it against these three high-value detainees because of the circumstances of the time. Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent.""
There has been no information publicly released that any other terror suspects have been subjected to waterboarding.
""We only know of those three being waterboarded,"" said Joanne Mariner, a counterterrorism expert with Human Rights Watch. ""That's all that's on the public record.""
In short, Cheney is on solid ground with this statistic.",1,Dick Cheney
"""I joined the Gang of 14, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, so that we wouldn't blow up the United States Senate.  Sen. Obama had the opportunity to join that group.  He chose not to."" In the contest to claim the title as the true champion of bipartisan politics, both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama often portray themselves as the man most likely to have success reaching across the aisle to break the logjam of Washington politics.
To bolster his case, McCain recently harkened back to the spring of 2005, when he was part of a small bipartisan effort to resolve a bitter standoff between Senate Democrats and Republicans over three conservative judicial nominees named by President George W. Bush.
""I joined the Gang of 14, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, so that we wouldn't blow up the United States Senate,"" McCain said in a virtual town hall meeting on June 14, 2008. ""Sen. Obama had the opportunity to join that group. He chose not to.""
At the time, the Democrats were using the filibuster to block confirmation votes on some conservative judges. Traditionally, the selection of judges had been viewed as a presidential power that was not to be curtailed. Senators felt free to vote against a nomination, but using procedural powers in the Senate to keep them from coming to a vote at all hadn't been done. The idea that Democrats were willing to use the filibuster to block judges was seen by many as an affront to the protocol-driven operations of the Senate.
The Republicans, headed by Bill Frist, were bucking for the so-called ""nuclear option,"" in which they would approve a series of procedural changes to allow the Senate to end filibusters with a majority vote, rather than a ""supermajority"" vote of 60 votes (essentially putting an end to the practice altogether).
As part of the Gang of 14 compromise, the Democrats agreed not to support furthering the filibuster of the judicial nominees and not to initiate filibusters of future nominations except under ""extreme circumstances."" In exchange, the Republicans agreed not to vote with Frist on the ""nuclear option."" To be sure, McCain caught a lot of political heat from hard-line members of his party who wanted to move ahead with the ""nuclear option.""
Obama was not one of the seven Democrats on the Gang of 14.
At the time, Obama reluctantly supported the filibuster.
""I'm not a huge fan of the filibuster,"" Obama was quoted as saying in April 2005. ""Historically, what was it used for? Keeping me (an African-American) out of polling places.""
Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of the Gang of 14, told McClatchy Newspapers in March 2008 that it was unfair to emphasize Obama's absence from the bipartisan group, because he wasn't pressed to join.
""When we got to seven (Democrats) counting myself, there was some discussion of expanding it,"" Nelson said, ""but there was the thought it would be more unworkable.""
In his book,
The Audacity of Hope,
Obama states:  ""I declined to be a part of what would be called the Gang of 14; given the profiles of some of the judges involved, it was hard to see what judicial nominee might be so much worse as to constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' worthy of filibuster. Still, I could not fault my colleagues for their efforts. The Democrats involved had made a practical decision — without the deal, the 'nuclear option' would have likely gone through.""
In an interview with the
St. Petersburg Times
on May 21, 2008, Obama was less generous in his assessment of the deal.
""The Republicans like to emphasize the Gang of 14 because frankly the Republicans got everything they wanted out of that,"" Obama said. ""I don't think it was a particularly good compromise.""
One can attach whatever significance one wants to McCain's statement, but the bottom line is that it's accurate.",1,John McCain
"""From 2003 to 2006, 'Sesame Street' made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales."" Is Big Bird a fat cat? Is Elmo a lobbyist?
So says Sen. Jim DeMint, who is leading the charge to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. DeMint's Muppet rant was set off, in part, by a press conference on Feb. 16, in which Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., stood alongside a life-size version of Arthur from the animated PBS show of the same name, and blasted the Republican plan to eliminate CPB funding.
Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said Republicans ought to be focused more on reviving the economy and less on ""silencing Cookie Monster"" and ""laying off Bert and Ernie.""
DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a blog post and an op-ed in the Washington Times in which he argued that Sesame Street would do just fine without federal funding.
""Shows like Sesame Street are thriving, multimillion-dollar enterprises,"" DeMint wrote. ""According to the 990 tax form all nonprofits are required to file, Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 -- nearly a million dollars -- in compensation in 2008. And, from 2003 to 2006, Sesame Street made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales. Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies.""
That's a lot of Elmo dolls. So we decided to check DeMint's numbers, and to put his overall argument about Sesame Street solvency into some context.
We got the 2009 990 tax form submitted by the Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit group that produces the show, and DeMint is correct. It shows Knell's salary at $806,990, with an additional $149,523 worth of other compensation. For the toy sales numbers, we have to go to the 2008 990 tax form. In a section on ""other income,"" it reports ""toys and consumer products"" as bringing just over $211 million from 2003 through 2006 (nearly $53 million a year, on average).
Now for some of the bigger picture.
The 2009 tax form shows that Sesame Workshop brought in about $140 million in revenues in 2008, with government grants accounting for just over $14 million of that (roughly 10 percent).
So would Sesame Street be ""just fine"" without that government money, as DeMint says, or would it ""silence Cookie Monster,"" as Lowey said.
They are probably both exaggerating.
Sesame Street is a lucrative enterprise, and Big Bird isn't likely to jump ship to Nickelodeon if federal funds are eliminated. But some of the services Sesame Street provides might, according to a statement released by Knell, the Sesame president.
""As a nonprofit organization which has a long history of building public and private partnerships, Sesame Workshop has benefited from the generous support of CPB [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting], which most recently provided critical grant support for literacy programs for 6-9 year olds, like The Electric Company,"" Knell said in a statement released Feb. 15, 2011. ""CPB has helped support our work with military families to provide social and emotional coping skills for children of parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have left family behind during deployment. It also has provided important funding for our work helping parents who have lost jobs or been displaced due to the economic recession to keep their families intact and positively motivated. Additionally, CPB has been active in helping transition video content into digital assets to be used in schools and distributed through web-based applications nationwide.""
With federal funding an annual and often highly political battle, Sesame Workshop and many other companies that get support from the CPB have tried to become increasingly less reliant on government support.
According to a fact-sheet provided by Sesame Workshop, revenues from sales of its products ""offset about two-thirds of the research and production costs associated with the Workshop’s educational programs. The remaining one third comes from a combination of philanthropic support, corporate sponsorship and government funding.""
""As a result of this financial revenue model,"" the fact-sheet says, ""we are able to deliver each new season of Sesame Street to PBS with more than 93 percent of production costs covered by licensing activities or corporate sponsorships. In 2010, Sesame Workshop had total operating revenues of $136.4 million and total operating expenses of $136.5 million.""
Under different circumstances, Republicans might be cheering Sesame Street for making money ""the good old-fashioned way"" through merchandise sales instead of relying as heavily on federal handouts, said Steve Behrens, editor of Current, a newspaper and website about public media in the United States. Now, he said, that success is being used against it. It's so successful, the argument goes, it doesn't need the government's help.
Sesame Street might be okay without federal funds, Behrens said, but other kids programs that are ""less successful selling dolls"" might not be. (Indeed, we're thinking that sales of Jim Lehrer plush toys may not cover the full cost of the NewsHour.)
Particularly hard hit by elimination of CPB funds would be some of the independent programming that gives public broadcasting its identity, Behrens said.
""The independent productions are almost all paid by federal money or foundations,"" Behrens said. ""Foundations only pay for things they have a direct interest in. They want programs that reflect their interests and promoting their ideas...There are strings attached to every piece of money that comes in to public broadcasting. Except for the federal piece.""
""Certain things would disappear,"" Behrens said, ""and the whole idea that it belongs to the public, there would be less reason to think that. It would be nice if some of the money coming in to public broadcasting didn't have so many strings attached to it.""
In an op-ed piece, Jonathan C. Abbott, president and CEO of WGBH, and Charles Kravetz, general manager of WBUR, argue the elimination of CPB funds would hit smaller, rural stations the hardest.
""Each federal dollar provides critical seed money that public broadcasters leverage to raise more than six more dollars from local sources,"" they wrote. ""As crucial as CPB funding is to stations in major metropolitan areas like ours, the situation is even more dire for smaller stations, where federal funding truly is the life blood.""
Charles Chamberlain, political director for liberal group Democracy for America, said the point of public broadcasting ""is that the programs offered should not/must not be subject to the whims of corporate sponsors and the ups and downs of merchandise sales. The shows and programs on public TV are subject to the needs of the entire public. The public funds these important programs as an alternative to the privately funded model used for programing on network and cable TV because profit shouldn't be the driving force behind every single form of broadcast media, especially educational programing.
""So the point here is not if Sesame Street can survive without publicly funding. The point is Sesame Street must stay independent of corporate sponsors or merchandise sales to retain its public educational mission and meet the full needs of the entire public,"" Chamberlain said.
Again, we're fact-checking Sen. DeMint's statement that Sesame Street raked in tens of millions of dollars from toy and consumer product sales over a recent four-year period, a figure cited as backing for his larger argument that ""Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies.""
Federal grants make up less than 10 percent of Sesame Street's budget. Whether Sesame Street would be ""just fine"" without that money is largely in the eye of the beholder. It seems unlikely that cutting federal funds would spell the end of Sesame Street, though some argue it might cause the demise of some small, rural stations that carry Sesame Street.
Still, as its own tax filings show, Sesame Street makes a lot of its revenue from non-government sources, much of it through the sale of toys and other consumer products. Toy revenue is just a portion of Sesame Street's budget and federal funding for Sesame Street is just a portion of the overall issue of federal funding for public broadcasting. But DeMint's figures on Sesame Street toy revenues are right.",1,Jim DeMint
"""Could I just point out that ... I seem to get the first question all the time?"" Suggesting that she's being treated more harshly by the press than her opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton noted toward the start of a debate with Sen. Barack Obama that she often has to answer the first question in televised debates. The comment was surprising in tone and content, coming abruptly after a long back-and-forth on health care and in answer to a question about who's right on NAFTA.
""Well, could I just point out that, in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time? And I don't mind,"" Clinton said during a Feb. 26, 2008, Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio. ""You know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious. And if anybody saw
Saturday Night Live
, you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow.""
A few boos could be heard before the debate continued.
Clinton is right. She has received the first question in five of the six debates this year. Here's a look at the opening question for each of those debates:
• Jan. 5 in Manchester, N.H.: Moderator Charles Gibson of ABC News asks Sen. Barack Obama if he stands by a foreign policy speech in which he said he ""would go into western Pakistan if (he) had actionable intelligence to go after (Osama bin Laden) whether or not the Pakistani government agreed.""
• Jan. 15 in Las Vegas: Moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asks Clinton how, on Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, race became such a prominent issue in the campaign. ""How did we get here?"" he asks.
• Jan. 21 in Myrtle Beach, S.C.: CNN correspondent Joe Johns asks Clinton: ""How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?""
• Jan. 31 in Los Angeles (first one-on-one debate): Doyle McManus, Washington bureau chief for the
Los Angeles Times,
asks Clinton what she thinks is the ""most important policy distinction between"" her and Obama.
• Feb. 21 in Austin, Texas: Univision anchor Jorge Ramos starts things off in Spanish: ""The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?""
• Feb. 26 in Cleveland: NBC's Williams questions Clinton about the change in tone between the Feb. 21 debate and rhetoric on the campaign trail: ""You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking,"" he says.
Still, it's funny that Clinton would complain about getting the first question all the time because it wasn't too long ago that there were so many Democratic contenders that many were complaining about not getting enough questions. Besides, in a debate format, isn't it a good thing to go first?
""In terms of receiving the first question, I have not seen people make a big deal about that,"" said Gordon R. Mitchell, University of Pittsburgh professor and director of the William Pitt Debating Union, one of the nation's oldest debate organizations. ""There are issues about who gets to speak first in terms of opening speeches and closing speeches ... but in this format, where there were a series of questions ... if there was an advantage or disadvantage to receiving the first question, it quickly was counteracted by the many follow-up questions that evened things out.""
Mitchell thinks Clinton got her message wrong.
""My impression of what was happening here is Hillary was actually trying to say, 'Hey, I always get all of the hard questions,' and it just came out as, 'Hey, how come I'm always getting the first question?' "" he said.
Perhaps that's what she meant, but we can only evaluate what she said.",1,Hillary Clinton
"""More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance."" In light of protests in Chicago that led to the cancellation of Donald Trump’s rally in the city, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that Trump should take a cue from Cruz himself.
Cruz chided protesters for ""behaving abusively"" and Trump for telling his supporters to punch protesters in the face on NBC’s Meet the Press.
""I think it is important that any political candidate demonstrate respect for the voters. You know, listen, I get protesters at my events. But it's very different,"" Cruz said March 13. ""When I have protesters at my events, I endeavor to engage in them with civility and respect. More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance.""
HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER
Is it true that Ted Cruz, famed for his debating prowess, actually engages protesters?
When we asked the Cruz campaign for examples, they pointed us to a recent event at the University of Maine and Cruz’s interaction with actress Ellen Page at the Iowa State Fair. In fact, ""more than once"" is an understatement, Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips argued.
""Admittedly, the press rarely writes about it, because it is common and generally a respectful exchange,"" Phillips said. ""It happens all the time.""
Campaign reporters we spoke with agreed with Cruz’s statement, and we came across several examples of Cruz interacting politely with people with dissenting views or at least addressing their policy concerns.
Let’s discuss
Cruz made headlines in July 2015 when he debated anti-war activists for 24 minutes at the Stop the Iran Deal Rally in Washington.
""We want diplomacy, not war,"" a Code Pink protester yelled a few seconds into Cruz’s speech.
""You know it’s very interesting thing to see those who profess to believe in free speech who are afraid of speech,"" he said, before inviting the protester and his colleagues to come forward and discuss their opposing views.
A month later, Cruz famously sparred with Ellen Page over the intersection of religious freedom and gay rights. Cruz disagreed with Page on most (if not all) points, but kept the exchange going for about six minutes.
Even beyond flashy rallies and famous actresses, Cruz does genuinely engage voters, not necessarily protesters, who disagree with him, reporters covering the Cruz campaign told us.
For example, Politico reported on Cruz discussing Obamacare with a voter in Hubbard, Iowa, on Jan. 30. The voter pressed Cruz on his vow to repeal the health care law, and told Cruz that his brother-in-law finally gained health insurance under Obamacare but died because tumors were discovered too late.
""What are you going to replace (Obamacare) with?"" the voter asked.
""Well, sir, I’m sorry for your family’s loss, I’m sorry for your wife’s loss,"" Cruz said and launched into a critique of Obamacare.
""My question is, what are you going to replace it what?"" the voter continued to ask.
Cruz responded that he would allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines and expand health savings accounts.
A day later, an angry farmer in Iowa grilled Cruz on his position against the ethanol mandate (as many cameras and microphones lurked). Here’s a snippet of their exchange:
Voter:  ""Why are trying to put salt on our injuries and wanting to take away our subsidies for biofuels?""
Cruz: ""Well sir, I’m not.""
Voter: ""Yes, you are, you made that statement. Don’t tell me you’re not. You’re gonna keep it for the big oil people in Texas.""
Cruz: ""Sir, I’m happy to have a conversation with you but not to yell.""
Voter: ""I’ll quit yelling.""
Cruz: ""Okay, I’m happy to have a conversation, but I’ll treat you respectfully.""
Voter: ""I don’t understand it (Cruz’s ethanol position).""
Cruz: ""Okay, I’m happy to answer.""
Cruz then explained his policy views to the voter for six minutes and answered additional questions.
One-sided discussions
When it comes to actual protesters, Cruz’s engagement is sometimes a bit one-sided and is geared toward riling up his supporters, said Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune.
""(Cruz) doesn’t create a real dialogue. It’s more for show than anything,"" he said. ""He doesn’t exactly talk with the protesters, but he does provide some kind of rebuttal. He is different from a lot of candidates in that he at least addresses what they’re trying to bring up.""
Take, for example, how he handled protesters at the University of Maine on March 4. Cruz didn’t debate them, but did use their appearance to double down on his immigration policy.
""You wrote a sign that says, ‘There’s no human being that’s illegal.’ Now that’s true. Every human being is God’s creation, a precious gift from God. But if you really believe that no human being can break the law, you will discover the falsity of that if you resist the police officer right now.""
When protesters interrupted him later, Cruz quipped, ""They hear there’s a Mexican border and they start chanting ‘Bernie’? ‘Build bridges, not walls’ — you know that is a very interesting statement. But I’m curious, what do you say to all those people who lose their jobs, what do you say to all those people whose wages are going down, what do you say to single moms who can’t afford to provide for their families? Sir, sir, I appreciate you exercising your First Amendment right, but the First Amendment does not give you the right to silence others.""
Cruz reacted similarly, reaffirming his opposition to eminent domain when protesters chanted ""hands off our public lands"" at a February rally in Las Vegas.
""Thank you very much, sir, for expressing your views. One of the great things about the First Amendment is that it even allows Bernie Sanders supporters to come to our events,"" Cruz joked . ""And let me say sir, you have a First Amendment right to express your views, but at the same time, 85 percent of the state of Nevada is owned by the federal government. That will end when I become president of the United States.""
Heckling hecklers
Of course, Cruz’s reaction isn’t to talk issues every time he’s interrupted. Often, he brushes it off with jokes.
When a heckler yelled , ""Ted Cruz looks so weird"" at a Jan. 31 Cruz rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz responded with wisecracks: ""Apparently, the bars let out early tonight"" and ""Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back?""
A few weeks earlier, a man interrupted Cruz’s Jan. 12 Second Amendment rally in Hudson, N.H.
""Why is everyone so excited about guns? They kill people,"" the heckler said.
""Sir, you are welcome to be a part of the crowd, but you are not a part of this group. I understand that you’re very confused,"" Cruz responded, chuckling, as the man was escorted off stage.
As Cruz began to transition into a stump speech about freedom, a second protester got up on stage, prompting Cruz to take a harsher tone: ""Oh, we’ve got another young man who’s very confused. Son, thank you — hey, hey, this is not your stage. … Boy, it’s almost like the Bernie Sanders people are scared. The Bernistas are out in force!""
A month later, two men  — who appear to be the same guys at the gun rally and identified as a ""guerilla comedy"" duo by the Huffington Post — tried to perform an exorcism on Cruz in Raymond, N.H., on Feb. 8.
""Ted Cruz, look in the mirror and let the evil spirit leave, leave your power-hungry, demonic soul,"" one called out .
""They’re very nice young men, a very confused fellow. Apparently, they’re Bernie Sanders campaign,"" Cruz laughed.
""Look at yourself in the mirror,"" the heckler yelled back.
""You know, the very odd things, usually lefties don’t believe in God,"" he said as the two were escorted out of the event.
Cruz cracked a Bernie Sanders joke when protesters interrupted his rally in Houston, Texas.
""I understand you seem confused about the First Amendment,"" he said , addressing the protesters. ""You have a right to speak, but you don’t have the right to disrupt others. I’m curious, does that coordinated effort suggest the lefties are getting scared?""",1,Ted Cruz
"""In the first round of repayments""  from financial institutions that received TARP money, ""the government has actually turned a profit."" Admit it: When the federal government decided last fall to spend hundreds of billions to stabilize banks through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, you thought the money was as good as gone.
Not so, President Barack Obama said at the White House on June 9, 2009.
""Several financial institutions are set to pay back $68 billion to taxpayers,"" he said. ""And while we know that we will not escape the worst financial crisis in decades without some losses to taxpayers, it's worth noting that in the first round of repayments from these companies the government has actually turned a profit.""
A quick summary of how we got to this point:
As part of the TARP, the government invested about $200 billion in 600 banks across the country, essentially buying up preferred stock.
A lot of banks now want out. The government money came with strings, including restrictions on executive compensation. Plus, there was a stigma attached to participating in the government program.
On June 9, the Treasury Department announced that 10 of the largest financial institutions that participated in the Capital Purchase Program (through TARP) have been approved to repay $68 billion. Yes, they had to be approved to repay the money. The companies had to prove they no longer needed the money, because the government doesn't want them begging for more down the road.
To date, those 10 companies have paid dividends on their preferred stock to the Treasury totaling about $1.8 billion, the Treasury announced. Overall, dividend payments from all of the 600 bank participants has come to about $4.5 billion so far. That's commensurate with the 5 percent (annualized) dividend return that was part of the terms of the program.
Now, the government borrowed the money it invested in the banks, and so dividends from the preferred stock are offset by interest the government has had to pay on its loans. But that interest rate has been lower than the 5 percent dividend rate. So when the companies repay the loans, it will result in some profit to the government, banking analysts told us.
There's another potential profit center. As part of the deal with banks, the federal government received warrants to buy stock at a future date (with the hope that as the economy improved and bank stock value rose, the government could share in the bounty). According to the Treasury announcement on June 9, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase those warrants at fair market value. Experts believe that could fetch the government several billion dollars. That's in addition to the dividends.
David John, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while it's accurate to say the government is turning a profit on these specific transactions, it was so costly to create the TARP that ""you can't say the overall program is a moneymaker.""
And, John said, the 10 financial institutions that will be repaying the Treasury are among the strongest. It remains to be seen how the others will fare, he said.
""It's way too soon to judge the entire program,"" John said. ""I'd be surprised if it ends up anything better than break-even.""
Still, the public too often tagged TARP as a bailout, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.
""It's as if people thought money was handed out to banks,"" Hall said. ""It wasn't. And it drove us nuts. The government has turned a profit. It made money plus some.""
Bank analyst Bert Ely said while the government may end up losing money on investments in some financial firms, it's likely the entirety of the bank portion of the TARP will ultimately turn a profit.
The 5 percent paid in dividends on preferred stock purchased by the Treasury will certainly outpace the interest rate on money borrowed to finance the program, he said. And the warrants could also prove profitable.
""People think the government gave banks money,"" Ely said. ""They made investments in banks.""
As for Obama's claim, he is careful to note that the overall program could still cost taxpayers money, but he is correct to say the government turned a profit on the first round of repayments.",1,Barack Obama
"""The U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident."" In making his pitch for more nuclear power plants as one way to address global warming, Sen. John McCain is fond of citing a military statistic.
""My friends, the U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident,"" McCain said in Nashville, Tenn., on June 2, 2008. ""That's because we have well-trained and capable people.""
Indeed, the U.S. Navy turned to nuclear power in the 1950s to make its submarines faster and able to stay submerged longer. They are also quieter, more stealth. Since commissioning the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus , in 1954, the Navy has steamed 139-million miles around the world on various nuclear-powered vessels. Currently, there are 102 nuclear reactors aboard 80 Navy combat vessels, mainly submarines and aircraft carriers.
""We have never had an accident or release of radioactivity which has had an adverse effect on human health or the environment,"" said Lukas McMichael, a public affairs officer for Naval Reactors, the U.S. government office that oversees the operation of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. ""His (McCain's) statement is correct.""
Now, two nuclear subs still sit on the Atlantic floor, having sunk in the 1960s.
The first to go down was the USS Thresher in April 1963 during deep-diving tests 200 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. All 129 officers, crewmen and military and civilian technicians aboard were killed.
The USS Scorpion submarine went down about 400 miles southwest of the Azores in May 1968. All 99 crewmen aboard died.
While there is some disagreement about the cause of the accidents, neither went down as a result of problems with the nuclear reactors.
The Navy has done some environmental monitoring over the years of the ocean floor around where the subs sank, and has determined there has been no significant impact to the environment. The low levels of radioactivity close to the submarines, McMichael said, were no different than the background levels of radioactivity found anywhere on the ocean floor.
While environmental and nuclear watchdog groups agree with McCain's statement about the Navy's accident-free record, many take issue with its significance as it relates to expanding the number of commercial nuclear power plants in the United States.
""The Navy, they train their people well,"" said Kurt Zwally, National Wildlife Federation global warming solutions manager. ""The Navy's safety record is admirable. But there is a different safety record with plants in the U.S.""
Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., said commercial nuclear power plants have at times been run haphazardly and sloppily.
The Navy is one thing, Lyman said. ""Are they going to be able to run the commercial sector with that kind of discipline? I doubt it.""
The Navy's good safety culture is certainly one reason for its success, said Thomas B. Cochran, senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But there are other reasons. The Navy's reactors are much smaller and more robust than reactors used commercially. They are designed for combat and to take jolts from being in a submarine. So the comparison isn't entirely fair, he said.
In short, while there is debate about the relevance of McCain's statistic, McCain is right when he says there have been no reactor accidents aboard the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered vessels.",1,John McCain
"In the past three years, ""we've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some."" President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his ""all of the above"" energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden.
Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production, in the April 17, 2012, speech Obama said the opposite is true.
""There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more, then gas prices would come down right away. What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We’ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some,"" Obama said, with a nod to middle-school science class.
We've been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter. Here, we decided to check something we haven't heard before -- that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office.
First, it's important to note that it's unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction, which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment, an expert told us.
Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction. He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries.
For this item, we’re not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have. But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added.
To back up Obama's claim, the White House pointed us to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration , which regulates pipelines.
The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010. So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year.
Here's a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008 (right before Obama took office) and the end of 2010:
Crude oil
2008: 50,963 miles
2010: 54,728
+3,765
Petroleum products
2008: 61,599
2010: 64,752
+ 3,153
Natural gas transmission
2008: 303,182
2010: 304,691
+ 1,509
Natural gas distribution
2008: 2,074,513
2010: 2,095,690
+ 21,177
That adds up to 2,490,257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008, and 2,519,861 in 2010.
So that's 29,604 additional miles of pipeline. According to NASA , the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24,873.6 miles. Obama's comparison is accurate, and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010, the real, current figure is likely higher.
We asked two experts if the year-to-year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered.
Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton, said the data are reliable and ""as near as I can tell, the assertion is well documented and correct.""
Tadeusz Patzek, chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are ""field/project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput"" -- not large transmission lines many of us think of.
He's right. According to the DOT numbers, 21,177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines.
Still, such lines are ""a necessary piece"" of the whole system. Said Patzek: ""Without the small stuff you’re not going to increase the flow rate through the large.""
Is 29,604 miles over three years a lot?
For some perspective, we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W. Bush's presidency. They tell a wholly different story: 63,243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines -- more than Obama's overall total. But crude oil? Just 756 miles. Petroleum products: 808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007. We're not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard. The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand, and the industry's response to it, results from decisions made far from the White House.",1,Barack Obama
"""Grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists"" from Bermuda gave McCain $50,000. An attack ad from Barack Obama looks at a trip John McCain made to Bermuda last year.
""Bermuda. It’s more than just a vacation destination for John McCain,"" the ad says over jaunty, Caribbean-style steel drum music. ""McCain went to Bermuda, and while he was there pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore. And grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists who benefit from the tax scheme gave McCain $50,000.""
We looked in detail at McCain's visit in this statement . Here we'll look at the campaign contributions angle.
Bermuda, a British territory with significant autonomy, is home to many international companies seeking to avoid taxes. In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven.
To come up with its $50,000 number, the Obama campaign compiled a list of 30 people and one political action committee connected to insurance and reinsurance companies based in Bermuda. We obtained a copy of the list from the campaign and cross-checked with Federal Election Commission records and found it to be accurate.
It seems likely that the Obama campaign's numbers undercounted contributions from lobbyists connected to Bermuda-based insurance companies. We were able to independently document another $8,150 in contributions to McCain.
And finally, among the Bermuda-connected contributors, we found four donors also gave a combined total of $8,200 to Obama.
The timeline seems to be that McCain visited Bermuda in August 2007, a fundraiser for him was held in October (which he did not attend) and contributions were reported to the Federal Election Commission in November 2007 and afterward.
The ad stops short of saying there was a quid pro quo at work, though we get the feeling the Obama campaign wouldn't mind if you assumed there was. A story in the
Royal Gazette's
sister newspaper
Mid Ocean News
noted that McCain's 2007 comments were at odds with comments he made in 2002 deploring companies moving overseas. McCain said then, ""More and more U.S. companies are using this highly profitable accounting scheme that allows a company to move its legal residence to offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax, and shield its profits from taxes. I applaud efforts to discourage this practice.""
The McCain campaign responded to the Obama ad by pointing out that the Obama campaign rents office space from Accenture, which is based in Bermuda. The
Chicago Sun-Times
reported in 2007 that the Obama campaign was leasing the 11th floor of an office tower for its headquarters from Accenture. The company is based in Bermuda.
The ad states that McCain got $50,000 from people connected to Bermuda-based companies, and we find this accurately portrays the contributions received.",1,Barack Obama
"McCain ""hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign."" In an attempt to wrest the moral high ground on special interest influence, Sen. Barack Obama has gone on the offensive, accusing Republican Sen. John McCain of talking tough on campaign finance reform, but then stocking his campaign with lobbyists.
At a rally in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Obama said that despite 10 years ago proposing a bill that would have banned lobbyists from being paid by a campaign, McCain ""hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign.""
The McCain campaign's ties to current or former lobbyists has been well documented in recent weeks. Disclosures about some of those ties — including clients they have served — led to a handful of departures from the campaign. The highest profile casualty was former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, campaign co-chairman and national finance committee co-chairman. Loeffler is a lobbyist and founder of the Loeffler Group, a multimillion-dollar lobbying operation that, according to
Houston Chronicle
reports last year, has included clients such as AT&T, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Port of Houston, Southwest Airlines and Toyota Motor Co. The firm also has represented the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on trade issues.
In response, the McCain campaign on May 15, 2008, instituted a ""conflict policy"" — the campaign will not keep any federal lobbyists on its payroll. Period.
""We are in compliance with that policy,"" McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told PolitiFact.
But the campaign is still thick with former lobbyists, some who left or took unpaid leave of absences from their lobbying firms just before joining the campaign.
One of them is Charlie Black, a senior adviser on the McCain campaign. Described by the
Washington Post
as a ""longtime uber lobbyist,"" Black retired as chairman of BKSH & Associates in March. He told the
New York Times
he is not paid by the campaign.
Then there's campaign manager Rick Davis, who hasn't been a registered lobbyist for five years and took a leave of absence from his lobbying firm Davis Manafort two years ago.
Black defended the use of former lobbyists.
""I think you can change professions and unless you did something unethical or criminal, your past profession should not be injected into the candidate's campaign,"" Black told the
New York Times.
""It's absurd.""
Said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign: ""John McCain has an unmatched record of fighting the influence of special interests in Washington. The McCain campaign has implemented the strictest policy against lobbyists in presidential campaign history, and we challenge Sen. Obama to meet our standard.""
Okay, so McCain has clearly set a policy that forbids current federal lobbyists from drawing a campaign paycheck and campaign officials say they are in full compliance with that. Now. But the policy comes more than a year into the campaign. Current lobbyists hired by the campaign may have now been purged, but the fact is they were hired.

"Financial conflict-of-interest ""laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust."" How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question.
Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust , which is when an independent trustee manages another person’s assets without the person’s input.
But Trump doesn’t actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws don’t apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trump’s cabinet.
""Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right?"" Giuliani told CNN’s Jake Tapper Nov. 13 . ""So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.""
Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests.
The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees can’t participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest.
Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest.
But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the law’s definitions , Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges.
""It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws,"" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.
Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too.
It’s been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989.
In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples.
""As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions,"" said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School.
While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that don’t exempt the president.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released.
Then there’s the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012 , for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul.
""If any of Trump’s business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities,"" Clark said.
But it's not fully clear that presidents are bound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question.
The way the clause is constructred —  that it doesn't specify the president, unlike other provisions in the Constitution, for example — and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents, said Seth Barrett Tillman , a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause.",1,Rudy Giuliani
"During a town hall meeting on health care, ""ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired."" Rep. Lamar Smith was outraged that ABC News was dedicating a day of coverage to health care reform, capping it off with an exclusive town hall with President Barack Obama.
""It was like a rigged football game,"" Smith told Greta Van Susteren during an interview on Fox News. ""The president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.""
Smith, a Republican from Texas, made his comments even before the special aired on June 24, 2009. We wanted to know if it was true that ABC ""didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired.""
A call to ABC confirmed that this was true. Though ABC accepts advertising for political candidates, it has a policy of rejecting ads that advocate for general political issues, a spokeswoman told us. We tried to ask more detailed questions about the policy, but she wouldn't talk about specifics.
We were able to find several news reports about ABC rejecting other ads over the years, including ads that opposed the oil industry and the Iraq war.
Adding another wrinkle, local ABC affiliates set their own standards to sell ads. Naturally, viewers at home have no way of knowing if the ad was sold by the local affiliate or the parent network.
Smith complained after the advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights tried and failed to buy ads during the president's town hall. The group is opposed to Democratic plans for  the health care system because they say it would create a socialized medical system similar to Canada's or Britain's. (We examined one of their ads back in April and rated a claim about health effectiveness research as Barely True .)
Conservatives for Patients' Rights disputed ABC's claim that it did not accept advocacy ads. In a letter to ABC, the group cited a report from TNS Media Intelligence, a respected independent media firm, that showed ad buys by T. Boone Pickens, who argues for energy independence, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which promotes fiscal responsibility.
We asked Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the major network news programs at his Web site the Tyndall Report, about advocacy ads appearing on the networks. He said it's true that ABC and the other major networks forbid issue advocacy ads, but there is a gray area: The networks will accept public-interest ads from lobbying groups that are generally positive in tone and message. These types of ads usually air during the Sunday morning shows, he said.
""You can't address matters of public controversy in those. You can only burnish your image,"" Tyndall said.
In theory, if Conservatives for Patients' Rights had designed an ad that talked about how wonderful the private insurance system is, that might have passed muster with ABC. ""You can say the good part, but not the bad part,"" Tyndall concluded.
The network's rules are internal standards that are holdovers from the days when broadcast networks were more closely regulated, Tyndall said.
In fact, advocacy ads usually air on local affiliates and cable channels, and there are several reasons for this, said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group that is part of TNS Media Intelligence.
On cable news channels, advertisers feel like they're reaching a demographic that includes news junkies and policymakers. When Congress is in session, advocacy groups will buy time with affiliates in Washington, D.C. That advertising follows members of Congress home to local affiliates during the breaks, especially if the member is a swing vote or chairs a committee with jurisdiction over a particular issue.
The handful of national networks, though, just want to avoid controversy.
""By and large, historically, they've stayed away from this stuff as much as possible, though no one is 100 percent pure,"" Tracey said. ""There's probably stuff they've taken in the past where the salespeople said, 'This isn't very controversial,' and so they took it.""
In this case, things may have worked out well for both sides, Tracey said. ""ABC is probably happy they didn't take the spot, and Conservatives for Patients' Rights is just as happy because they didn't have to pay for it, and they still get their publicity.""
The congressman is right, though. He said, ""ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired."" Groups who opposed Obama's plan tried to buy advertising during his town hall meeting and were turned down. Even ABC said that was the case.",1,Lamar Smith
"""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children."" In a Father's Day address at the Apostolic Church of God in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama chose a less than celebratory topic: the absence of men in the lives of many children, especially black children.
""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children.""
He went on to say that these absent fathers don't realize that ""responsibility does not end at conception"" and are ""acting like boys instead of men.""
The
New York Times
noted that Obama sounded like comedian Bill Cosby, who has blamed fatherlessness in the black community, among other things, for African-Americans' overrepresentation in jail and underrepresentation among the educated.
By using the term ""we,"" we will assume Obama is speaking to people roughly his age, 46. And by that measure, his claim is backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1960, the year before Obama was born, 22 percent of black children lived with single parents. In 1968, the number rose to 31.4 percent. By 2006, the 1960 percentage had more than doubled to 56 percent.
And the single parents are overwhelmingly women.
In 2006, 91.4 percent of single parents of black children were mothers. That figure hasn't changed over the years. In 1960, it was a shade lower at 91 percent.
The figures for single-parent families show a rosier picture among other races. About 28 percent of children of all races lived with a single parent in 2006. In 1960, only about 9 percent of American children lived with a single parent.
The absence of fathers is important, Obama continued, because ""children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.""
Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist with Harvard Medical School and co-author with Bill Cosby of
Come on People: On the Path from Victims to Victors,
said Obama's view rings true: The absence of fathers corresponds with a host of social ills, including dropping out of school and serving time in jail.
But he said other factors such as poverty, education level and the age of parents also correlate with single motherhood and adolescent problems.
""I felt he was correct in calling attention to the fact that father involvement in children's lives is very important for their well-being and their healthy growth, and studies show that,"" Poussaint said.
Rebecca Blank, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies social and economic policy, wrote in an e-mail that it's difficult to pinpoint the exact causes of the social problems Obama mentions because they're so interrelated.
But solid research has shown that growing up in a single-family household, even if other factors are controlled, has a negative effect.
""I think there are very few social scientists these days who wouldn't agree that children in single-parent households are at risk of a variety of bad outcomes and that family structure has some causal impact on that risk,"" she wrote.
Obama's premise that the absence of fathers is leading to social problems is backed up by research, but we're not ruling on that part of his statement. We're ruling on his claim that, ""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children,"" which U.S. Census numbers substantiate. And we rule it to be True.",1,Barack Obama
"Says Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to defense budget that the military hasn’t asked for. Republican nominee Mitt Romney has said he plans to increase defense spending by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years if he’s elected president. In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, ""Where are you going to get the money?""
Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states.
President Barack Obama said Romney’s plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn’t necessary. Romney ""wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,"" Obama said.
In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don’t want.
Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military ""will not be a cost-free process,"" and said he will ""begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.""
What’s 4 percent worth?
The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security , a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN .
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate.
In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve.
While the campaign website describes the goal as ""a floor"", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it ""a target"" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse ""Obama-era defense cuts.""
In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’
This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that.
What the Pentagon is asking for
In the debate, Romney said, ""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285.""
In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy , Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus’s remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach.
""A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,"" he said.
The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military.
""We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020,"" Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. ""We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere.""
Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face.
""The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,"" Panetta told the budget committee . ""We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.""
Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, ""the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.""
The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public.
This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan.
""It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,"" Bensahel said.
Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.",1,Barack Obama
"As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon ""was caught tipping off a ringside physician"" about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers. U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut.
While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers.
In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers.
""Read this,"" a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. ""It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator.""
The memo in question -- marked ""CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO"" -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s.
But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers.
As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that ""the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids.""
""In addition,"" McMahon wrote, ""this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF.""
Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him.
""Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea,"" McMahon wrote in the memo. ""Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.""
It's that last part, telling Patterson to ""clue him in"" about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad.
In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison.
But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to ""unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon.""
In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2.
According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, ""a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel."" It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors.
""Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything,"" McDevitt said. ""It was all given to the government.""
In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed.
And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck.
In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's  The Day , reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo.
""I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case,"" McMahon told The Day. ""It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve.""
According to the story:
When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt.
""I can't speak to any of that,' she said. ""I have no idea.""
WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation.
""There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind,"" McDevitt said. ""There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody.""
An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything.
""You can only gain an acquittal in this country,"" McDevitt said. ""That's all you can do.""
Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo ""to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.""
It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to ""hide"" evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers.",1,Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
"A bipartisan background check amendment ""outlawed any (gun) registry.  Plain and simple, right there in the text."" President Barack Obama accused the ""gun lobby and its allies"" of lying about a bipartisan background check proposal that failed Wednesday in the Senate.
From the Rose Garden, he charged :
""They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter.""
The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 .
Did it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry?
‘A path to a national gun registry’
The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers — but not for sales between folks who aren’t in the business of selling guns.
Manchin and Toomey’s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn’t go as far as the original bill , which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions .
That compromise wasn’t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment. It failed on a 54 to 46 vote.
Opponents had, indeed, raised the specter of a national gun registry.
""If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey-Schumer-Manchin (and virtually all will be) ... you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry,"" wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America .
The existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473 . That personal information is then run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information, but gun dealers are required to store the forms.
The government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records they’re supposed to keep.
So what did the Manchin-Toomey amendment say about a registry?
First, it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry.
Since the mid 1980s, it’s been against federal law for information from background checks to be ""recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established.""
That’s why, if you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day.
The Manchin-Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban, declaring: ""Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry.""
It also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to ""allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a federal firearms registry.""
Later, it added these provisions:
• ""The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law.""
• ""The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the ... acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion thereof.""
• ""Any person who knowingly violates (the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.''
So, the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records — and added the threat of prison.
But those protections didn’t reassure gun rights proponents.
The National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation . An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it "" creates a path to a national gun registry "" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn’t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them.
She didn’t mention that existing federal law — referenced by the bill — already prohibits ""any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.""",1,Barack Obama
"Biden is ""one of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate."" Wealth has taken a beating in this presidential campaign as John McCain tries to paint Barack Obama as an elitist and Obama fires back that McCain is so rich he can't keep track of how many houses he owns.
Now, it seems, a lack of wealth is the new political badge of honor.
Just a day after Obama named Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean was on C-SPAN highlighting not only Biden's assets, but also his lack of assets, financially speaking.
""Joe Biden has certainly been a good example of a working-class kid who grew up and got himself a scholarship to a great university, worked really hard and has really made good,"" Dean said. ""One of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate, I think he remembers his roots and I think he'd tell you what a great country this is given his own experiences.""
Biden is the proverbial career politician. His main income is his salary as a U.S. senator. According to financial disclosure forms submitted on May 15, 2008, Biden's $165,200 salary as a senator in 2007 was supplemented with $20,500 he earned as an adjunct professor at Widener University Law School and a $112,500 advance he received from Random House for his book, Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics.
Biden's financial picture gets a little fuzzier after that, because although each senator's financial disclosure statement includes assets, liabilities and earnings, the form does not require exact figures; instead, officials check off a range under which each item falls.
So we know he has some income from several bank accounts, mutual funds and insurance policies.
But he also lists liabilities including loans against cash value of life insurance policies, $15,001-$50,000; a loan he co-signed to pay for his son's college expenses, $15,001-$50,000; and a line of credit with the J. Wilmington Savings Fund Society for somewhere between  $100,001 and $250,000.
The Center for Responsive Politics analyzes the possible ranges of net worth among senators and in 2006 they determined that Biden's net worth was somewhere between negative $302,980 and $277,997. But keep in mind, you don't have to declare the value of your primary residence. Property records show that Biden's three-bedroom Wilmington, Del., home has an assessed value of $525,700.
Still, in 2006, those disclosed numbers ranked Biden dead last among U.S. senators.
""In the most recent rankings, 2006, he was the least wealthy, poorest I guess you could say, of the senators,"" said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. The center has not yet completed its rankings for 2007, but Ritsch said he has seen Biden's 2007 report and his net worth ""hasn't changed much. I suspect he's still at the bottom of the list.""
It's a heady list.
Senators had a median net worth of about $1.7-million in 2006, and 58 percent of the members rated as millionaires, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan research group Center for Responsive Politics.
So where are the guys at the top of the ticket?
In 2006, Obama's net worth was estimated at somewhere between $456,012 and $1,142,000, according to a CRP analysis. That earned him a ranking of 67th. But it's a ranking that is sure to go up. Obama's 2007 tax return showed earnings of $4.2-million, based largely on the sale of his books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope.
McCain rode his wife's coattails to No. 8 in the 2006 ranking among senators, with an average net worth, $36.4-million. Much of McCain's wealth comes from his wife, Cindy McCain, who is chairman of Hensley & Co., her family's Arizona beer distributorship.
So congratulations, Sen. Biden, you are in fact one of the least, if not the least, wealthy members of the U.S. Senate. For now. We bet book sales for a vice presidential candidate will soon change that.",1,Howard Dean
"""A middle-class family donates $1 to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates $1 to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax."" In defending President Obama's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners, the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys.
They've understated the case considerably. We'll explain how in a bit. First, some background:
The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $250,000 can take as a tax deduction, from 35 to 28 percent.
That would raise about $318 billion toward Obama's proposed $634 billion ""reserve fund"" to be used to reform health care, according to Obama's budget proposal. Critics, including some Republicans and nonprofit executives, don't like the idea.
At a White House news briefing, Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, ""Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care?""
""Well, I do think all issues are on the table,"" Gibbs replied. ""Let's, though, just discuss the — I assume you're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean, a middle-class family donates a dollar to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax. The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration.""
Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in this blog post .
Let's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes. If you donate $1 to charity, you can list that as a deduction, meaning you can subtract $1 from your income before calculating your taxes.
High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $350,000. So if they subtract $1 from their taxable income, their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $1, which is 35 cents.
By contrast, couples with taxable income between $16,700 and $67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent. If they make that same $1 contribution, and subtract the $1 from their income, their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $1, or 15 cents.
Gibbs' point rests on the contention that couples making between $16,700 and $67,900 are middle class, which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is $50,233 .
So Gibbs was right, except that he understated the case. Here's how:
First, you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes. Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so, while rich folks are very likely to. Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004, but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers, according to the Urban Institute .
We're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case, because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize, and he confined his comment to the income tax.
It's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent, and an estate tax on top of that. But it's also true that a charitable contribution of, say, $1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle-class person's income than a high earner's.
That's all academic though. The bottom line is that Gibbs' number are accurate.",1,Robert Gibbs
"Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan attacked the president for ""the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget."" Bill Clinton used his nominating address at the Democratic National Convention to respond to the Republican critiques leveled at President Barack Obama during the GOP’s Tampa convention. But there was one attack in particular, he said, that ""takes some brass.""
""When Congressman (Paul) Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama's Medicare savings as, quote, the ‘biggest coldest power play,’ I didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"" Clinton said in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech in Charlotte, N.C. ""Because, that $716 billion is exactly, to the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings that he had in his own budget.
""You gotta give one thing, it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did.""
Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, is the head of the House Budget Committee and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. His idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans.
The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")
The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Ryan’s plan cuts that amount, too!
For this check, we’re looking at Clinton’s claim that Ryan attacked the president for ""the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget.""
We recently checked a similar claim from Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter that ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" We’re applying what we learned to Clinton’s remark.
$700 billion in Medicare cuts?
There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget.
Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number.
What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.
Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.
Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.
Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.
Does the Ryan budget include the same savings as the health care law?
Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget include those same reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.
Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate:
Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.""
Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" ( Read the full exchange .)
So Ryan confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.
The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks that ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget,"" and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.
""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News . ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""
Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget, as was Clinton. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the CBO.
Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the same reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. He explained a few days after Cutter’s remarks that it was only because Obama’s reduction ""was already in the baseline,"" the Wall Street Journal reported . ""We would never have done it in the first place."" The article points out, however, that the budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions.
So it was a choice to leave the reductions in place, likely because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.",1,Bill Clinton
"Says Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn’t asked for. With the country facing tough choices on spending and taxes, the defense budget, the largest single area of discretionary spending, plays a special role. In the first of three debates, President Barack Obama tried to pressure Mitt Romney on his defense plans, but the Massachusetts governor did not allow himself to be drawn in.
Obama made at least four references to Romney’s goal to greatly ramp up military spending. Each time, he did it in the context of tax policy.
""Gov. Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut,"" Obama said. ""On top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.""
Romney was happy to rebut the president’s claim about a $5 trillion tax cut but on the military, he said relatively little and he never challenged the president’s number.
""We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.,"" Romney said. ""I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.""
With both candidates seeking to rein in deficit spending, we thought we should examine whether the governor does want to add $2 trillion in defense spending.
Romney lays out his national security policy on his website. There, he warns that restoring the military ""will not be a cost-free process,"" and says he will ""begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.""
What’s 4 percent worth?
The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security , a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN .
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate.
Does Romney mean it
The Romney campaign has an interesting response to questions about proposing this increase at a time when the government has a hard time paying its bills. The staff emphasize that it might take some time to get to the 4 percent mark.
While the campaign website describes the goal as ""a floor"", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it ""a target"" in an email to a  Boston Globe  reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse ""Obama-era defense cuts.""
In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’
This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that.
What the Pentagon is asking for
The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military.
""We are developing today the Joint Force the Nation will need in 2020,"" Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. ""We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere.""
Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face.
""The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,"" Panetta told the budget c ommittee. ""We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.""
Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said ""the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.""
The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public.
Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military and by and large, the commanders support the plan.
""It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,"" Bensahel said.
Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.",1,Barack Obama
"Newt Gingrich ""has suggested"" building ""a mirror system in space"" could improve the Earth’s habitability. In a Dec. 9, 2011, column titled, ""The Gingrich Tragedy,"" New York Times columnist David Brooks expressed ambivalence about the new front-runner in the Republican presidential race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
Brooks said that ideologically, Gingrich ""comes closest to my worldview."" But Brooks added that he was repelled by Gingrich’s ""bombastic"" style and ""revolutionary temperament — intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response.""
In the column, Brooks cites negatively what he considered half-baked ideas by Gingrich. ""For example, he has called for ‘a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the moon’s resources.’ He has suggested that ‘a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways.’""
The space-mirror system seemed so outlandish that we felt compelled to check whether Gingrich really suggested it.
We e-mailed Brooks to ask where he found this quote, but we didn’t hear back. We did, however, locate a similar quote in an article by Andrew Ferguson published in the New York Times magazine on June 29, 2011. Ferguson read 21 books by Gingrich -- a famously prolific author -- in an attempt to answer his article’s titular question: ""What Does Newt Gingrich Know?""
Here’s a portion of what Ferguson wrote:
""Gingrich’s first book,  Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future , came out in 1984 and contained the seeds of much of what was to follow. Beneath its cover image — a flag-draped eagle inexplicably threatening the space shuttle— the backbencher Gingrich was identified as chairman of the congressional Space Caucus, a position that inspired a series of ‘space cadet’ jokes that took years to die. Window of Opportunity was co-written by Gingrich’s second wife, Marianne, and a science-fiction writer called David Drake.  ...
""In Window of Opportunity, Gingrich introduced himself as a futurist, a role he has played off and on throughout his career. There are problems inherent in futurism, most of them involving the future, which the futurist is obliged to predict (it’s his job) and which seldom cooperates as he would hope. Gingrich has called some and missed some. In 1984, he saw more clearly than most that computers would touch every aspect of commercial and private life, but nobody any longer wants to build ‘a large array of mirrors [that] could affect the earth’s climate,’ warming it up so farmers could extend the growing season.""
Because the quotes from Brooks and Ferguson are slightly different, we wanted to look directly at the book ourselves before making our judgment.
In the book, Gingrich proposes (among many other ideas) ""five simple steps to a bold future"" in space, most unusually a lottery in which randomly selected taxpayers would win a spot on a space shuttle flight. But the floating mirror idea isn’t on this list. Instead, it’s included in Gingrich's recap of a June 1979, NASA-sponsored new concepts symposium in Woods Hole, Mass., ""where 30 experts brainstormed a range of pioneering options for NASA worthy of Lewis and Clark.""
Here’s how Gingrich summarized the idea:
""The climate group at the Woods Hole conference suggested that a large array of mirrors could affect the earth’s climate by increasing the amount of sunlight received by particular areas, citing recent feasibility studies exploring the possibilities of preventing frosts in Florida or enabling farmers in high altitudes to plant their wheat earlier.
""A mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways. Ambient light covering entire areas could reduce the current danger of criminals lurking in the darkness. Mirrors could be arranged to light given metropolitan areas only during particular periods, so there would be darkness late at night for sleeping.""
Brooks’ portrayal glosses over the fact that Gingrich was primarily reciting proposals made by participants at a NASA-sponsored forum. Still, Gingrich cited them approvingly.
Still, we didn’t want to stop with a look at whether Brooks framed the issue fairly. We also wanted to know whether this was ever a mainstream idea -- and whether it’s technologically feasible.
One thing that’s clear is that it was not a new idea by the time it was raised at Woods Hole. At least two space pioneers promoted the concept in the 1920s, a full four decades before man landed on the moon.
Hermann Oberth (1894-1989), a scientific author based in Germany, published several books in the 1920s that anticipated the ""first rockets and satellites, … the landing on the moon, interplanetary probes, international manned space stations, and reusable space ferries,"" according to the museum that celebrates his life near Nuremberg, Germany . Among the ideas discussed in his books was ""extraterrestrial utilization of the sun's energy with huge space mirrors that beam the collected sun energy down to earth.""
These ideas were popularized in a book by another space pioneer, an Austro-Hungarian named Hermann Noordung (1892-1929) in a 1928 book,  The Problem of Space Travel: The Rocket Motor .
So the idea is an old one. But despite several decades’ worth of advances in space technology by the time Gingrich published his book, space experts and scientists told us that the idea never got much beyond the science fiction stage.
Yuri Pavlovich Semenov -- until 2005 the chief designer for Energia, the developer of Russian manned spacecraft -- ""was quite a proponent"" of the idea, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. During the Soviet era, Semenov and his allies thought such a technology could light up the northern latitudes of the USSR. However, ""it was considered impractical by the mainstream space crowd, not just technically but in terms of the potential environmental effects,"" Smith said.
John Logsdon, the founder and retired director of the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs, said that similar ideas ""have been suggested over the years by ‘out of the box’ thinkers, but they never entered the mainstream.""
Others have suggested using mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays away from the earth, as a way to attack global warming, said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
But where Gingrich’s idea is concerned, Ellegood said, ""It’s probably not even remotely cost-effective.""
Here’s another problem: ""Micro-meteorite bombardment would destroy these mirrors over a few-year time period,"" said Gregory Bothun, a University of Oregon physicist.
The experts we spoke to for this story agreed that even if the idea proposed by Gingrich in 1984 was economically and technically feasible, it would entail too many downsides to be desirable.
""Imagine a world where it never got dark! What would this do to plants, animals, my sleep, and the souls of poets and lovers everywhere?"" said Scott Denning, an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University, in an e-mail. ""Imagine having a really annoying neighbor who beams sodium vapor lamps into your bedroom windows. Now imagine everyone in the world having such a neighbor.""
Raymond S. Bradley, a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts, put it simply: ""This is not a mainstream idea. It is one of the dumbest ideas I have heard of.""",1,David Brooks
"""The president of the United States ... agrees with me"" that marriage should be between a man and a woman. It's not often that we can check a Miss USA contestant with our Truth-O-Meter. So when Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, the runner-up in the Miss USA competition, likened her much-discussed, pageant-night response to a question about gay marriage to President Barack Obama's beliefs, we decided it was time.
The similarity of the statements made by Miss California and Obama was raised during a May 12 news conference in which pageant owner Donald Trump announced that Prejean could retain her crown as Miss California USA even though she failed to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager. The Donald also came to Prejean's defense about her gay marriage comments.
""It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,"" Trump said. ""She gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart.""
Said Prejean: ""I was given a question asking for my opinion and I stated my honest belief. Not only do I hold this belief but, as Mr. Trump said, the president of the United States, the secretary of state and many Americans agree with me in this belief.""
Let's roll the tape on Prejean's statement during the Miss USA competition on April 19, 2009.
One of the celebrity judges, Perez Hilton, asked whether other states should follow Vermont's lead in legalizing same-sex marriage.
Here's the part of Prejean's answer that matters: ""I think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage  should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's  how I was raised.""
Controversy followed.
So let's see how that stacks up to Obama's stated position on same-sex marriage:
* ""You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman."" (an interview with ABC's Jake Tapper, June 16, 2008)
* ""I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it's also a sacred union. You know, God's in the mix."" (an interview with Rev. Rick Warren, Aug. 16, 2008)
* ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay  marriage."" (an MTV interview, Nov. 1, 2008)
Sounds about the same to us.
Now, we should note that with all of these quotes during the presidential campaign, Obama quickly followed up by noting his support for civil unions.
The Jake Tapper interview is as representative of Obama's fuller position as any. In it, Obama said, ""I'm a strong supporter of civil unions. ... You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I also think that same-sex partners should be able to visit each other in hospitals, they should be able to transfer property, they should be able to get the same federal rights and benefits that are conferred onto married couples. And so, you know, as president, my job is to make sure that the federal government is not discriminating and that we maintain the federal government's historic role in not meddling with what states are doing when it comes to marriage law.""
Compare that to Prejean's comments to Fox's Greta Van Susteren on April 30.
""My thought on civil unions? You know what, Greta, I don't have the answers to everything. I'm not running for political office. I don't have the answers to everything, you know, in the world out there. But I think that there should be rights for people, you know, especially in California. I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights, you know, hospital rights, and things like that.""
Granted, her answer may not be as nuanced as Obama's. As she said, she's not running for public office. Still, her fuller position also sounds an awful lot like Obama's.
But what Prejean said after the pageant isn't the issue. Prejean and The Donald said the position she took the night of the pageant is consistent with President Obama's position.",1,Miss California USA
"Obama's budget plan would ""take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. ... Historically, it's been about 40 percent."" Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, has been making the rounds on political news programs this week, criticizing President Barack Obama's budget as too costly.
Gregg has repeated one statistic over and over to make his point: that Obama's budget plan would increase the national debt to 80 percent of gross domestic product.
""Seventeen trillion dollars worth of debt at the end of 10 years, $11 trillion at the end of five years,"" Gregg said. ""This translates into a debt-to-GDP ratio which we have not seen in this country since the end of World War II when we were trying to pay off the war debt. Basically, you take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. That's the public debt. Historically, it's been about 40 percent.""
At 80 percent, Gregg has been fond of saying this week, the United States would be getting into ""banana republic"" territory.
Debt-to-GDP ratios may not get a lot of public attention, but economists follow them closely as a good indicator of economic health.
""Over the long haul, that is the most important number,"" Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage  Foundation.
Gregg's numbers come from an analysis of the Obama budget by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that the national debt would grow by $9.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 under Obama's plan. According to the CBO, the debt held by the public would rise, from 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to 57 percent in 2009 and then to 82 percent of GDP by 2019. That comports with Gregg's statement.
Projections put out by the administration's Office of Management and Budget in February were a little more optimistic, due largely to differing assumptions about the future growth of the economy. According to the White House forecasts, the national debt-to-GDP ration would rise to 67 percent in 2019.
Still, by either count, the debt-to-GDP ratios are climbing.
Gregg is right that since the post-World War II years, debt-to-GDP has averaged about 42 percent. He's also right that if the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 82 percent in 2019, that would be a level we have not seen in the United States since World War II. According to historical budget tables, the debt-to-GDP ratios actually climbed over 100 percent, peaking at 109 percent in 1946. Since then, the ratios have spiked occasionally as a result of recession or war, but have never gone above about 50 percent. That will change this year.
It's less clear if that 82 percent would put us in the ""banana republic"" range. According to the
CIA World Factbook,
the United States has the 22nd highest level of public debt as a percentage of GDP in the world. There are no separate statistics for banana republics, but it's worth noting that many Latin American countries have a lower public debt ratio than the United States.
Regardless, Gregg is right that 82 percent would be remarkably high and put the country in unenviable company.
So why should we care?
If the debt-to-GDP level were to go to 82 percent, Heritage's Riedl said, ""It's a simple fact that interest rates would go through the roof.""
Moreover, he said, it would be harder for companies to borrow money; harder for people to get mortgages. It would decrease productivity and overall economic growth.
""It's just not a sustainable ratio,"" Riedl said.
Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan  organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits, also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years, interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget.
Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the ""out years"" of budget  projections because ""none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight  or 10 years from now."" And Obama has said that making investments today in education, health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy, which presumably would create a better debt-to-GDP ratio.
Gregg is on solid ground, relying on projections from the CBO, a highly respected, nonpartisan arm of Congress, about the long-term debt-to-GDP ratios.",1,Judd Gregg
"""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been trying to court black voters ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary by talking about the need to address systemic racism.
In a 30-second commercial , Clinton says: ""Something is just fundamentally broken when African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.""
We wanted to see if there's evidence that being black influences whether someone will be arrested and, once convicted, ordered to do more time.
HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER
The question plays out against a stark statistic — although African-Americans make up 13 percent of the general population , they account for 36 percent of the inmate population, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Risk of arrest
A heap of evidence shows African-Americans are arrested at higher rates.
The Clinton campaign pointed out a Washington Post blog post (referring to a Brookings Institution piece ) that said blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.
The campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments ""arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,"" the paper reported.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.)
The Sentencing Project , an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher — 12 percent — and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).
Not only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop.
In a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City .
It's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.
What surveys have shown ""is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,"" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. ""But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.""
Sentencing
There is also evidence for Clinton’s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.
Studies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology.
A 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal  reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.
After controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.
The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity ""accumulates at each level,"" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.
""You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,"" she said. ""As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages.""
Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but ""it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about.
""If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,"" Tonry said. ""If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.""
How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers.
And sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer.",1,Hillary Clinton
"When the United States invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and ""he said so himself after his capture."" Sen. John McCain visited St. Petersburg, Fla., on June 4, 2008, to raise money for his presidential campaign, and sat down with St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith for an interview.
McCain criticized his opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, as inexperienced, especially in foreign policy.
When asked about Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war when others, including McCain, thought it was necessary, McCain defended the invasion, saying the intelligence community believed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.
Smith pointed out that Florida's Bob Graham, former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, opposed the war, too.
""I respect Sen. Graham enormously,"" McCain said. ""But I don't think there's any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was — and he said so himself after his capture — to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction.""
Most of what McCain said here has been heavily discussed, but we were intrigued by the very last sentence in McCain's quote, in which he says that Hussein had said after his capture that he intended to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. True?
Among the most definitive records yet produced on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction is a report from the Iraq Survey Group, a group affiliated with the CIA. It released its initial report in 2004 and a concluding addenda in 2005. The report stated that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction during the run-up to the U.S. invasion in 2003.
The detailed report, which runs more than 1,000 pages, emphasizes that the story of Iraq's weapons is complex and unfolded over many years. One complicating factor was Hussein's repressive style of leadership, in which he often avoided direct discussion of sensitive military matters. Another was his desire to pursue multiple goals that sometimes conflicted with each other. After the Persian Gulf War of 1991, for example, Hussein very much wanted to present his country as an imposing military presence to avoid invasion by either the United States or Iran. But he also wanted to satisfy weapons inspectors and stop international sanctions that were causing economic problems for his country.
The report concluded that Hussein did away with his weapons program in the years after the Persian Gulf War, but deliberately encouraged ambiguity about whether his regime possessed the weapons or not. Hussein believed the threat of weapons would act as a deterrent to Iran and the United States. The report also said that Hussein intended to restart the program after the scrutiny of the international community was off him. Though that prospect could have been years off, Hussein kept weapons experts employed in the country for that purpose.
But, what about Hussein's remarks after he was captured? Here's what we know:
The Iraq Survey Group interviewed scores of people, including Hussein's top advisers. After his capture in 2003 by the U.S. government, the survey group gained access to information gleaned from Hussein during detention.
In 2008, Hussein's interrogator for the group, George Piro of the FBI, gave a lengthy interview to Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes in which he discussed what Hussein said while in custody.
Piro, a native Arabic speaker, said that Hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again.
""What weapons of mass destruction did he intend to pursue again once he had the opportunity?"" Pelley asked.
""He wanted to pursue all of WMD,"" Piro said. ""So he wanted to reconstitute his entire WMD program.""
""Chemical, biological, even nuclear?"" Pelley asked.
""Yes,"" Piro said.
McCain's statement was quite specific: He said Hussein intended to acquire weapons, not that he had them. That's what our review of the evidence shows. Granted, the evidence was compiled by the U.S. intelligence community, the same group that got the weapons question wrong before the invasion. But it's the best record publicly available, and it supports McCain's statement. Hussein told Piro that he did want to pursue weapons of mass destruction someday.",1,John McCain
"""I don't do earmarks. I've never done one. I'm not going to do one."" When House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, urged President Obama to veto the $410 billion omnibus spending bill because of all the earmarks in it, he spoke from particularly high ground on the issue.
""I don't do earmarks,"" Boehner said in a news conference on March 12, 2009. ""I've never done one. I'm not going to do one.""
Indeed, that's what he promised back in 1990 when he was first running for Congress. He often says he told voters, ""If you are electing me to raid the federal treasury on your behalf, you're electing the wrong guy.""
For eighteen years, Boehner says he hasn't wavered.
A strict earmark-free record would put him in rare company, so we decided to check it out.
""He hasn't taken any,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that doggedly tracks earmarks. ""He has bragged about that long before this ever became a big deal, and he's right.""
We reviewed press coverage of Boehner since he was elected and couldn't find any either.
We did find several instances where local officials pushing for various highway projects ran up against Boehner's hard line. In an article in the
Dayton Daily News
in 2002, one official lamented that his area would have difficulty getting federal money for a highway project because of the congressman's policy.
""If you're looking for a congressman to go after a bunch of earmarks, he's not your guy,'"" said Bryan Bucklew, vice president of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce.
It's a principled stance that hasn't always sat well with fellow Republican legislators who believe in earmarks, either.
But Boehner has stuck to his pledge. In May 2008, he told the
Wall Street Journal,
""It might have been the best decision I ever made.""
Yet despite his personal ban, Boehner has never argued for earmarks to be eliminated completely.
""I don't think I want to hold all my colleagues to that same standard,"" Boehner said in a
Fox News Sunday
interview on Feb. 5, 2006. ""There's an appropriate place for some of these earmarks, but we need less numbers of earmarks and more transparency and more accountability. Members' names ought to be associated with them. They ought to be visible. And members ought to have a chance to see these before they become law.""
This year, Boehner was joined in eschewing earmarks by other House Republican leaders: Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. But in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., sponsored or cosponsored 53 earmarks worth $75.5 million, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.
All told, TCS counted more than 8,500 disclosed earmarks in the omnibus bill, coming to $7.7 billion. Together with $6.6 billion in disclosed earmarks in the three 2009 spending bills that passed in the fall, earmarks for the year come to $14.3 billion, which is $500 million less than earmarks last year. As is the custom, Republicans, as the minority party, got about 40 percent of them.
Of the 178 Republican House members, only 39 did not have earmarks in the omnibus, according to TCS. Three Democrats did not accept earmarks.
As for Boehner, he can rightfully claim he hasn't ever asked for or taken an earmark. We rule his statement True.",1,John Boehner
"Senators who have accepted millions in campaign contributions from the financial industry voted against allowing bankruptcy judges to modify home mortgages. With record numbers of foreclosures looming, consumer advocates have been hoping Congress would make it easier for people in bankruptcy to have their home mortgages modified.
When you declare bankruptcy, you go into federal court and formally admit that you can no longer pay your debts. A judge then takes over to broker agreements between you and the people or businesses you owe.
Federal or state laws can govern the bankruptcy process, and rules differ by state. But under federal rules, judges can't change the terms of a home mortgage. They can, however, modify the terms of any mortgage that is not a primary residence, such as vacation homes.
Critics of the rule say it is unfair to people of more modest means, and that the rules should allow judges to lower the principal, cut interest rates or extend the terms of repayment. Measures allowing these things are known as ""cramdown"" legislation, because they typically force the lender to reduce the debt. The financial industry has opposed the measure because they say it will cost the banks money, and they will be required to raise interest rates on new mortgage customers.
The Senate voted against cramdown legislation on April 30, 2009, killing an amendment on a 45-51 vote. President Barack Obama supported the legislation.
The liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org has created advertisements targeting seven Democratic senators who voted against the legislation, which it calls ""commonsense bankruptcy reform.""
The ads are virtually identical. Here's the script for the ad about Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter recently switched parties and was a Democrat at the time of the vote.)
""Last week, Sen. Specter had a choice.  Wall Street was trying to kill the president's proposal to help families facing foreclosure. Sen. Specter could side with the banks, or with Pennsylvania families.                                                      Sen. Specter has taken close to $6 million from the financial industry.    So what did he do? Exactly what the banks wanted.     And now millions of people will lose their homes because of it.            Tell Sen. Specter to stand up for us — not the banks.""
We wanted to check MoveOn's math about what the senators had collected from the financial industry. We turned to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign contributions.
Here's the list of senators that MoveOn targeted, what MoveOn said they raised from the financial industry, and what the Center for Responsive Politics showed:
• Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa. — ""close to $6 million"" — career total: $5,753,310
• Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. — ""close to $3 million"" — career total: $3,020,966
• Sen. Ben Nelson, D.-Neb. — ""close to $3 million"" — career total: $2,667,406
• Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. — ""close to $2 million"" — career total: $2,160,628
• Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. — ""close to $2 million"" — career total: $1,671,292
• Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. — ""close to $2 million"" — career total: $2,399,134
• Sen. Mark Pryor, D. Ark. — ""close to $1 million"" — career total: $1,321,948
The category is for ""Finance, Insurance and Real Estate,"" and that includes the following types of businesses: commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions, finance/credit companies, securities and investment, venture capital, hedge funds, private equity and investment firms, insurance, real estate, mortgage bankers and brokers, and accountants.
We should note here that five other Democrats voted against the measure but were not targeted by MoveOn. A representative for MoveOn told us that those senators had either accepted less money from the financial industry or had a better overall voting record on MoveOn's core issues. Those senators included: Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; and Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.
Getting back to the ads, MoveOn says the senators voted with Wall Street and the banks after accepting campaign contributions from them. We can't say if there is a cause and effect, but MoveOn is right about how the senators voted. MoveOn approximates numbers for the campaign contributions — and clearly labels them approximations — and those numbers closely track the actual data from the Center for Responsive Politics. We rule MoveOn's collective statement that senators accepted millions in campaign contributions and voted against cramdown legislation as True.",1,MoveOn.org
"The tax penalty that the government imposes if you don't buy health insurance ""is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance."" Following President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, three freshmen Republican members of Congress appeared on Greta Van Susteren’s Fox News show to offer their reactions.
The panel focused on the need to address the nation’s debt problem, but the discussion also turned to a favorite Republican point of attack: Obamacare.
Ron DeSantis, who represents northeast Florida including St. Augustine, Daytona Beach, and areas near Jacksonville, predicted that the health care law will put negative pressure on the insurance market.
""It's structured in a way I think is going to end up failing,"" DeSantis said. ""The tax that they put on you to buy insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance, so I think a lot of people are going to pay the tax and that's going to destabilize the insurance market. And I think you will see problems with increased costs.""
We can’t fact-check DeSantis’ prediction, but we were interested in DeSantis’ claim that the tax penalty imposed by the law is less than the cost of insurance. We decided to check it out.
What’s in the law
The law’s individual mandate requires most adults in the U.S. to carry insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty. The tax is either a specific amount or a percentage of income, whichever is greater, and it’s phased in over time. Here is how the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it:
""Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.""
At most middle-income levels, the percentage of income is greater than the flat fee. Here are a few examples of what the tax would cost:
An individual with $30,000 annual income would pay a $300 penalty in 2014, $600 in 2015 and $750 in 2016.
An individual with $50,000 annual income would pay a $500 penalty in 2014, $1,000 in 2015 and $1,250 in 2016.
An individual earning $100,000 a year would pay a $1,000 penalty in 2014, $2,000 in 2015 and $2,500 in 2016.
Married couples would pay double those amounts since the penalties are assessed per person. Families will eventually pay up to $2,085, or 2.5 percent of household income, by 2016. After 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.
The cost of insurance
The health care law also establishes insurance exchanges, essentially marketplaces in each state where people can purchase health insurance.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the national average annual premium in an Exchange in 2016 would be about $5,000 for an individual and about $12,000 for a family for the lowest-cost coverage that will be available.
DeSantis’ office pointed us to another survey which said employer-sponsored insurance premiums rose to an average of $5,615 in 2012 for individuals and $15,745 for family coverage, though those figures do not represent what employees themselves paid toward their plans in the form of premiums.
So it’s clear that even for those making high incomes -- the penalty in 2016 on a $200,000 income would be $4,500 -- the overall cost of insurance is greater than the tax.
""The point Congressman DeSantis was making is that under Obamacare the penalty intended to force you to buy health insurance is less expensive than the average annual premium. In which case, many individuals may opt to pay the penalty instead of purchasing insurance in the marketplace,"" DeSantis’ communications director, Amy Graham, told PolitiFact in an email.
Other views
We talked to two experts for their take on DeSantis’ claim. They agreed that dollar-for-dollar, the tax is less than the cost of insurance.
But the matter is about more than just the math.
""People buy health insurance for stability, making sure they aren’t bankrupted by a car accident or heart attack,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor who studies health policy at Washington and Lee School of Law who supports the law. ""For a lot of those people they’re going to decide they’d rather pay a bit more for insurance and have something than pay the penalty and be uninsured.""
Clint Stretch, a tax attorney in Washington, also pointed out that the penalty is not meant to be a better deal than health insurance. It’s meant to nudge the uninsured toward buying coverage.
""Assume an individual could get coverage for $3,000 or not get it and suffer a $1,000 penalty. All else being equal, the law has made the decision to buy insurance a $2,000 decision rather than a $3,000 decision,"" Stretch said in an email. ""In effect the taxpayer’s choice is pay the Treasury or pay the insurance company – if they pay the Treasury they get no benefit.""
Jost added that many people who are subject to the penalty will benefit from other functions of the health care law, such as Medicaid, the health program for the poor that is expanded under Obamacare. There are also tax credits to help people pay for premiums and existing employer-sponsored plans.
""If it were just a question of do I pay $2,000 (or insurance) or $700 (in a tax penalty), yeah that’s pretty much a no brainer,"" Jost said. ""But on the other hand if I can get insurance through my employer for $200 a month and the alternative is not to do that and pay the penalty, it becomes a closer calculation.""",1,Ron DeSantis
"Barack Obama and the Democrats have ""proposed a tax for not having health insurance."" The Republican National Committee launched a new ad attacking health care reform as a big tax increase.
""Barack Obama and Democrats promise that health care reform will lower costs, but their plans deliver increased taxes,"" the ad says. It then lists several taxes it says the Obama plan will increase.
Here we're checking the claim that ""they've even proposed a tax for not having health insurance.""
The ad then flashes to video of Obama and George Stephanopoulos arguing over the meaning of the word tax on
This Week with George Stephanopoulos
, with Stephanopolous reading the dictionary definition. Obama said the measure is necessary to make sure that everyone takes responsibility for having health insurance. He also said that a tax penalty is not the same thing as raising people's taxes.
The tax in the Democrats' bills won't affect anyone who has insurance. But if health care reform passes, it will be an issue for those who don't have insurance.
The tax is the mechanism that Democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage. If they fail to get insurance, they would have to pay it.
We've studied the health reform proposals being considered in Congress right now, and the main Democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who don't carry health insurance. Policymakers usually call this provision the ""individual mandate.""
Among Democrats, there is much consensus that an individual mandate is needed to make sure everyone is covered, especially when coupled with other measures to make affordable coverage more widely available.
Obama opposed the individual mandate when he was a candidate, but he has since changed his mind and now supports it, as long as it contains a hardship exemption for individuals who are truly unable to find affordable coverage.
The proposals in Congress each handle the individual mandate differently.
In the bills in the House of Representatives, a person who failed to get coverage would face a penalty of 2.5 percent of their modified adjusted gross income up to the cost of basic health insurance, as defined by the new national health insurance exchange. The House grants exemptions for dependents, religious objections and financial hardship.
In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee caps the penalty at $750. It exempts residents of states that don't establish health insurance exchanges, those for whom affordable coverage is not available, and those without coverage for fewer than 90 days.
The Senate Finance Comittee specifies a tax penalty of $950 for an individual and a maximum penalty of $1,900 per family. The penalties are a little lower if the person's income is below 300 percent of the poverty level. People are exempt from the mandate if they live below the poverty level, if the lowest cost insurance exceeds 10 percent of their income, or if there is financial hardship or religious objections.
We should note that the bills tend to leave the definitions of financial hardship up to other officials, such as the secretary of Health and Human Services.
We're going to duck, for now, the question asked by Stephanopolous, about whether Obama is breaking his promise on raising taxes. If health reform passes, then we'll evaluate the mandate with respect to our Obameter campaign promises database . Promise No. 515, ""No family making less than $250,000 will see 'any form of tax increase,'"" is currently rated Compromise .
The details for these mandates are very much a work in progress, and Congress will ultimately have to vote on one set of standards for the mandate. But all of the Democratic plans include the mandate, which is a tax penalty on those who don't have insurance. The RNC called it ""a tax for not having health insurance,"" and there's no doubt that it is a form of tax. There are provisions for those who face hardship, but absent special circumstances, everyone will have to have coverage.",1,Republican National Committee
"Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal cuts ""nothing"" from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and ""in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt."" President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases.
Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments.
Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved , mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan.
Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline.
""I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem,"" Stockman said. ""Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.""
We decided to fact-check Stockman's attack on Ryan's proposal. We'll take it point by point with Truth-O-Meter rulings along the way to our final ruling.
Ryan's proposal ""leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years.""
Ryan's resolution specifically exempts current retirees and those near retirement. This means traditional Medicare would stay in place for those 55 or older. So we wouldn't see reductions in the rate of spending on Medicare until about 2022.
Ryan's budget proposal as passed by the House of Representatives is only a broad outline, but Ryan's staff provided additional details of his plan to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, so that the CBO could conduct its usual fiscal analysis. The CBO reported that Ryan's plan leaves in place a number of cost-saving provisions that are part of health care reform, but those cost savings are part of current law, not new reductions.
So Ryan's budget does indeed leave Medicare alone for the near-term.
Ryan's proposal ""leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years.""
Ryan's ""Path to Prosperity"" asserts that Social Security is out of balance and in ""fragile condition,"" but it doesn't suggest any immediate changes to the program. Instead, the proposal says the president should submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund, and that members of Congress should also be required to put forth ideas. The CBO report plainly states, ""The proposal does not involve changes to Social Security.""
Ryan's proposal ""leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years.""
Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested  additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it.
Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects ""deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense."" (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more , while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.)
We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, ""the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years,"" Harrison said via e-mail.
We rate this part Mostly True, allowing for the fact that there are some small reductions that Ryan and the Obama administration both agree on.
In three years, Ryan ""does not cut one dime from the debt.""
As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year.
Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The ""Path to Prosperity"" document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021.
So Stockman's right on this one, too. True.
Other viewpoints
We checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as ""common sense gradual reforms,"" and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget.
""Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs,"" said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail.
Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said.
Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: ""Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks.""",1,David Stockman
"Tax rates were significantly higher ""in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s."" In a free-wheeling interview on the Fox News Network, Bill O'Reilly and Hillary Clinton mixed it up over gas prices, health care, and taxes.
On taxes, Clinton and O'Reilly argued about what tax rates were like when their fathers were working.
Clinton: ""You were growing up on Long Island. I was growing up outside of Chicago. You know, my dad got up every day. He was a small business man. He worked his head off, but he didn't feel like the deck was stacked against him. He thought, OK, I'm going to be treated fairly if I do my part.""
O'Reilly: ""Here's where you're wrong. In my neighborhood, Levittown, there was no income distribution at all. There was earning money. And you kept most of it because taxes were really low.""
Clinton: ""That is not true. Look at the tax rates in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s.""
O'Reilly: ""For the wealthy they were high, but not for my dad.""
Clinton: ""Well, so why don't we go back to what we had in the '50s and the '60s then? Go back to 70 percent...""
O'Reilly: ""Because there were no wealthy people then. There were very, very few.""
Clinton: ""When President Kennedy made that dramatic announcement he was going to cut the top rate from 90 percent to 70 percent, people stood up and cheered. All I want to do is get back to what worked in the '90s.""
We wondered who was right in this exchange and what the tax rates were when Clinton and O'Reilly were young.
Today, tax rates range from 10 percent for lower incomes to 35 percent for the highest incomes. (See a chart of tax rates over time from the Tax Foundation here .)
Kennedy urged tax cuts that went into effect in 1964. Prior to that, tax rates started at 20 percent for the lowest bracket and went up to 91 percent for the highest bracket. The rates were similar throughout the 1940s and 1950s.
We looked at incomes and tax rates in 1963, then adjusted for inflation and looked at today's tax rates.
We found:
* A person making $2,500 a year in 1963 was taxed at 22 percent. Today that would be $17,445, taxed at 15 percent.
* A person making $5,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 26 percent. Today that would be $34,890, taxed at 25 percent.
* A person making $10,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 34 percent. Today that would be $69,780, taxed at 25 percent.
* A person making $15,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 47 percent. Today that would be $104,670, taxed at 28 percent.
* A person making $25,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 59 percent. Today that would be  $174,450, taxed at 33 percent.
The 1963 rates are higher than today's rates. It's true that the tax code is substantially different today, with many credits and rules that didn't exist then. But on the question of income tax rates, we find that Hillary Clinton has her history right.",1,Hillary Clinton
"Says Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting for the Iraq war. Trying to counter Sen. Hillary Clinton's questions about his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama accused the New York senator of bungling the biggest foreign policy vote of her career by authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 without first reading the National Intelligence Estimate – a forecast by the nation's intelligence services of potential developments that could affect national security.
To underscore his point, Obama noted that former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time, voted against the resolution, citing dissents in the document, primarily from the State and Energy departments, to intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.
""If you have a National Intelligence Estimate and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says, 'You should read this, this is why I'm voting against the war,' you should read it,"" Obama said in a speech in Westerville, Ohio, on March 1.
Obama didn't serve in the Senate when the chamber cleared the use-of-force resolution, 77-23, on Oct. 11, 2002, but spoke against the war while serving as an Illinois state senator.
To evaluate the vote on the resolution, one has to consider the ambivalence and fears about war that filled Congress at the time. With the memory of the Sept. 11 terror attacks fresh in everyone's mind, many lawmakers worried that the failure to give Bush the power to act against Iraq would make the United States more vulnerable to further attacks. Others were concerned they would be labeled unpatriotic if they voted against a popular president in the weeks before a national election. Many who had questioned Bush's talk of war wound up joining in a broad coalition behind the president.
As a presidential candidate, Clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire National Intelligence Estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from high-level Bush administration officials. The book Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton , by New York Times reporters Jeff Gerth and Don van Natta Jr., first suggested she did not read the report.
""I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that. I was briefed by the people from, you know, the State Department, the CIA, the Department of Defense; all of the various players in that,"" Clinton said in a Jan. 13, 2008, appearance on Meet the Press. ""Some people read it and voted for the resolution, some people read it and voted against the resolution. I felt very well briefed.""
Clinton sidestepped host Tim Russert's question about whether she read it, but she did not challenge his assertion that she had not. Instead, she emphasized that she spoke with the authors of the report.
The back-and-forth is casting new attention on the National Intelligence Estimate, versions of which have been prepared since 1946, at the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The documents are periodically requested by administration officials, military commanders or members of Congress and produced by the National Intelligence Council, which serves as the intelligence community's forecast center and reports directly to the director of National Intelligence. All of the nation's intelligence agencies have an opportunity to weigh in on the reports.
Graham, in a 2005 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, said a careful reading of the National Intelligence Estimate revealed it didn't contain the rationale for a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Graham said he exercised the intelligence committee's prerogative during the run-up to the war and demanded that then-CIA Director George Tenet prepare a classified estimate in September 2002 after learning the White House had not requested one and that none was being prepared.
The resulting 92-page document, in Graham's opinion, was slanted toward the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction at 550 sites, but contained what he called ""vigorous dissents,"" especially about aluminum tubes that were offered as evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program.
Clinton was far from the only member of Congress to rely on in-person briefings instead of actually reading the document.
To read the report, members of Congress had to go to a secure location in the U.S. Capitol. The Washington Post reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of representatives had logged and read the report beyond a five-page executive summary.
In the end, 29 out of 50 Democrats in the chamber voted in favor of the resolution, rejecting arguments by opponents led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that it amounted to giving President Bush unlimited authority to wage war, akin to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing military action during the Vietnam War.",1,Barack Obama
"West Virginia ""has the highest overdose death rate in the nation."" As he runs for a U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., is seeking targeted funding for states grappling with opioid addiction.
Jenkins co-sponsored the Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act with Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and several other lawmakers, including fellow West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinley.
The legislation, which awaits action in a House committee, would clarify that per capita overdose deaths should be a factor in distributing funding from the 21st Century Cures Act, a law passed in 2016 by overwhelming majorities in Congress and then signed into law by President Barack Obama.
In a March 20, 2018, press release to promote the bill, Jenkins wrote, ""The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.""
Is Jenkins correct that West Virginia has ""the highest overdose death rate in the nation""? Yes, according to official statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For the most recent full year for which data is available, 2016, the CDC reported that West Virginia had the highest death rate due to drug overdoses. Here’s a list of the top five states, which also include Kuster’s home state of New Hampshire.
The comparison isn’t close: West Virginia’s drug overdose death rate is a full one-third higher than the state with the second-highest rate, Ohio.
On May 8, Jenkins will face West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the Republican Senate primary. The winner will challenge the state’s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin.",1,Evan Jenkins
"McCain is ""raising campaign cash with one of (Jack) Abramoff's closest business partners: scandal-plagued conservative activist Ralph Reed."" Critics of Sen. John McCain have seized on news that controversial political strategist Ralph Reed is helping McCain's campaign. The Democratic National Committee piled on in a recent news release.
""On the campaign trail, John McCain likes to brag about chairing the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that investigated criminal lobbyist Jack Abramoff's role in the Republican culture of corruption,"" the DNC said in the Aug. 13 release. ""But that is not stopping John McCain from raising campaign cash with one of Abramoff's closest business partners: scandal-plagued conservative activist Ralph Reed.""
Reed is the former executive director of the Christian Coalition and currently a principal of the political consulting company Century Strategies. He was credited as a key operative in George W. Bush's sharp-elbowed effort against McCain in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary in 2000. McCain, in turn, chaired the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2006 when it investigated and unveiled Reed's deep personal and business ties to Abramoff, a lobbyist who pleaded guilty to three felonies.
So it came as a surprise to many political observers when the Atlanta-Journal Constitution recently published on its Political Insider blog a copy of an Aug. 7 e-mail message from Reed to Republicans around Georgia, inviting them to an Aug. 18 fundraiser for McCain Victory 2008, a committee that supports McCain's presidential run.
The paper followed up with a piece in which Reed acknowledged he ""sent that e-mail out,"" but said he did so ""in my capacity as a private citizen.""
McCain Victory 2008 is a joint fundraising committee made up of the McCain campaign, the Republican National Committee and several state affiliates. Its purpose is to support McCain's presidential run, so it is fair to characterize its fundraising events as McCain campaign efforts.
So yes, Reed and McCain are raising cash together. (There is speculation that McCain may cancel the fundraiser, but Reed's e-mail included a contribution form, so McCain's campaign and Reed are indeed actively ""raising campaign cash"" together.)
Now for the allegation that Reed is a ""scandal-plagued conservative activist"" and ""one of Abramoff's closest business partners.""
It is accurate that Reed was severely tainted, though never charged criminally, as a result of the scandals that enveloped Abramoff. A longtime conservative lobbyist, Abramoff represented Indian tribes in the gambling business, and pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiring to corrupt public officials and cheating some tribes out of tens of millions of dollars.
Reed was friends with Abramoff. Their business ties dated at least to 1998, when Reed e-mailed Abramoff: ""Hey, now that I'm done with electoral politics, I need to start humping in corporate accounts! I'm counting on you to help me with some contacts.""
That e-mail and heaps of other information about Reed's ties to Abramoff were unveiled in a 2006 report by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , which McCain chaired at the time.
Abramoff arranged for Reed and his companies to receive $5.3-million to gin up opposition among Christian groups to gambling operations that would have competed with those of Abramoff's tribal clients, the Senate report said.
Abramoff ""had each tribe use conduits to implement their grass-roots campaigns,"" the report said. ""Over time, those tribes became accustomed to (1) paying substantial fees for their grass-roots activities and (2) paying those fees to or through conduits. …The vendor that Abramoff and (Abramoff's partner Michael) Scanlon used, and relied on, the most to implement those campaigns was former Christian Coalition Executive Director and political strategist Ralph Reed.""
For example, Reed was hired to help defeat video poker machines at dog tracks, which would have competed with Abramoff's clients' casinos. Reed boasted in a letter to Abramoff: ""Century Strategies has on file over 3,000 pastors and 90,000 religious conservative households in Alabama that can be accessed in this effort,"" the Senate report said.
Reed did not return calls for comment on the DNC's news release. He said in a 2006 statement that he agreed to organize antigambling campaigns only after he was assured he ""would not be paid with funds derived from gambling."" Reed subsequently lost a 2006 Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Georgia.
Reed's name appears 197 times in the Senate report, which ties him to numerous unseemly Abramoff efforts. So yes, he was one of Abramoff's closest business partners, and he was plagued by scandal as a result.
The DNC's news release does not note that the Abramoff-Reed partnership and Reed's scandals are in the past, and it could be read to imply that they continue today. Strictly speaking, however, the release avoids attaching a tense to its charges about Reed.",1,Democratic National Committee
"According to a recent poll, ""there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' (health insurance) plans than young Democrats."" During a speech to support President Barack Obama’s health care law, former President Bill Clinton offered a juicy bit of polling data about one of the law’s provisions -- one that allows young Americans to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies up to the age of 26. He said more young Republicans are on their parents’ plans than young Democrats.
Clinton, speaking at his presidential center in Little Rock, Ark., on Sept. 4, 2013, said the option to stay on a parent’s policy up to age 26 is a key element of Obama’s law, because it helps keep younger Americans covered. Some young people, presuming they won’t ever get sick, might otherwise be tempted to skip purchasing insurance coverage altogether.
Clinton went on to cite data from recent polling by the Commonwealth Fund showing that ""large numbers of young people aged 26 and younger have already enrolled in their parents' plans. And interestingly enough -- if I were you guys, I'd promote this, (saying) these Republicans are the personal responsibility party -- there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' plans than young Democrats.""
The irony that young supporters of the GOP -- the party that has repeatedly tried to repeal or defund Obama’s law -- are actually using this part of the law more than young Democrats are led to chuckles in the audience.
We wondered: Is Clinton’s tidbit correct?
We turned to the Commonwealth Fund study in question . The fund is a 95-year-old group that aims to ""promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society's most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, minority Americans, young children, and elderly adults."" The fund is nonpartisan but generally seen as supportive of Obama’s law.
The fund conducted two polls of young Americans -- one taken in November 2011, the other taken in February and March 2013. Unlike traditional telephone polls, this survey uses Internet respondents drawn from a sample that, by design, closely mirrors the demographic patterns of the population at large. In 2013, the pollsters invited 3,530 adults aged 19 to 29 to complete the 2013 online questionnaire. More than half responded, producing a margin of sampling error of slightly more than 3 percentage points.
Here’s a summary of what the pollsters found in 2013 when they asked whether a survey participant age 19 to 25 had, in the past 12 months, opted to stay on or enroll in their parents’ health plan:
So, Clinton was right -- 63 percent of young Republicans, compared to only 45 percent of young Democrats had signed on to their parents’ plan, something they couldn’t have done without passage of Obama’s law.
Sara R. Collins, vice president of Affordable Health Insurance for the Commonwealth Fund, provided us with some additional details about the survey. The survey included 1,001 respondents between 19 and 25 who were asked whether they consider themselves Republican, Democrat or Independent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents, or 285 people, considered themselves Democrats, while 26 percent, or 259 people, self-identified as Republicans.
Because the question Clinton cited only concerned a portion of the people polled, the answers come with a higher margin of error than the overall poll. Collins said the Commonwealth Fund did not determine a sampling error for this specific question but found the results ""statistically significant."" Put another way, the results are reliable.
""President Clinton’s statement is accurate,"" Collins said. ""The difference between young adults who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats enrolled on their parents' policies is statistically significant in the survey.  A greater share of young adults who identify themselves as Republicans are estimated to have enrolled on their parents' plans than did young adults who identified themselves as Democrats.""
For what it’s worth, the partisan variation was more pronounced in 2013 than it was in 2011. That year, respondents of all three partisan affiliations had much closer rates of signing up for a parent’s plan -- 50 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Independents.",1,Bill Clinton
"Says Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping. The campaign of Sen. John McCain, eager to portray Sen. Barack Obama as someone who won't stick to his principles, has alleged that Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping.
McCain's spokesman said Obama reversed a vow to filibuster any bill that immunized phone companies from lawsuits for letting the government eavesdrop on their customers without warrants.
""A few short months ago, Barack Obama outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation, saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for American telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program,"" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a news release on July 9, 2008. ""Today, the U.S. Senate will approve legislation providing the immunity Barack Obama supposedly opposed, and despite his promise, he will not support a filibuster.""
At issue is a surveillance program launched by the National Security Agency after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The agency asked telecommunications companies such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to help it monitor the international calls and e-mails of customers in the United States without warrants.
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires court approval for domestic surveillance. Anyone who violates the law is subject to fines of up to $10,000 or five years in prison.
So after the New York Times exposed the wiretapping program in 2005, the telecommunications companies were vulnerable to lawsuits from irate customers. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 46 lawsuits have been filed against the phone companies.
The Bush administration asked Congress last year to grant the telecom companies immunity from the lawsuits. McCain and most other Republicans supported a measure that would do so, but some Democratic leaders, under pressure from liberal bloggers and civil liberties advocates, opposed it.
Obama was one of those leaders.
In October 2007, Obama spokesman Bill Burton issued this unequivocal statement to the liberal blog TPM Election Central: ""To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.""
Key segments of the Democratic base — enjoying substantial influence in the run-up to the Democratic presidential primaries — were pleased. ""This is the kind of leadership we need to see from the Democratic candidates,"" MoveOn spokesman Adam Green said at the time.
But recently the Senate again took up legislation that would let the phone companies off the hook. It would also expand the government's domestic spying powers.
Obama supported an amendment that would have stripped telecom immunity from the measure. But after that amendment failed, Obama declined to filibuster the bill. In fact, he voted for it. It passed the Senate, 69-28, on July 9. The House passed the same bill last month, and Bush said he would sign it soon. (McCain missed the vote because he was campaigning in Ohio, but he has consistently supported the immunity plan.)
In a message to supporters, Obama defended his position, citing a phrase Democrats fought to include that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the ""exclusive"" means of wiretapping for intelligence. The bill ""is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court.""
Obama also cited a provision requiring several inspectors general — who are internal government watchdogs — to investigate the program.  ""It will allow a close look at past misconduct without hurdles that would exist in federal court because of classification issues,"" Obama said.
None of that, however, negates Obama's promise to filibuster ""any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies."" He declined to do so.
Obama's campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But in this case, it's clear that the McCain campaign's accusation of a flip-flop is True.",1,John McCain
"A report by the health insurance industry ""ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill."" The day before an important vote in a Senate committee, the health insurance industry group released a report saying that health care reform will dramatically increase the cost of insurance.
The Obama administration attacked the report as a last-ditch effort to derail reform.
""I was disappointed to see that the health insurance industry had contrived a report like this at the last minute, right on the eve of a historic vote,"" said Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform.
The report ""ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill, such as the health insurance exchange, which is really a central feature that allows people to be pooled together to save administrative costs and to lower people's cost in achieving getting coverage,"" DeParle said.
For this item, we're checking DeParle's statement that the report ignores parts of the bill that would reduce costs.
The 26-page report was put together by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It examined four parts of a bill under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee.
The report examined four separate parts of the bill and found that all of them would increase costs for health insurance companies and health care providers. These increased costs would then most likely be passed on to consumers.
Among the report's complaints about the Finance Committee bill:
• Weak mandate.
The legislation requires insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions. The report says this might be all right if everyone were required to buy insurance, but the rules requiring people to buy coverage are weak and take too long to phase in. That means insurers would have to raise rates overall to pay for coverage of sick people that they can currently exclude from coverage.
• Excise taxes on ""Cadillac"" plans.
Insurance companies would pay an extra tax on the most generous health insurance plans people buy. The report said these taxes would be passed directly to consumers, and they projected that more plans would meet the definition of a ""Cadillac"" plan.
• Increased cost-shifting.
The report claims that Medicare pays health care providers below cost for treatment, so the providers have to charge people with private insurance more. If the legislation reduces payments for Medicare, that means people with private insurance will be charged more, according to the study.
• Taxes on medical devices.
The Senate Finance Committee bill raises taxes for the makers of certain medical devices, particularly the more expensive devices such as pacemakers and X-ray machines. The report says these taxes also would be passed on to consumers and result in higher premiums.
DeParle's criticism is that the report doesn't consider other parts of the bill that would lower costs for consumers. In particular, she points to health insurance exchanges, online marketplaces where people could comparison-shop for policies that meet their preferences for coverage and cost.
We read the report and found that DeParle is correct. The report does isolate aspects of the bill without considering the overall effects. It does not appear to consider how incentives or administrative efficiencies could result in reduced costs. The report even acknowledges that.
""The reform packages under consideration have other provisions that we have not included in this analysis,"" the report states.  ""We have not estimated the impact of the new subsidies on the net insurance cost to households. Also, if other provisions in health care reform are successful in lowering costs over the long term, those improvements would offset some of the impacts we have estimated.""
This caveat makes the report's findings incomplete, so we're skeptical that the specific dollar figures it presents as cost increases will reflect actual outcomes for consumers. However, it is reasonable to think that health insurance companies will pass on increased costs to consumers to the extent that they are able, which would drive up premiums. So the report isn't entirely off base, but it does present its evidence selectively.
The report did not derail Democrats' hopes for a successful vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The proposal was approved 14-9, with Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joining the Democrats. The next step is for the Senate Finance bill to be combined with a bill from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
Getting back to our ruling, DeParle criticized the health insurance industry report on the grounds that it was an incomplete analysis. She said it ""ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill."" The report itself admits as much.",1,Nancy-Ann DeParle
"In the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama ""voted 'present,' instead of yes or no"" on seven votes involving abortion rights. As the Democratic race has tightened, the Hillary Clinton campaign has portrayed Sen. Barack Obama as inconsistent on abortion rights.
""In the Illinois state Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted 'present,' instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women's right to choose,"" Sen. Clinton said in a December 2007 speech in Iowa. In the days leading up to Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, 2008, several other groups repeated the charge against Obama via e-mails.
The facts here are not in dispute. Obama did vote present on seven bills that attempted to restrict abortion. His defenders argue that it was a tactic to disrupt legislation that would be used against Democrats in swing districts.
It's worth pausing here to explain what the ""present"" vote means. The Illinois Legislature allows members to vote ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""present."" Bills need ""yes"" votes to pass, so a vote of ""present"" counts the same as a ""no."" Thus, Obama's ""present"" votes on bills seeking to restrict abortion counted the same as if he had voted ""no."" All of the bills passed by in the Senate by sizable margins.
The seven votes were on proposals that abortion opponents have successfully passed in other places. Two bills outlawed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Two bills required parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Three bills were for so-called ""born alive"" legislation, which require doctors to administer medical care to aborted fetuses that survive the abortion process in hopes that the fetuses can survive.
No one questions that Obama opposed the seven pieces of legislation; indeed, he is mentioned in news reports from the time as being against several of the measures. Rather, Obama's critics say he ducked a ""no"" vote; supporters say it was a tactical move.
Those interpretations seem to have split the leaders of the Illinois abortion rights movement.
Obama should have voted ""no"" on those bills, said Bonnie Grabenhofer, president of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Clinton.
""We think the way you talk about a bill and the way you stand up is important,"" she said. ""It was a strategy that allowed people to take political cover as opposed to talking about why the bill was a bad bill and clearly saying no.""
But Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Obama was helping advance a prochoice agenda by voting present.
""He always was going to vote 'no' on these bills. We needed to keep some of our moderate Democrats from voting yes, which is something you never want to happen,"" Sutherland said.   By having a well-known supporter of abortion rights also vote present, it gave other Democrats cover, she said.
Regardless of the interpretation of the ""present"" votes, Obama has received extremely positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights. Even Grabenhofer's organization, the NOW Illinois political action committee, endorsed Obama twice after the ""present"" votes. The group did not endorse in the U.S. Senate race in 2004, she said, in part because of the present votes.
Steve Trombley of Planned Parenthood in Chicago has defended Obama's prochoice bona fides, even though Planned Parenthood has not endorsed in the race.
""Barack Obama has always been committed to a woman's right to choose. He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record both in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois Senate,"" Trombley wrote in a statement posted on the Obama campaign Web site.
""I don't know why Illinois NOW has changed its opinion of Barack Obama since his record has remained the same and since his time as a state senator, he has only demonstrated a full and steady commitment to choice,"" Trombley added.
Both Clinton and Obama have their supporters among the abortion rights movement.
Clinton arguably has the bigger endorsements. She has been endorsed by the National Organization for Women and EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing prochoice women.
Obama has some high-profile endorsements as well, such as Kate Michelman, former president, NARAL Prochoice America, who sided with Obama after John Edwards dropped out of the race. Obama also has the support of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the first executive director of EMILY's List, who has publicly defended Obama as a strong supporter of abortion rights. We checked her statement here and found it to be True.
Two other large groups, NARAL Prochoice America and Planned Parenthood, are not endorsing. Planned Parenthood, however, has given both candidates 100 percent ratings for their records on abortion.
We stipulate that there are clearly different interpretations of the significance of Obama's ""present"" votes. But there's no doubt he made them.",1,Hillary Clinton
"The federal tax code has ""loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas."" President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over tax policy for many months. They have argued over the treatment of the middle class, small businesses and whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent. The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point -- the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas.
So far, this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign, although American-based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome. By one conservative estimate, this part of the tax code is worth $30 billion a year.
During the debate, Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas.
""When it comes to our tax code, Gov. Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.""
Romney responded, ""The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.""
In this fact-check, we'll examine the president’s statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations.
In the narrowest sense possible, Romney’s rebuttal is accurate. There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond U.S. borders. But if a plant moves at all, whether it’s from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia, it is eligible for deductions.
""There is certainly a tax break for U.S. companies that move operations or people abroad,"" said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. ""It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense.""
Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, went even further.
""A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions,"" Harvey said. ""In addition, the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a U.S. operation.""
But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations. There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS.
Tax break #1: Keeping profits overseas
When an American firm opens a foreign division, it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay U.S. taxes.
""That foreign subsidiary is a new entity, organized and created in a foreign country, ""said McGill. ""And responsible for its own taxes."" Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent company’s tax return.
The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where it's located. Those rates are often lower than in the U.S., where the corporate rate is 35 percent. So long as profits remain overseas, U.S. taxes are deferred.
The company can declare that none of that money will return to the U.S.
McGill, along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe, picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high-tech companies such as Google and IBM. With Apple, they found the company had built up $23.4 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently. And for good reason: Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 1.2 percent on those profits.
Tax break #2: Selling to yourself
An American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill. All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves. It’s perfectly legal and very lucrative. Take the example of Google.
In just one quarter, the owner of the world’s most popular search engine had nearly $2.8 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the U.S. That would put Google in good shape regardless, but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable. In 2009, the company’s foreign tax rate was 2.4 percent, reported Bloomberg News .
Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world. The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent. But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0.6 percent. The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda.
These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arm’s length. Harvey, the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner, said they are anything but.
""It is relatively clear most U.S. multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low-tax jurisdictions,"" Harvey said. ""I believe that anyone who believes the IRS can effectively enforce the arm’s-length standard is an eternal optimist — or delusional.""
Tallying the cost
Harvey said the tax tools that multinationals can use give them a competitive advantage over domestic firms. He points to the work of Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit news service. Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between $30 billion to $60 billion a year.
Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment.
""Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 1.9 million. Over the same period U.S. multinationals increased their employment overseas by 2.4 million,"" Sullivan said.
But the picture is more complicated than that might seem. There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts. Some analysts, including Harvey, believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe.
However, regardless of the initial motivation, once companies make the move, in Sullivan’s words, ""a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow.""",1,Barack Obama
"""Historically,"" Senate ratification of arms control treaties ""has been bipartisan."" As the House and Senate move into a brief lame-duck session before the new Congress begins work in January, one issue on the table is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms, as the Obama Administration wants.
The treaty would enact modest nuclear-weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year. Most Democrats and many foreign-policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty, which would require 67 votes in the Senate. But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans.
The Senate Republicans' leading spokesman on the issue, Minority Whip Jon Kyl of Arizona, said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue -- U.S. plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure. The administration took up the gauntlet, redoubling its efforts to ratify the treaty this year.
In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden wrote that ""national security interests are at stake"" in the ratification battle. But Republicans countered that the need for speed was overblown. In a separate item , we checked a statement by Kyl on NBC's Meet the Press in which he cited reports by the Washington Post and the Associated Press to justify his position that failure to ratify the new START treaty immediately would not threaten national security.
Now we'll take a look at an earlier comment by Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an interview on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Nov. 21, 2010, the host asked the nation's top military officer whether the Senate is ""playing politics with American national security.""
Mullen responded, ""Well, you'd have to ask the Senate about that.""
Amanpour pressed him, asking, ""What do you think?""
Mullen replied, ""Well, certainly, what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be ... recognized. Historically this has been bipartisan. This is a national security issue of great significance. And the sooner we get it done, the better.""
We wondered whether Mullen is correct that most prior arms-control treaties have been passed with bipartisan support.
We began by determining which treaties we should include in our assessment. We turned first to the list of ""treaties and agreements"" handled by the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance.
We only looked at formal treaties, which require a two-thirds vote by the Senate in order to be ratified. (A quick reminder: Treaties are negotiated and signed by representatives of the president, then ratified by the Senate. Once a few additional logistical steps are taken, treaty adherence is made official.) We also stuck to treaties that were primarily designed as arms control efforts, particularly when they dealt with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological and chemical.
By our count, the Senate has ratified 14 such treaties in 13 votes. Here's the list in chronological order, along with the year of U.S. ratification and the tally for and against in the Senate:
• Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1963 -- 80-19 .
• Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1969 -- 83-15 . (Seven Democrats and eight Republicans voted against.)
• Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, 1971 -- 70-0.
• Seabed Arms Control Treaty, 1972 -- 83-0 .
• Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, 1972 -- 88-2 . (U.S. later withdrew.)
• Biological Weapons Convention, 1974 -- 90-0 .
• Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, 1988 -- 93-5 .
• Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and Threshold Test Ban Treaty, 1990 -- 98-0 (to ratify both treaties).
• Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, 1991 -- 90-4 .
• Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as START I, 1992 -- 93-6 . (Expired 2009.)
• Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II, also known as START II, 1996 -- 87-4 .
• Chemical Weapons Convention, 1997 -- 74-26 (with 29 Republicans joining 45 Democrats in voting yes and 26 Republicans voting no.).
• Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty, 2003 -- 95-0 .
This list demonstrates that at least 13 treaties presented to the Senate for ratification passed by overwhelming majorities -- and with strong bipartisan support. The strongest opposition came in the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. But the opponents, led by the late Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., could not muster enough support either on amendments to the treaty or the treaty ratification vote itself to derail it. An additional historical footnote that bolsters the notion of bipartisanship: Thirteen of the 14 treaties above were ratified when one party held the presidency and the other party held the Senate.
There is, however, one example of a weapons treaty actually being voted down on the Senate floor. In 1999, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty fell, 51-48 , with all but four Republicans voting no. (Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., James Jeffords, R-Vt., Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., voted for the treaty, along with all Democrats except for Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who voted present.)
In remarks after the Senate vote, President Bill Clinton presaged what some Democrats have argued this month.
""In recent days, members of the Congressional majority have displayed a reckless partisanship,"" Clinton said. ""It threatens America's economic well-being and now our national security. Yesterday, hard-line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was partisan politics of the worst kind because it was so blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the American people and the world.""
So the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a clear exception to Mullen's claim. Whether there are additional examples is murkier.
We found two nuclear-related treaties from the Clinton era that were signed but never ratified by the U.S. -- the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. But in talking to experts, we found no evidence that either treaty was targeted for opposition based on partisan lines. In fact, according to a 1996 Chicago Tribune report, just days after the Clinton Administration signed the African treaty protocols, it clarified that the treaty would not prevent the U.S. from using nuclear weapons against Libya. So reservations about the African treaty don't appear to be based on partisanship.
In addition, the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT II, was signed by President Jimmy Carter but never ratified. While the negotiations over the treaty were somewhat contentious, the immediate reason for not pursuing ratification was the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, a rationale that had bipartisan support.
Another treaty that faced significant partisan opposition was the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which failed to advance to a vote in the Senate due to opposition by conservatives who expressed concern about its impact on U.S. sovereignty. But the subject of this treaty seems too far afield from what Mullen was talking about for us to count it.
So where does this leave us? We found one clear example of partisan opposition to a nuclear-weapons treaty -- the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty -- but 13 which were passed with broad, bipartisan support.",1,Mike Mullen
"""One man sacrificed for his country. One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth. One man stands up to the special interests."" In advance of the Potomac Primary on Feb. 12, 2008, Republican front-runner John McCain released a TV ad in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland that has played to other markets in this primary process.
""Never Surrender"" is a 30-second spot that shows images of Sen. McCain as a prisoner of war, walking alongside Ronald Reagan and on the campaign trail. Its claims are well supported.
•
""One man sacrificed for his country.""
McCain served 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including five as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down in Vietnam. He has been honored with the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Of his remaining Republican contenders, only Rep. Ron Paul has military experience. He served as a medical doctor in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 in San Antonio, Texas, and in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. He did not go to war as McCain did. That appears to be the distinction drawn here. ( Read our fact sheet on ""Who was in the military?"" here. )
•
""One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth.""
Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics.
As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there.
Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
""There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation,"" McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003.
""Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly.""
As for his claim that just ""one man"" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq.
But among his Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.
•
""One man stands up to the special interests.""
This is a reference to McCain's strong opposition to what he calls wasteful pork barrel spending and earmark projects. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that watches for such things, says McCain holds the title of pork-fighter and has honored him with its ""Treasury Guardians"" award.
Overall, it's an effective TV ad with accurate claims. We give it a True.",1,John McCain
"The Senate health care bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits. Republicans have a lot of concerns about the Senate health care bill, and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors.
On Day 2 of the chamber's health care debate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke about the issue on the Senate floor as he encouraged colleagues to send the bill back to committees for some major changes.
""Then we could start over and end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs, something the majority didn’t find any room for in their 2,074-page bill — not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals,"" McConnell said Dec. 1, 2009.
That claim has been echoed by other conservatives, including
Washington Post
columnist Charles Krauthammer.
Their argument for limiting malpractice cases or their awards — supporters call it ""tort reform"" — involves saving money. If doctors are not scared of being sued, they're less likely to order unnecessary tests and procedures for their patients, thus reducing medical costs.
Indeed, a Congressional Budget Office report from 2004 says health care premiums have risen recently in part ""because insurance companies have faced increased costs to pay for claims (from growth in malpractice awards)."" More recently, the independent budget office said that medical malpractice reform could save up to $54 billion over the next 10 years.
President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a June meeting of the American Medical Association, saying, ""I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. ... I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable.""
Nevertheless, Obama said malpractice awards should not be capped, as many Republicans want, because he believes the caps can be unfair to people who are wrongfully harmed.
Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, a physician, gave some insight into the issue when it came up in a Virginia town hall meeting last summer.
""Here's why tort reform is not in the bill: When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that the more stuff you put in it the more enemies you make,"" Dean said. ""The reason tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everyone else they were taking on, and that is the plain and simple truth.""
So, Democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the House or Senate version of the bills. Instead, the administration has said it will give some states $3 million grants to test new approaches for limiting lawsuits.
The two bills don't completely ignore the issue.
The Senate bill includes nonbinding ""sense of the Senate"" language on page 1,858 that ""states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety, reducing medical errors, encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes ... while preserving an individual's right to seek redress in court.""
The House bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits, but those proposals cannot include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages.
So, back to McConnell's claim. He said that the Senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation, and he is clearly correct.",1,Mitch McConnell
"""Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."" Policymakers and pundits are spending a lot of time these days talking about part-time jobs -- whether they are becoming more common at the expense of full-time jobs, and how problematic that is.
Republicans note that President Barack Obama’s health care law requires larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers, which they say gives companies an incentive to cut workers’ hours so much that they become part-time workers and thus exempt from the health insurance mandate.
And beyond the question of Obamacare’s incentives, some economists worry that since the most recent recession, companies have been unusually willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers.
We recently noticed two seemingly contradictory comments on this topic -- one from a Republican, one from a Democrat -- and thought it would be worthwhile checking both.
In this item, we will check a comment made by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, during an interview with Sara Eisen of Bloomberg television .
Eisen asked Krueger whether we’re ""creating a part-time economy. The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker's hours or putting a freeze on hiring.""
He responded, ""I think that's highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."" (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama’s health care law.)
In the other item, we checked a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that ""this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time.""
These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
For Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary:
So Krueger is right -- 87 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from full-time jobs.
Still, we will note that if you use a shorter time horizon, such as calendar year 2013, a large percentage of jobs created were part-time positions.
In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument.",1,Alan Krueger
"Medicare spends ""$15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies."" In the final presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News asked each candidate for specifics about programs they would cut in order to balance the federal budget.
""We spend $15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies,"" Sen. Barack Obama said. ""It doesn’t – under the Medicare plan – it doesn’t help seniors get any better. It’s not improving our health care system. It’s just a giveaway.""
Obama used the same example when asked a similar question in the first debate.
""We right now give $15-billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system,"" Obama said. ""Doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15-billion. That was a giveaway and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.""
Obama is talking about the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries who sign up. It was conceived as a cost containment measure on the theory that competition between HMOs, PPOs and other private plans would drive down costs. In fact, MA plans have consistently cost the government more per beneficiary than traditional fee-for-service Medicare costs. About 18 percent of beneficiaries now belong to MA plans.
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency, estimated that in 2008, the MA program cost 13 percent more than traditional Medicare. A Commonwealth Fund report estimates that that translates, on average, to nearly $1,000 more for each person in the MA program, for a national total of more than $8.5-billion last year (and a total $33-billion from 2004 to 2008).
Insurance companies argue that people enrolled MA programs get better service.
""One of the important things to keep in mind is that Medicare Advantage provides additional benefits and services not available in traditional fee-for-service programs,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans.
Zirkelbach argues that the plan offers better hearing, vision and dental coverage and a disease management plan. MA plans have also proven useful in some rural areas that are short on health care providers. Some plans refund all, or part, of their clients' Part B Medicare premium, which can save people hundreds of dollars a year.
The tradeoff is that beneficiaries are often limited to using hospitals and doctors in the plans' network. While beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are often less under MA plans, that is not always the case. Some services, like nursing home rehabilitation, can be more expensive than under traditional Medicare.
Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University and a former senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, said  that while MA participants may get about 13 percent more value from extra benefits in the MA plan, it costs about 13 percent more. So it isn't necessarily any more efficient than traditional Medicare, just more costly, Biles argues.
""Why should some people get an extra $1,000 in Medicare coverage and some not?"" Biles said.
In testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28, 2007, CBO director Peter R. Orszag said Medicare is, in effect, subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program.
But is it better? Orszag wasn’t convinced. ""Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management, care coordination, and preventive care programs, but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program,"" he said.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs, that the taxpayers would save $9.5-billion in 2009, $54-billion over the 2009-2012 period, and $150-billion over 10 years. It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his $15-billion figure.
Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced, ""half the plans will drop out in two years.""
That won’t sit well with people in those plans, he said, and it’s likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts – Republicans and Democrats alike – who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program.
Antos also takes issue with Obama’s characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies.
""In general, the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent,"" Anton said.
The programs tend to have a lower co-payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services.
""Does some of that stick to their (insurance company) fingers, of course,"" Antos said.
It's Obama's interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company ""subsidies"" or ""giveaways."" But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about $15-billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare, particularly as we move forward in coming years.",1,Barack Obama
"""Torture is illegal by our laws. It's illegal by international laws."" During the CBS-National Journal Republican presidential debate in Spartanburg, S.C. , on Nov. 12, 2011, one of the moderators, Major Garrett, invited Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, into a discussion of torture.
Both Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and former Godfather's Pizza executive Herman Cain had already said they favored allowing interrogators to use waterboarding -- the practice of simulating drowning to elicit information from a detainee. Waterboarding was permitted under the George W. Bush administration, but the policy was rescinded soon after President Barack Obama took office.
""Congressman Paul,"" Garrett said, ""my fighting sense tells me we have a debate about to get launched here. I know you have an opinion and would like to weigh in.""
Paul responded, ""Yes, torture is illegal by our laws. It's illegal by international laws.""
The exchange attracted significant attention following the debate. Obama was asked about it at a news conference in Hawaii. He responded that that Bachmann and Cain are among those who are ""wrong. Waterboarding is torture. It’s contrary to America’s traditions. It’s contrary to our ideals. That’s not who we are. That’s not how we operate. We don’t need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism. And we did the right thing by ending that practice.""
Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who ran against Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign, tweeted , ""Very disappointed by statements at SC GOP debate supporting waterboarding. Waterboarding is torture.""
We wondered whether Paul was right that torture is illegal under U.S. and international law. So we decided to check.
First, however, we should note that many -- though not all -- observers consider waterboarding to be a form of torture. We’ll address that issue more fully in a moment. For now, let‘s stick to Paul’s specific claim.
Is torture illegal under U.S. law?
Yes, under several different portions of the law.
• A provision of U.S. law (18 U.S.C. 2340) that took effect in 1994 makes torture a crime.
The law defines torture as ""an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control.""
• A different provision on war crimes addresses torture as well (18 U.S.C. 2441).
The provision reads, ""Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death. … As used in this section, the term ‘war crime’ (includes) … torture ...""
• Finally, as we noted here , two days after taking office, Obama issued a detailed executive order on torture and related issues.
The executive order said that prisoners ""shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person (including murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture), nor to outrages upon personal dignity (including humiliating and degrading treatment)."" It also specifically nullifies interpretations of federal law on interrogations ""issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009"" under President George W. Bush.
The executive order brings the CIA into line with U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation, said said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. This limits interrogators to humane techniques, a standard that already applies as a matter of law to the U.S. military, he said.
Is torture illegal under international law?
This is also a correct statement.
• The Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment of Punishment (the Torture Convention) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1984 and entered into force on June 26, 1987, after it had been ratified by 20 states. The United States ratified the convention on Oct. 21, 1994.
It defines torture as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.""
• The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This United Nations agreement -- approved on Dec. 16, 1966, and entered into force on March 23, 1976 -- says in part that ""no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" The United States ratified it in June 8, 1992.
• The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. This convention entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955. It bars ""at any time and in any place whatsoever"" all ""violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"" of ""persons taking no active part in … hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.""
• Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. This convention , This convention was entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955 and is virtually identical to the separate Geneva convention above.
• Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration , drafted by a committee that included former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, is not technically a treaty, but it does carry some weight in international law. It was ratified by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, by a vote of 48-0 with eight abstentions. The United States was one of the nations voting in favor of the declaration, which says that ""no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""
What constitutes torture?
So Paul is on solid ground when he says that ""torture is illegal … by our laws. It's illegal by international laws."" But as we indicated, there’s a significant caveat -- not everyone agrees on what constitutes torture.
""No one will dispute Rep. Paul’s statement,"" said Steven Groves, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ""What is in dispute is whether certain interrogation techniques are considered ‘torture’ under either the U.S. or international definition of that term.""
This is an especially important point given that Paul’s comment came in the context of a discussion of waterboarding. Many legal experts believe that waterboarding qualifies as torture under many if not all of the legal definitions cited above. But the Bush administration and its supporters strongly disagreed, calling waterboarding an ""enhanced interrogation technique"" and thus falling outside of the definition of torture.
An Aug. 1, 2002, memo by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and another memo dated the same day by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo sought to ""set a very high threshold as to what constitutes severe ‘pain or suffering,’"" said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.
These interpretations were overturned by Obama’s Jan. 22, 2009, executive order. But the controversy rages on -- as the Republican debate in South Carolina demonstrates.
We won’t seek to referee this question here, but we do think it’s important to note that some -- though by no means all -- observers would consider Paul’s comment to be a non-sequitur because of their position that waterboarding is not torture.",1,Ron Paul
"Says Romney flip-flopped on abortion. Fresh off a resounding primary win in Illinois, the Romney campaign used the momentum to make the case that the Republican primary contest was all but wrapped up and the former Massachusetts governor would inevitably be the nominee.
Then the Etch A Sketch remark happened.
On March 21, 2012, Mitt Romney’s senior communications director, Eric Fehrnstrom, gave an interview on CNN about the strategy for the general election. Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney’s opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven’t endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters.
""It's fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now,"" said political comedian John Fugelsang. ""Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?""
Fehrnstrom answered, ""Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.""
As expected, Romney’s opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children’s toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney’s firmness on issues.
Here we’ll check one such ad , put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century , which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion.
First, the toy
In case you skipped childhood, we’ll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch.
First manufactured in the 1950s, the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they’re turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece.
The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you’re done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas.
Now, the ad
The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom’s comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words ""Romney on the issues"" above it. Music that sounds like it’s coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background.
The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: ""I support a woman’s right to choose.""
Then the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears.
""I believe strongly in protecting life.""
The ad goes on to portray Romney’s apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan.)
For this fact-check, we’ll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate.
We found a Boston Globe story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender.
Following a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts’ state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him ""to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt's camp at the convention,"" according to the Globe.
Romney responded: ""The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he's pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman's right to choose doesn't follow very well.""
That’s the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge’s ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he’s made, however, express the same sentiment.
For one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" And, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
For another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""
The second Romney quote in American Bridge’s ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. ""I believe strongly in protecting life,"" the ad says.
We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge’s spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes ""were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present.""
It’s well-documented that Romney’s past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011, op-e d in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views:
""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.""
""I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life,"" he said in a debate that same month.
In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, ""I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed.""
Finally, we have examined Romney’s shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.)",1,American Bridge 21st Century
"Says Paul Ryan's budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about. Mitt Romney’s pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.
Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.
Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.
Ryan’s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")
Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.
The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!
For this check, we’re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.
""You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,"" Cutter said. ""You know what those cuts are? It’s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.""
It’s a lot to digest if you’re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them ""cuts"" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.
$700 billion in Medicare cuts?
Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?
Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget.
Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.
What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.
Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.
Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.
Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.
The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.
So it’s timing that’s making the ""cuts"" bigger, not changes to Medicare.
Does the Ryan budget ‘protect those cuts’?
Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.
Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney’s running mate:
Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.
Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" ( Read the full exchange .)
So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.
The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.
""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News . ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""
Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.
Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.
That’s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.",1,Stephanie Cutter
"The House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority. One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage.
An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan, won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday. His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage, requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances. (Read our detailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here .)
Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised, said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from California, on the MSNBC show
Morning Joe
.
Sanchez, who favors abortion rights, said that ""progressives are really angry"" because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one.
""On the other hand, we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice,"" Sanchez said. ""And I've told that to a lot of pro-choice groups. I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes. You need 218 to get to pass a bill.""
We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that ""the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice.""
We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress. It labeled 185 members ""prochoice.""
Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. It doesn't rate the entire Congress in the same way, but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member. A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life; a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all.
We crunched the numbers, looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life -- 185, the same as  NARAL's ""prochoice"" members.
Other numbers tend to support Sanchez's conclusion, but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesn't fall neatly into a yes-or-no category. NARAL labeled 203 members ""antichoice."" National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings.
NARAL labeled 47 members ""mixed choice,"" while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time.
So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isn't a ""prochoice majority"" in the House?
NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchez's comments. ""It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies,"" Miller said in an e-mail interview. ""While the numbers are challenging, we have managed to win some key votes this session (family-planning vote and lifting D.C. abortion ban) by gaining support from some mixed- and even antichoice members.""
National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson, on the other hand, downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House. His side does win some votes, he said, and the Stupak amendment was ""the clearest vote on abortion that we've had in the current Congress."" But he doubts that Congress would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision
Roe vs. Wade
, a major precedent establishing abortion rights.
""If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturn
Roe vs. Wade
, I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it,"" Johnson said.
In fact, a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life. We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupak's amendment but against it on other issues.
Indeed, the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area: The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion, but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money (as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies). Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion, and perhaps it will. But that's a business decision on the part of the insurers, not a government prohibition. We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill, once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform.
Getting back to Sanchez's statement: She said, ""the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice."" Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights. It's worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority, too. But as for Sanchez's claim, she is right.",1,Loretta Sanchez
"For ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office."" During a Nov. 30, 2011, speech in Scranton, Pa., President Barack Obama urged Congress to extend a payroll tax cut. He used the platform to try to change perceptions about his stance on taxes.
""Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that I’m this big tax-and-spend liberal,"" Obama said. ""Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since I’ve taken office, I’ve cut your taxes. … The average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average family’s tax burden is among the lowest it’s been in the last 60 years. So the problem is not that we’ve been raising taxes.  We’ve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times.""
A couple readers asked us to check this item. One wrote us, ""I've seen conservative reactions ranging from, ‘I laughed out loud’ to ‘What a comedian!’""
So we decided to take a look.
We’ve addressed two of these claims in previous items -- the one about small business tax cuts (rating it Mostly True ) and the one about the tax burden being the lowest in 60 years (rating it Mostly True ). So in this item, we’re only analyzing Obama’s claim that for ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office.""
First, let’s recap some background about the tax, and the tax cut, that Obama was touting in Scranton.
The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For two decades, the payroll tax meant a 6.2 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers. There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share.
In December 2010, the levy was cut to 4.2 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration. The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011.
But in his American Jobs Act , Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 3.1 percent for workers next year. (To help employers, the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first $5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses.)
Obama has also enacted some other tax cuts while in office, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and other educational fees and expansions of the existing Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit.
He’s also raised some taxes (or didn’t stop them from going up), but these hikes aren’t as relevant for judging his statement in Scranton. Some of the tax hikes haven’t taken effect yet, like a few in the health care bill, so these wouldn’t be a factor in judging the statement that for ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office."" Other tax increases affect only very wealthy taxpayers.
Two taxes would be relevant for this calculation. Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year.
It’s hard to tell exactly who’s footing the burden for these taxes. However, cigarette and tanning taxes account for a relatively small share of all federal taxes (and zero for people who don’t use either of them).
The broadest analyses we’ve seen are the tax analyses produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent research organization.
We looked at the group’s estimate of what tax burden is borne by Americans of different income levels. The group calculates the average federal tax burden and the average federal tax rate for five quintiles of U.S. households -- or 20-percent groupings, from the top of the income scale to the bottom. These figures include the federal income tax, payroll taxes, and estate taxes, though not federal excise taxes or corporate taxes. (The tax rate figure is the ""effective"" tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer ultimately pays as a percentage of their cash income. It’s not a ""tax bracket,"" which refers to the income tax rate paid on a taxpayer’s final dollar of income.)
To come up with a definition of ""middle class,"" we ignored the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent and focused on the three segments of 20 percent each in the middle of the income distribution. We used the tax data for 2008 and for 2011.

"""We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery."" Jeb Bush is making economic opportunity a major theme of his not-yet-official presidential campaign. One of his main gripes with the economy is that income isn’t going up.
""If we grew at a far faster rate, the middle would no longer be as squeezed as they are,"" Bush said. ""We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery.""
Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, made the remarks during a recent visit to Ohio, where he talked with Pittsburgh Tribune-Review political writer Salena Zito before addressing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting. (Zito paraphrased part of Bush’s quote in her article , but she provided us with the full text of Bush’s comment.)
We knew that the national employment picture has improved, slowly but surely, since the official end of the recession in mid 2009. But has the typical household income in the United States really fallen since the end of the recession? If true, that would be pretty startling.
As it turns out, median income has fallen, once you take inflation into account. Here are the details.
In September 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau published its annual roundup of data on income and poverty . Table A-2 in the report provides data on the inflation-adjusted, median household income for the most recent 10 years:
This shows that, despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013, real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by $2,120. That’s about 4 percent, or roughly 1 percent per year, every year.
The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013, and we don’t know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013. Still, we won’t mark down Bush for this, since he was using the most current data available.
""It's sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011.""
She added that the losses have not been experienced equally. Incomes, Sinclair noted, ""have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution,"" whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, and even more elite segments, have experienced gains.
Still, Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture, so we find no fault with his claim.",1,Jeb Bush
"Says ""Rick Santorum supported (Arlen) Specter over conservative candidates twice."" Mitt Romney’s campaign would like primary voters to remember that rival Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum once supported a ""liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat.""
A February 2012 attack ad focuses on Santorum’s relationship with former Sen. Arlen Specter,  the fellow Pennsylvanian he served with for 16 years in Congress.
The ad, titled, "" Arlen and Rick ,"" says:
Meet Arlen Specter: Liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat. The deciding vote on Obamacare. Rick Santorum supported Specter over conservative candidates — twice. (Santorum clip:) ""I'm proud to endorse Arlen Specter."" Santorum and Specter voted for liberal circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor. Santorum and Specter both sided with Big Labor, against right-to-work. If Rick Santorum couldn't say no to liberal Arlen Specter, can you really trust him to change Washington?
A description of the ad on the Romney campaign’s YouTube channel says, ""In 1996 and 2004, Rick Santorum supported Arlen Specter over conservative candidates.""
We decided we’d dig back 16 years to check: Did Santorum support Specter over conservative candidates twice?
We reached out to campaigns for Romney and Santorum, in addition to Specter, now adjunct faculty at University of Pennsylvania Law School. None responded by our deadline. But there was plenty written as history unfolded to help us judge this claim.
Santorum’s 1996 endorsement
The first flashback takes us to the mid '90s, when Sen. Arlen Specter, 65, hopped briefly into the Republican race for president.
Santorum, 37, was a freshly minted senator, elected in 1994 with a helping hand from Specter — who swallowed his opposition to the conservative, pro-life House member to ensure a Republican win over Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford.
""It wasn't like Arlen wanted Rick. He didn't. But when he won the primary, he rallied around him,"" said Terry Madonna, an expert in Pennsylvania politics with Franklin and Marshall College.
In 1995, as the junior senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum returned the favor, appearing on stage supporting his home-state colleague while Specter announced his candidacy for president.
(So, the ""1996"" endorsement was in 1995, but for Specter’s short-lived attempt to face Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential race.)
Did Santorum support Specter ""over conservative candidates""?
According to news coverage at the time, Specter said he was entering the race to challenge the party’s religious conservatives and speak in favor of abortion rights. He attacked conservative primary rivals during his speech — conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, leaders of the Christian Coalition —  with Santorum on stage.
The New York Times said , ""So pronounced was Mr. Specter's attack that he spoke this line twice: ‘Neither this nation nor this party can afford a Republican candidate so captive to the demands of the intolerant right that we end up re-electing a president of the incompetent left.’""
Santorum, for his part, didn’t play his supporting role flawlessly. The Times reporter noted that he ""rolled his eyes more than once and limited his applause.""
A few days later, Santorum was quoted by States News Service:
Santorum repeated his support of Sen. Arlen Specter's presidential candidacy, but it was hardly a ringing endorsement.
""The reason I endorse Sen. Specter is because I work with him everyday,"" Santorum said. He then added, ""and I think we agree on most things.""
Santorum’s 2004 endorsement
Santorum’s second endorsement of Specter was more recent — and has a more infamous — history.
A Washington Post blog recently called it "" Rick Santorum’s greatest sin .""
Conservative Pat Toomey challenged Specter in the GOP primary. Republican leadership, fearing Toomey would struggle in a general election, lined up behind centrist Specter, starting with President George W. Bush.
Santorum, who by 2004 ranked No. 3 in the Senate as the Republican Conference chairman — a job focused on keeping Republican seats — toed the line. With conservative backing, Specter just survived, keeping his Senate seat one more term.
However, Santorum opposed Specter in other ways, such as in Senate votes over social issues. In 2004, Specter’s voting record got just a 43 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union, the Bulletin News’ Frontrunner report noted. In 2010, Santorum’s lifetime ACU rating was 88 percent, according to National Review.
""On social stuff, he and Arlen were on very different planets,"" said Madonna, the Pennsylvania politics expert.
In fact, most coverage of Santorum’s endorsement of Specter noted how their politics differed.
For example, a 2004 Campaign & Elections article headlined, ""The Power of Endorsements,"" noted: ""Specter was helped by the endorsement of Santorum, his Senate colleague who is considerably more conservative. The men differed over abortion and stem cell research, among other issues. Santorum played down the differences in backing the incumbent and emphasized their agreement on judicial nominations and other issues. In a television commercial Santorum said, ‘I've heard people say they think Arlen Specter is a liberal. Well, let me tell you. . . Arlen is with us on the votes that matter.’""
During the six-year term won with help from Bush and Santorum, Specter switched his party allegiance and began to caucus with Democrats. Although the ad describes Specter as a  ""liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat,"" Santorum's endorsements of Specter all occurred when Specter was a Republican.
In 2010, Specter ran as a Democrat, and lost in the primary.",1,Mitt Romney
"Washing your hands and covering your mouth when you cough ""makes a huge difference"" in reducing transmission of the flu. President Barack Obama was asked about swine flu at a prime-time news conference marking his first 100 days in office. The reporter wanted to know if Obama would consider quarantines or closing the border with Mexico, where the flu appears to have started.
Obama said his health advisers were not recommending closing the border.
""But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain, we don't yet know how it will respond to that,"" Obama said.
""So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference,"" Obama said. ""If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane, don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus.""
We wondered about hand-washing and covering your mouth when you cough. Have our mothers been right all these years?
Indeed, Obama's remarks mirror the advice from the Centers for Disease Control almost perfectly.
When it comes to preventing the flu, the CDC recommends the following:
• Avoid close contact.
• Stay home when you are sick.
• Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
• Clean your hands.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
• Practice good health habits, like getting lots of sleep, getting exercise, and eating nutritious food.
We also found numerous independent scientific studies that found handwashing significantly reduced the transmission of disease, including the MRSA bacteria and the flu.
The University of Michigan School of Public Health is in the midst of a two-year study examining whether face masks and handwashing can reduce the transmission of the flu. The study tracked the spread of flu among college students in university dorms, and used a control group to compare outcomes.
Initial results indicate that face masks and hand sanitizing reduced the transmission rate of the flu by as much as 50 percent.
But knowing you should wash your hands and doing it are two different things. And putting your hands under the faucet for three seconds and then wiping them on your slacks doesn't count.
Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of
Consumer Reports
magazine, has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of handwashing in hospitals. Studies show that doctors and health care workers wash their hands only about half the time they should before examining patients, said Lisa McGiffert, the director of the group's ""Stop Hospital Infections"" campaign.
""Some people think that this is such a simple thing that it couldn't make a difference. But it does,"" McGiffert said. ""This is what the experts have been trying to get health care workers and doctors to do for decades, and it does make it difference.""
Hand sanitizers are a good substitute for handwashing, and coughing into your arm is better than coughing into your hand, she said. To make sure you've washed your hands thoroughly, sing
Happy Birthday
(silently, please). When the song is over, you've washed long enough. And regular soap works just fine.
Obama said that handwashing and covering your mouth when you cough can make a huge difference. The scientific consensus on handwashing backs him up.",1,Barack Obama
"AIG ""said they were giving $57 million (in retention payments) to people who were being terminated."" Often lost in the raging debate over $165 million in bonuses paid to AIG employees — amid a $170 billion taxpayer-funded bailout — is the fact that these were not performance bonuses, they were ""retention awards."" Essentially, they were payments made to employees to keep them from leaving the crumbling company.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., has been railing against the retention bonuses for months, but this week he came across a line in a recent AIG filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that really galled him.
""Keep in mind, in their filings — AIG's recent filings — they said they were giving $57 million to people who were being terminated,"" Cummings said in an interview on ABC's
Good Morning America
on March 16. ""I mean, that goes in the opposite direction of retention. And I really do think the American people are being played for fools by AIG.""
Sure enough, if you go to page 222 of AIG's 10-K filing last month, you'll find this line: ""Restructuring expenses include $44 million of retention awards and Total amount expected to be incurred includes $57 million for retention awards for employees expected to be terminated.""
What? Retention bonuses to people you don't plan to...you know...retain?
""As part of restructuring the company, we will ultimately eliminate jobs that are, at the moment, critical to maintaining ongoing operations and winding down certain businesses,"" Christina Pretto, an AIG spokeswoman, told Bloomberg. ""To have one of these positions obviously implies an uncertain future, and creates an incentive to leave the company. To retain such mission-critical people, we are making retention payments to them.""
In all, AIG committed to $1 billion worth of retention payments. In a Dec. 5, 2008, letter to  Rep. Cummings, AIG chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said retaining key employees is critical for the company to maintain its standing in the eyes of reinsurers and rating agencies, and ultimately is essential for AIG to recoup as much as it can for taxpayers. ""We would be doing a disservice to the taxpayer — and would place AIG's asset divestiture plan at risk — if we did not act decisively to ensure that our key employees remain with the company,"" said Liddy, who took over the reins at AIG in September at the government's request.
With the company posting monstrous losses, we should note that these retention payments will essentially be paid through the infusion of cash from the taxpayer-funded bailouts.
At the moment, the retention payments that have drawn the most scorn are those to employees in the financial products division, the folks that got the insurance conglomerate into the deep mess it's currently in. Those agreements predate the company bailouts by the federal government. Back in April 2008 and ""due to the declining market environment,"" the company established an employee retention plan with financial products employees ""to manage and unwind its complex business,"" according to SEC filings. An installment payment on those retention bonuses came due on March 15 to the tune of $165 million. That's the payment that triggered the recent political storm.
According to a letter sent by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to House Financial Services Charman Barney Frank on March 17, 73 employees got retention bonuses of $1 million or more; and 11 of them are no longer working at AIG (including one who got $4.6 million). In all, the New York attorney general's office found that 52 of the 418 employees who got the retention bonuses have left the company.
Liddy said the retention bonuses amounted to going to those employees and saying, ""You have a job. That job's going to go away after you wind down the book of business that you manage. If you'll stay...""
In a congressional hearing on March 18, Frank asked if those who got retention bonuses and then left had to give back their bonus. ""No,"" Liddy said. ""The arrangement is, if you stay, wind down your particular business, do a good job of it, and we're comfortable with the job you've done, you'll get that retention bonus.""
""I'm trying desperately to prevent an uncontrolled collapse of that business,"" Liddy said. ""This is the only way to improve AIG's ability to pay taxpayers back quickly and completely and the only way to avoid a systemic shock to the economy that the U.S. government help was meant to relieve. Make no mistake. Had I been CEO at the time, I would never have approved the retention contracts that were put in place over a year ago. It was distasteful to have to make these payments, but we concluded that the risk to the company and, therefore, the financial system in the economy, were unacceptably high. And if not paid, we ran the risk that we would have happen what everyone has worked so hard thus far not to have happen.""
Liddy said he has since asked employees of AIG Financial Products ""to step up and do the right thing. Specifically, I've asked those who received retention payments in excess of $100,000 or more to return at least half of those payments."" Some have already stepped forward, he said, and offered to give up a hundred percent of their payments.
Meanwhile, legislators have been scrambling to find ways to wiggle out of the retention contracts, with some threatening to pass legislation such that if the bonuses aren't returned, they will be taxed to nothing.
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Liddy vowed to do everything he could to reduce 2009 retention payments by at least 30 percent.
But he also warned that messing with commitments to employees could lead to a mass exodus that could threaten the company's ability to make taxpayers whole. ""On the one hand, all of us at AIG recognize the environment in which we operate and the remonstrations of our president for a more restrained system of compensation for executives,"" Liddy said. ""On the other hand, we cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses — which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers — if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.""
Cummings isn't buying that.
In a statement provided to PolitiFact, Cummings said that while he ""understands where AIG is coming from in this argument, when I look at the bigger picture here, I just do not see this as being a reasonable argument for several reasons. First, it is simply unnecessary to give a $4 million bonus to someone who is already making $1 million a year — we are talking about quadrupling an annual salary — to keep someone at a company when the job market is as weak as it is. In these times, a weekly paycheck is all the retention payment anybody needs. Second, AIG is losing employees anyway, despite offering these retention payments. And, if you think about it, this makes sense. What employee is going to stay with a company when the company announces that it is liquidating its assets? This company has suffered the greatest quarterly loss in the history of corporate record-keeping in this country. Third, I just do not believe that the company is implementing the retention program in the most efficient and effective manner. I could possibly understand giving retention payments to a handful of top employees to keep them — but thousands of employees? I just cannot fathom how there can be thousands of indispensable employees right now, when there are hundreds of thousands of people in the financial sector who have lost their jobs.""
David Schmidt, a consultant at executive pay firm James F. Reda & Associates, said retention award programs are fairly common for companies that are in trouble. ""That doesn't mean you can't be annoyed by it,"" he said. But the bottom line, he said, is that if the government figures out a way not to pay the bonuses, it likely means ""a lot of these folks are just going to leave."" The reality, Schmidt said, is that many of these employees are in high demand.
This is a complex issue, and much of the detail about the retention bonuses has not yet been publicly revealed. And it's certainly debatable whether the company needs to be paying such large retention bonuses to so many employees. But the fact we are checking here is whether AIG plans to spend $57 million on retention awards for people it expects to terminate in the future. And the answer, according to the company's recent SEC filings, is yes. We rule the statement True.",1,Elijah Cummings
"Says President Obama ""has fired more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined."" The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in 2009, the first year of his presidency, has long rankled his opponents, who felt he was inexperienced and hadn't earned the prestigious award.
And even many of Obama’s supporters were disappointed by his decisions to continue the U.S. role in Iraq and send more troops to Afghanistan.
So when Obama in March 2011 decided to enforce a ""no-fly zone"" to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from crushing rebel forces, criticism flared.
One of the most cutting lines, which ricocheted around blogs and even appeared on bumper stickers from a Libertarian website, stated: ""Obama’s fired more cruise missiles than all other Nobel peace prize winners combined.""
A version of that slogan was put on a sign (with ""missles"" misspelled) along Route 12 near Keene, N.H., by Mark Edgington, a libertarian talk-radio host whose program, Free Talk Live, is heard on about 100 stations around the country.
Edgington said he believes the sign is true because of what he's read on the Internet -- plus the fact that cruise missiles were not so available when other wartime leaders won Nobel peace prizes.
""They didn’t have cruise missiles around then, so I felt relatively confident that it was true,"" said Edgington, who said his concern was also directly tied to Obama’s decision to intervene in Libya without seeking congressional authorization.
""I find the actions to be unconstitutional. And I still think there is a greater message: he’s an awfully big killer to have received the Peace Prize, and I would have said the same thing about (former President George W.) Bush,"" he told PolitiFact.
But is Barack Obama really a warmonger? And does the Dalai Lama (winner, 1989) know about this?
First, a crash course in cruise missiles. They include everything from the short-range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles.
The Federation of American Scientists, an independent Washington-based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology, defines cruise missiles as ""an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target.""
More simply put, cruise missiles, often fired from sea or air, are jet-propelled, as opposed to rocket-propelled missiles. Rather than the arc of a rocket, they fly more like a plane to avoid radar.
At least 12 exporting countries -- Great Britain, the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Taiwan -- have developed them, according to the FAS website, and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals.
They aren’t cheap, either -- Tomahawks now cost about $1.1 million apiece, the Navy said recently.
Cruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V-1, or ""buzz bomb,"" of World War II. And some countries have had short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles for years.
John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based website of military information, said the U.S. relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons.
Pike said current-day cruise missiles’ major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush. That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired.
An elite group
Given the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used, the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited.
For starters, Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (1997), Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi (1991) and Doctors Without Borders (1999) aren’t going to be firing cruise missiles -- ever.
Similarly, while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign, they can’t be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans.
And former President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002, was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office, outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran.
Mikhail Gorbachev (Nobel, 1990) was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal, but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan. Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are ""necessarily incomplete,"" but says he ""cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used"" there.
And while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years, some reportedly for nuclear purposes, they have held them largely in check.
Accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short-range Soviet-made anti-ship cruise missiles against the Israelis, which would implicate then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (who won the Nobel along with Israel’s Menachem Begin in 1978). And the Israelis reportedly fired anti-ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets, sinking 10 of their boats.
But even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles, future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994, were not in power at the time, nor was Begin. And the numbers fall short of U.S. salvos.
The Obama Tally
So is Obama a cruise-missile-firing standout among Nobel laureates?
He has fired at least 192, according to the Pentagon’s March 28 briefing about Libya, and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them. But he's the only president in that group to win the peace prize.
Vice President Al Gore, who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming, supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo. And, in fact, as president, Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly, sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq, Serbia, Sudan and Afghanistan. But, Clinton was commander in chief, not Gore.
It’s also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner, former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. But he and Richard Nixon used bombers, not nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, for that campaign.
Experts said they believe the sign's claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true, but also merits some context.
George R. Lucas Jr., the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the U.S. Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, said by e-mail that the statement was probably ""true by definition"" and undoubtedly ""deliberately ironic"" to score a point.
""My own sense is that this president (has) behaved very responsibly with the use of military force, but that, like all recent presidents, he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex, and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism,"" Lucas wrote.
For his part, Obama, in a March 28, 2011, speech, defended the Libyan strikes, saying they were for a humanitarian purpose, intended to save the city of Benghazi ""and the people within.""
Based on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians, it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct. The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war, but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama, even in combination with other laureates. If we hear of additional evidence, we'll revisit this item. But in the meantime, the numbers indicate the sign is correct.",1,Yard sign
"""If you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."" In back-to-back appearances on Meet the Press, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre went another round in their duel over proposed gun legislation.
Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases. LaPierre opposes expanded background checks. Both are working hard to discredit the other.
During Bloomberg’s segment, he told host David Gregory that once upon a time, LaPierre was in favor of the background checks he’s now fighting.
""In fact, if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done,"" Bloomberg said.
We’re fact-checking statements by both Bloomberg and LaPierre from Meet the Press. Here, we’ll examine the New York mayor’s characterization of what LaPierre said back in 1999.
‘We think it’s reasonable’
On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier.
To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy.
First on that list:
""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said . ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.""
He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free.
Other evidence
New York  magazine , in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.""
We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloomberg’s claim.
In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN , ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work.""
LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.
""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?""
LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law.""
The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks:
""The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.""",1,Michael Bloomberg
"McCain ""said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV."" With Sen. John McCain aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton, some of the most fervent of which are especially concerned with women's issues, the advocacy group Planned Parenthood has been spreading the word about why it believes women should oppose McCain.
To that end, the group employed one of the more attention-getting novelty items of the campaign thus far on Aug. 25, 2008, handing out condoms at a party near the Democratic National Convention in Denver, each bright-pink package bearing the message ""Protect Yourself from John McCain"" and one of 10 reasons the group believes voters — especially women — shouldn't vote for him. The group said it plans to distribute 30,000 of the condoms at the convention.
The 10 reasons were various claims about McCain's stances on women's issues, such as the well-known fact that he opposes
Roe vs. Wade
, and the opinion that he opposes certain ""commonsense"" funding for contraception and education.
We decided to look at Reason 9: McCain ""Said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV.""
The claim is rooted in a comment — arguably a gaffe — that came during one of the freewheeling conversations with reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express that McCain commonly held earlier in the campaign. Here's a transcript of part of the conversation, which took place in Iowa on March 16, 2007.
And here's the crucial exchange:
Planned Parenthood condoms carrying statement about candidate John McCain.
Q: ""What about grants for sex education in the United States? Should they include instructions about using contraceptives? Or should it be Bush's policy, which is just abstinence?""
McCain: (Long pause) ""Ahhh. I think I support the president's policy.""
Q: ""So no contraception, no counseling on contraception. Just abstinence. Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV?""
McCain: (Long pause) ""You've stumped me.""
Q: ""I mean, I think you'd probably agree it probably does help stop it?""
McCain: (Laughs) ""Are we on the Straight Talk Express? I'm not informed enough on it. Let me find out. You know, I'm sure I've taken a position on it on the past. I have to find out what my position was. Brian, would you find out what my position is on contraception — I'm sure I'm opposed to government spending on it, I'm sure I support the president's policies on it.""
Q: ""But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Would you say: 'No, we're not going to distribute them,' knowing that?""
McCain: (Twelve-second pause) ""Get me Coburn's thing, ask Weaver to get me Coburn's paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days. I've never gotten into these issues before.""
So yes, McCain said he was ""stumped"" when asked whether he thinks contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV. This is one truth-telling condom.",1,Planned Parenthood
"Says Mitt Romney said he does not ""line up with the NRA."" Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is running a television ad that uses rival Mitt Romney’s own words against him.
The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney’s quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, ""I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association.""
The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It’s startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad’s claim.
Did Romney really say that?
In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994.
Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions.
According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed.
""I don't line up with the NRA,"" Romney said, according to the story.
The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum’s ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position.
At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill.
His words since
In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk.
In a debate comment captured in this Y ouTube video , Romney said, ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won’t chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety.""
In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law ""ineffective and unnecessary.""
By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney’s tone had begun to change.
The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric:
""He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows.
""Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws.""
The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy.
At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as ""The Right to Bear Arms Day"" in Massachusetts to honor ""the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense.""
The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain.
Romney said, ""My position on guns is the same position I’ve had for a long, long time. That position is that I don’t line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don’t see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue.""
He said he still supported banning weapons that are ""unusually lethal"" but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights.
""We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t,"" he told Russert.
The 2012 campaign
Romney didn’t attend the NRA’s national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message . He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government.
""I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise,"" he said.
Romney’s campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free.
""As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment,"" the website says.
We contacted the NRA for this story but didn’t hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn’t unusual. It didn’t announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama.
Christopher Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that ""any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy.""",1,Rick Santorum
"As a candidate, President Obama ""declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president."" To build opposition to the health care bill, Republicans have been saying it would expand coverage of abortion. To back up that claim, House Republican Leader John Boehner sent a ""GOP Leader Alert"" that said President Barack Obama was doing that to fulfill a campaign promise.
""During his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president,"" Boehner wrote in the Sept. 10, 2009, message.
There's never been any question that Obama favors abortion rights. On Jan. 22, 2008, for instance, Obama released a statement on the 35th anniversary of the
Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion that said, ""Throughout my career, I've been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice, and have consistently had a 100 percent prochoice rating with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America."" But he has been somewhat more coy, or perhaps strategically fuzzy, about exactly where he would draw the line on federal funding for abortion in his own health care plan. His comments on abortion rights have often used the phrase ""reproductive care"" rather than abortion.
We'll take a separate look at the three parts of Boehner's sentence. Did candidate Obama say that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care? Did he say that such issues are at the heart of his health care reform plan? And did his definition of ""reproductive health"" care include abortion?
On the first and second questions, we think then-candidate Obama did say something that closely matches what Boehner says he did.
In a July 17, 2007, appearance before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Obama said the following: ""In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care."" (This one is not included in our Obameter database of promises, but we'll examine next week whether it should be.)
The words Obama used are slightly different from the ones cited by Boehner, but we think that to say reproductive care is ""essential"" means that ""everyone deserves"" to have it. Meanwhile, inferring from Obama's language that it's a ""right"" requires a slight leap, but it's close enough that we won't quibble.
So the key to whether Boehner is right comes with the third question: Does Obama's definition of ""reproductive health care"" necessarily include abortion? On this question, the evidence is suggestive but not quite a slam dunk.
Abortion opponents rely on a few pieces of evidence to support the assertion that Obama believes reproductive health care includes abortion. One is a story that ran in the
Chicago Tribune
on July 18, 2007, the day after Obama's Planned Parenthood speech. In it, Washington bureau reporter Mike Dorning wrote that when Obama was asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance, the candidate ""said it would cover 'reproductive health services.' Contacted afterward, an Obama spokesman said that included abortions.""
Another source is a candidate questionnaire by RH Reality Check, which describes itself as ""an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights."" Posted Dec. 21, 2007, the questionnaire was filled out by ""Sen. Barack Obama's campaign staff.""
The question that's most relevant to Boehner's assertion is this one:
Q: Does Sen. Obama support the Hyde amendment (which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortions)? Under what circumstances does he believe that Medicaid should cover abortions (all pregnancies, life- or health-threatening pregnancies, pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, extreme fetal malformation)?
A: Obama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman's decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors.
Both of these comments suggest, fairly strongly, that Obama would include access to abortion in his health care plan — but they leave a degree of doubt. While we are not aware of any pushback from the campaign once these two items were published, both statements were made by campaign staffers, not the candidate himself.
On his campaign Web site, Obama did not specifically address the federal funding issue. In the ""women's issues"" section, the campaign said only that ""Barack Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue, and respects those who disagree with him. However, he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving women's rights under
Roe vs. Wade
a priority as president. He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in that case.""
Asked for any additional evidence to back up Boehner's assertion that Obama was referring specifically to abortion, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, told PolitiFact that Obama was speaking in ""terms of art"" that his Planned Parenthood audience would immediately grasp.
""'Reproductive health services' is one of those conventions that all of the players understand. It is not limited to abortion, but it always encompasses abortion. It is like when a prolife candidate says, 'I support strong legal protection for the right to life of unborn children.' Everyone on all sides understands that this means he thinks abortion generally should not be legal, and no doubt he also supports fetal homicide laws . . . I suppose someone could argue that since he didn't specifically mention abortion, there is the theoretical possibility that he wants to keep abortion completely unrestricted and only wants to pass fetal homicide laws. But that would be to ignore the lexicon that groups develop on these issues and the way they are understood in context.""
So back to Boehner's claim. He said that candidate Obama ""declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president."" The record shows that Obama did indeed make those statements. His message to the abortion rights group may have been deliberately fuzzy, but it's clear what he meant — and it was confirmed by the campaign to the
Tribune

"""There's not one Democrat who endorses"" the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. In their only face-to-face debate of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin challenged and chided each other’s proposals, particularly on the hot-button issue of Medicare reform.
Ryan is the author of a House budget proposal that calls for substantial changes to the government health care program for seniors, including an eventual shift to ""premium support"" which beneficiaries could use to purchase private insurance. Romney has embraced it as a means of introducing choice and competition into Medicare. Democrats, including Biden and President Barack Obama, say it will end up costing seniors more.
In the Oct. 11 debate , Ryan defended the plan as having bipartisan support:
""This is a plan that's bipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat
senator from Oregon,"" said Ryan.
""There's not one Democrat who endorses it,"" Biden interjected.
""Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon,"" Ryan answered amid some cross-talk.
""And he said he does no longer support (it),"" Biden insisted.
Medicare -- complex, polarizing and highly political because of the huge voting bloc of seniors who cherish it -- is center stage in the campaign. We decided to check who’s right about across-aisle-support for the Republican plan.
The Ryan budgets
Ryan, the Republican House budget chairman, first unveiled a budget blueprint in early 2011 that would convert Medicare to the premium support model. It also raised the program’s eligibility age from 65 to 67, called for a repeal of Obamacare and reined in other spending to reduce the federal deficit. It passed the House on April 15, 2011, but the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected it a month later.
Arguments over Medicare hit a fever pitch that year, with Democrats accusing Republicans of voting to "" end Medicare ."" Then, in December, the hope of compromise peeked through the partisan clouds.
Ryan and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joined together and offered a compromise on Medicare reform ideas. Their ideas were contained in a white paper -- never taking the form of legislation -- and were branded as marrying the best proposals from each side.
The main difference from Ryan’s original plan: The new proposal left in place traditional Medicare for those who wanted it, while still offering premium support to buy private policies.
""There's a lot to work with here in terms of trying to find common ground,"" Wyden said at the time, according to the Washington Post. ""This doesn't end Medicare as we know it. People can go to bed knowing that traditional Medicare will be there for them for all time.""
He said the plan presented ""the opportunity for progressives and conservatives to come together and address the real challenges"" of the federal entitlement program: rising health costs and an aging population.
Democrats were unequivocal in their criticism. The White House returned to the old party line, saying the plan would ""end Medicare as we know it."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats said it would essentially kill Medicare. Republicans, who sensed a political opportunity in the defection of Wyden, offered more open-minded reactions. Newt Gingrich, who called Ryan's original plan ""right-wing social engineering,"" praised the Ryan-Wyden deal as ""a major breakthrough.""
Wyden, a senator since 1996, is known as policy-driven and liberal-minded, but also a true and rare compromiser. He told the Oregonian newspaper in March 2012 that he was not being punished by Democratic leaders for partnering with Ryan, saying his biggest adversaries were special interests.
""When you deal with a big issue where there are a lot of passions, you expect this,"" he said then. ""I made the judgment that I couldn't just sit by and talk about business as usual for this program that, for me, has been sacred for three decades.""
He also found himself fending off suggestions by Romney that he abetted the Republicans’ Medicare plan. Wyden, according to the Oregonian, said he'd never spoken to Romney. He posted an explanation in the Huffington Post titled "" Preserving the Medicare Guarantee: Why I've Been Working with Paul Ryan .""
He used personal anecdotes to explain his motivation to fight for seniors and warned that serious reform was needed to preserve the ""guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.""
In the meantime, Ryan unveiled his budget proposal for 2013 . It contained many of the same hallmarks as its predecessor: reduced federal spending, repeal of Obamacare. Only this one incorporated the Ryan-Wyden plan for Medicare, with premium support and the traditional option.
Wyden said he was wary of the wider proposal, citing a lower limit for Medicare's spending growth and a full repeal of the health care overhaul. He also warned his Medicare white paper should not be used to anoint the whole Ryan budget as having bipartisan support.
""Any person on the right who says that this is about cover -- that person is hurting senior citizens,"" Wyden said in a March 20 story in Congressional Quarterly Today. ""I say that explicitly because they're making it tougher to get a bipartisan agreement in the future.""
Partners no more
If the spring of 2012 showed the Ryan-Wyden romance fading, late summer was the break-up. On Aug. 11, 2012, Ryan was tapped as Romney’s running mate, and within days, Romney was hailing his VP nominee’s Medicare plan as bipartisan -- and naming Wyden.
""Paul Ryan and Sen. Wyden said, 'No, we need to restore, retain and protect Medicare,' "" Romney said at a campaign stop in Virginia. ""That's what our party will do.""
The Post wrote that Wyden was ""apparently displeased about his sudden prominence as a validator of the Republican ticket.""
""Gov. Romney is talking nonsense,"" Wyden told reporters, according to the Post.
He explained in detail his two main objections to Romney’s proposals in an interview with Ezra Klein , who writes the Post’s Wonk Blog. Repealing Obamacare, he said, would undo changes to Medicare that are necessary to transition to premium support.
Secondly, Romney has proposed turning Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and disabled, into a block grant to the states and rein in spending. That change, Wyden said, ""would do enormous harm to those people whose protection was at the center of the white paper."" Romney’s approach to Medicaid ""completely pulls the rug out from under the poorest and most vulnerable seniors,"" he said.
If any doubt remained following the vice presidential debate on Oct. 11 about Wyden’s position on the Republican Medicare plan, Wyden addressed it the same night on his Facebook page .
""The Republican ticket knows that neither I, nor any other Democrat, would support these policies. The Romney/Ryan plan on Medicare is further proof that Mitt Romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to Washington,"" he wrote.",1,Joe Biden
"The United States spends ""almost three times per capita what they spend in the U.K."" on health care and ""50 percent more than they pay in France."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says the best solution to address problems in the United States’ health care system is to guarantee every American access to health care as a right.
Speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate, Sanders continued to express support for a single-payer health care system that is popular throughout much of the rest of the world.
To make his point, Sanders compared health care costs between the United States and two other Western nations -- the United Kingdom and France.
""Why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K. --  50 percent more than what they pay in France?"" Sanders asked. ""The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. We need to pass a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.""
Sanders’ numbers are arresting and largely correct.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has the data for all three nations. The following table has breakdown.
Do the math, and total U.S. spending is about 2.7 times what they spend in the United Kingdom per person, and a bit over twice what they spend per person in France. Everything is measured in dollars, and the data are from 2013.
It’s interesting to note the role that public spending makes in each country. In the United States, public and private spending are nearly the same. In the United Kingdom and France, private spending is a much smaller slice of the total.
Sanders’ claim in this case is more accurate than more sweeping versions he has made in the past. In 2009 and again in 2015 , he claimed that the United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as any other country. Those claims are overly broad.",1,Bernie Sanders
"""When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the [peanut] recall."" Is our food-safety system really that weak?
We realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections.
But Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, alleged it also exposed the federal Food and Drug Administration as toothless when it comes to recalls.
""When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall,"" the congresswoman said at a Feb. 4, 2009, news conference.
DeLauro was speaking amid great public concern about the outbreak, which was discovered in January 2009 after it killed eight people and sickened more than 500 in 43 states. It was traced to tainted peanut butter and paste from a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Georgia and possibly another in Texas.
Those ingredients had been distributed nationwide in all sorts of products, prompting recalls of more than 2,100 products from energy bars to ice cream.
DeLauro's comment evoked an image of FDA officials meekly asking company executives if it was okay to protect the public from tainted peanuts. We wondered whether she was stretching the truth to drum up support for a bill she proposed to strengthen the FDA's recall process.
A spokeswoman said DeLauro was referring to the voluntary nature of food recalls. And indeed, the FDA recall process is almost entirely voluntary — strictly speaking.
This is poorly understood by consumers, the media and even some food companies, the FDA says in this primer on its recall policies.
""The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not generally authorize FDA to 'order' a manufacturer to recall a food, cosmetic or supplement,"" the online brochure says. Only when it comes to medical devices, human-tissue products and infant formula can the agency order a recall.
DeLauro's office said she got her information partly from this New York Times article , which reported that the government ""needed the company’s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products.""
There's an important bit of context to add, though.
In reality, companies do not generally refuse FDA requests to issue a recall. In fact, none has ever done so, at least in the memory of Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
""I don't think there's ever been a case to my knowledge where a company has refused to recall products when we told them in very specific terms that we would be taking additional actions,"" Sundlof told a Senate committee in a Feb. 5, 2009, hearing on the salmonella outbreak.
Additional actions the FDA can take against any company that refuses to recall food can include seizing products and enjoining the company from doing further business.
Bill Marler, a personal injury lawyer who specializes in foodborne illnesses, concurred with Sundlof. He said companies have little motivation to refuse the agency's recall requests, or even delay the process, because doing so would expose them to more legal liability.
""In my experience, there is very seldom a delay, because most of the time you've got a company who wants to solve the problem and not poison any more of its customers than it already has,"" said Marler, who is based in Seattle.
Plenty of food-safety advocates argue the FDA should have the authority to mandate recalls. But their main concern is not that companies refuse to issue recalls voluntarily, it's issues such as FDA's limited control over how aggressively to recover products, and that ""voluntary recalls"" might not sound serious enough to consumers.
DeLauro arguably made our food-safety regime sound weaker than it is, since there is little question as a practical matter that companies will quickly agree to recalls. And it was imprecise for her to say the FDA waited for the company's approval to ""go live"" with the recall — the FDA did not ""go live"" with the recall at all; it was the company that issued it.
But ""go live"" is a vague term, and DeLauro seems to have meant ""announce."" And it's true that the FDA could not post on its Web site this press release announcing the recall, which came from the Peanut Corporation of America, until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release.
So while DeLauro's depiction of the recall process was not full and complete, it was technically accurate.",1,Rosa DeLauro
"Says Obama has flip-flopped on public campaign financing. ""If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election."" Barack Obama, fall 2007
""We've made the decision not to participate in the public-financing system for the general election."" Barack Obama, June 19, 2008
Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped.
""The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people,"" said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. ""Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics.""
The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad. We explore the group's other claims in the ad in this story. Here, we'll examine the allegation about public financing.
When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election.
To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy.
On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the contributions separate.
The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. ""Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same,"" Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the New York Times.
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: ""If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing.""
""Yes,"" Obama said in his response. ""In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system.
McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system.
But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling.
Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. ""What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.""
In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals.
As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides were expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but if those contributions were lopsided, a candidate who had accepted public financing could be at a disadvantage because of the spending limits.
So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the private system.
""It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,"" Obama said in a video to supporters. ""But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.""
He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by ""Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations.""
Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to a news account that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system.
But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the ""aggressive pursuit"" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest.",1,Let Freedom Ring
"The Baucus bill ""contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion."" With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate.
And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points.
We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric.
One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter.
We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement is False .
In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill ""contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion.""
If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion.
And that's a big deal.
The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for  abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's  health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay  for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies  to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and  federal employees.
Baucus said he attempted to ""find language that just maintains the status quo"" on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. ""This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill,"" Baucus said.
Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities.
On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, ""We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care."" In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services.
On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get.
According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of  employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not  all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation  survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The  two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant  percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions.
According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance).
The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes.
So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions.
But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services.
That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House.
The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said.
The Hyde Amendment, he said, is ""one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress."" Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it can’t subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is ""a big departure from where we are now.""
Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: ""Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward.
""As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion.""
In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in ""federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion,"" we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill ""abortion neutral"" — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.",1,National Right to Life Committee
"The Obama administration is allowing state waivers from welfare work requirements ""only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent."" Former President Bill Clinton used his elder statesman’s status in the Democratic Party to make the case for Barack Obama’s re-election, while touching on a subject paramount in his own legacy: welfare reform.
In 1996 Clinton signed a landmark bill that transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance for poor Americans that required them to eventually join the workforce.
Mitt Romney, in a campaign ad, has claimed that Obama gutted the work requirement.
Clinton countered that in his Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Here’s what Clinton said really happened:
""When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it’s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge.
""And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less.""
At PolitiFact, we have examined this welfare controversy before . Here, we’ll review the issue in light of Clinton’s new statement.
The HHS memo
Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce.
A July 12, 2012, memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states ""of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""
The memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that ""improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems"" and ""demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities,"" to give two examples.
What does that mean?
""If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures,"" is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.)
The waivers, then, would inject some flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes.
Sebelius’ letter
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
""The proposal we have outlined strengthens the law’s purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state-based innovation. Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work, and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department,"" Sebelius wrote.
She noted how, in 2005, several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority. That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.
Now, some states are again asking for flexibility, Sebelius wrote, naming Utah and Nevada, which both currently have Republican governors. She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements.
""The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state’s past performance,"" Sebelius wrote. ""States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded.""
Because no waivers have yet been approved, it’s difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like.
The policy debate
It’s important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that don’t count currently.
Schott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups, such as two-parent families, possibly by letting them stay in school longer. A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement. That is credit a state doesn’t get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement.
That broader definition has some critics concerned. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow ""state bureaucrats"" to count activities that aren't really work.
""In the past, state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing, attending Weight Watchers, and bed rest as ‘work.’ These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards. Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards, we can expect ‘work’ in the TANF program to mean anything but work,"" Rector argued.
He also wrote , following Clinton’s speech, that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a ""meaningless measure"" because in a typical state 1.5 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month. To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 1.8 percent of recipients gaining employment.
""What will the other 98.2 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure. But one thing we do know for certain: They will be exempt from the federal ‘work participation’ requirements established in the welfare reform law,"" Rector wrote.
Schott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesn’t exempt anyone from working.
""Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual. The waiver is about the state’s performance measurement,"" she said. ""The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet. … Nobody is suggesting waiving that.""
Rector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements. He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions.
""Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived,"" Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review.
His argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius’ waiver proposal is ""subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect."" The Obama administration did not ask for Congress’ approval to grant waivers.",1,Bill Clinton
"""FDR was called a socialist and a communist."" Sound familiar?
The president was accused of being ""a socialist, not a Democrat."" His plan was described as ""undisguised state socialism."" One critic, who controlled some powerful media outlets, suggested that communists had infiltrated the president's administration.
Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he's not unique.
Obama has  mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently, including during an interview on
Late Night with David Letterman
on Sept. 21, 2009:
""What's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up,"" Obama said. ""FDR was called a socialist and a communist.""
Indeed, Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times. Most of that criticism came in the 1930s, when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression.
• ""Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat,"" declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23, 1935. That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt, according to the
New York Times
.
• ""The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism, declared Senator Simeon D. Fess (R-Ohio) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal's leading socialist,"" reported the
Chicago Daily Tribune
on Aug. 7, 1934. ""The president's recent statements,"" Fess said, ""remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism, which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry, or both.""
• ""The Russian newspapers during the last election [1932] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption, 'The first communistic President of the United States,'"" said Sen. Thomas Schall, a Republican from Minnesota. ""Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President, which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country.  In fact, the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions."" We found Schall's comments in the book,
All But the People: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics, 1933-1939
.
And then there's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst.
Hearst, a newspaper mogul, initially supported Roosevelt. But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president's policies. He especially hated Roosevelt's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal.
By 1936, when Roosevelt was running for re-election, Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster.
Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his book
William Randolph Hearst: The Later Years, 1911-1951
:
""On September 6, Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration. The
New York American
published a front-page editorial titled, 'The Radical Brand on the New Deal.' It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon. During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes: that communists had infiltrated the New Deal; that communism was un-American and undemocratic; that 'America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters.'""
That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take. The White House issued a statement that mentioned ""a certain notorious newspaper owner,"" and  rebutted the accusations. The statement concluded, ""The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic, honorable, decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs.""
Hearst shot back in a front-page editorial, which he signed personally. ""Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists, the Frankfurter radicals, communists and anarchists, the Tugwell bolsheviks, and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following,"" Hearst wrote. ""I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government, and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements.""
Hearst's efforts were for naught. Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide, while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy.
There's not much controversy on this one, but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history.",1,Barack Obama
"""Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country."" In a press release responding to a story in the National Enquirer, the McCain campaign declared that ""Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country.""
It's a line that has clearly become a campaign talking point — repeated by staffers and supporters alike such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
If the limit of your interest on this issue is whether it's true that Palin is an extremely popular governor in Alaska, we'll save you some time: the answer is an unqualified yes.
But we wanted to find out if she is
the
most popular, as the McCain campaign said. That's a more complicated — and ultimately squishy — issue.
You won't find a poll that on one day asked a large sample of residents in every state to rate their governor.
What you have is a hodgepodge of polls taken on different days in different states, often asking people different versions of whether they like their governor. For example, you might have one poll asking simply whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the governor; and another that asks you to rate the guv's performance as excellent, good, fair or poor. It'd be unfair to compare those head-to-head.
And not to make your head hurt, but there's a difference between personal approval ratings and job approval ratings. Bill Clinton, for example, had high job approval ratings but low personal approval ratings.
So what do we know about Palin's approval ratings among Alaskans? They are remarkably high.
A May 2007 poll taken by Ivan Moore Research in Alaska put Palin's positive rating at 89 percent. That's off the charts high. But Moore's survey wasn't a traditional approval rating or job performance measure. Rather, respondents were asked to rate their feelings toward public figures as very or somewhat positive or very or somewhat negative. The verys and somewhats were then combined.
A poll two weeks before that one, from Dittman Research, gave Palin a 93 percent approval rating.
The Moore poll numbers hit a low of 76 percent in mid July — in the midst of ""Troopergate"" coverage — but bounced back to 80 percent in mid August. That mirrored a Hays Research Group poll on July 24 and 25 in which 80 percent rated Palin's performance as somewhat or very favorable.
Moore hasn't polled similar questions in other states, so he wouldn't say categorically that Palin's are the highest in the country. ""But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know 89 percent is going to be at the top of the list,"" Moore said.
On Sept. 3, the McCain campaign released results of an American Viewpoint poll on Sept. 2 — after the announcement of Palin as McCain's running mate — that found Palin had an 86 percent overall job approval rating. That was a poll commissioned by the McCain campaign, so take that for what it's worth.
Again, these are extraordinarily high numbers by any measure. But according to Rasmussen polls, Palin gave up her crown as ""most popular"" in July, overtaken by North Dakota's Gov. John Hoeven.
A Rasmussen poll on July 30 found 64% of voters rate Palin's job performance as excellent or good versus 14% who view it as poor. On July 8, Hoeven clocked 72 percent at excellent or good against just 6 percent who rated his performance as poor.
Scott Rasmussen, founder and CEO of Rasmussen Reports, said people shouldn't get hung up on whether someone ranked No. 1 or 2. Those numbers change with the political winds of the day.
""In a broader sense, she (Palin) is one of the very top,"" Rasmussen said.
The polling firm SurveyUSA has in the past conducted governor's approval ratings in all 50 states, but not since Palin took office.
In 2006, the highest ratings were around 80 percent.
The ratings being reported in Alaska for Palin are ""extraordinarily high,"" said Jay Leve, editor of SurveyUSA. ""Those kinds of numbers are unprecedented.""
And based on the previous highs for approval ratings, he said, it's highly likely Palin is now top dog.
Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report, and John McIntyre, managing editor at Real Clear Politics — two groups that pay close attention to such things — also believe Palin's numbers rank her as the most popular.
""It's difficult to make a categorical statement like that,"" McIntyre said. ""But generally, they are on pretty solid ground. If I was a betting person, I bet that's an accurate statement. Once your approval rating is over 80 percent, it's a little silly.""
Bottom line, most experts say the McCain campaign is probably right.",1,John McCain
"McCain sought the political support of minister John Hagee, ""who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'"" Note to readers: An update was posted to this item on May 23, 2008, to reflect new information. See note at the end of this story.
In an e-mail to supporters, the liberal group MoveOn.org listed reasons people should not support Sen. John McCain for president.
""McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years,"" the e-mail said. ""McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'""
Some of MoveOn's points are correct. McCain has accepted an endorsement from Hagee, an evangelical minister with a national following. Since MoveOn's e-mail went out, however, Hagee has renounced his previous controversial statements.
Hagee heads the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, with 17,000 members. He has a nationally syndicated television show, John Hagee Today, a sprawling Web site and numerous books. His dominant issue is the defense of Israel: He founded the advocacy group Christians United for Israel in 2006, and his book Jerusalem Countdown takes grim satisfaction in predicting a nuclear confrontation in the Middle East with the United States and Israel on one side and Iran on the other.
Hagee's endorsement of McCain on Feb. 27, 2008, set off several rounds of controversy. The day after the endorsement, the Catholic League called Hagee an anti-Catholic bigot and lamented McCain's connection to him. The Catholic League monitors anti-Catholic bias and emphasizes Catholic teaching on abortion and other moral issues. It pointed to a video of Hagee in which Hagee discusses the Book of Revelation and the Catholic Church. Hagee clearly uses the words ""Antichrist"" and ""false cult"" as he discusses the Catholic Church, the Crusades and the Holocaust. (His statements are a little confusing; watch the video here.)
Hagee said he was only criticizing historical acts of anti-Semitism by the Catholic Church, not expressing anti-Catholic hatred. But Catholic League president Bill Donahue said Hagee's excuses weren't credible and continued calls for McCain to distance himself.
During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on April 20, McCain said he still welcomed Hagee's endorsement but strongly condemned ""any comments that he made about the Catholic church.""
The Catholic League was satisfied with McCain's comments but continued to criticize Hagee. On May 13, Hagee released a letter sent directly to Donahue in which Hagee expressed regret for his previous statements about the Catholic Church. Donahue accepted the apology.
""The tone of Hagee's letter is sincere,"" Donahue said in a statement. ""He wants reconciliation and he has achieved it. Indeed, the Catholic League welcomes his apology.""
While the back-and-forth was going on about the Catholic Church, Hagee also retracted his previous comments about Hurricane Katrina. Hagee had said in an interview on Sept 16, 2006:
""The newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade on the Monday that the Katrina came, and the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades. So I believe that the judgment of God is a very real thing. I know that there are people who demure from that, but I believe that the Bible teaches that when you violate the law of God, that God brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment, and I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was, in fact, the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans.""
A publicist for Hagee sent us this statement dated April 25, 2008:
""As a believing Christian, I see the hand of God in everything that happens here on earth, both the blessings and the curses. But ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina. I should not have suggested otherwise.""
Hagee's modest backtracking isn't that surprising, said John C. Green, a senior fellow in religion and politics at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, a nonpartisan research group that does not take positions in policy debates. Hard-charging rhetoric against the Catholic Church and other religions such as Judaism or Islam used to be more common among evangelical leaders, but it's now falling out of favor, Green said.
""Most evangelicals today don't use that kind of harsh language, because they've discovered it has negative effects,"" Green said. ""It's hard to make converts when you use that harsh language with them, and they've also realized it's not appropriate.""
Of course, we can't definitively rule on whether Hagee's new statements represent a true change of heart or just a political repositioning.
MoveOn's attack was true when the group sent out the e-mail; it was only later that Hagee retracted his comments.
UPDATE:
On May 22, 2008, McCain rejected the pastor's endorsement, after audio of Hagee preaching, reportedly during the 1990s, was posted to the Internet. In the recording, Hagee implied that Hilter and the Holocaust were part of God's plan to create the state of Israel. (Listen to the audio here .)
McCain said Hagee's comments were ""deeply offensive and indefensible,"" and ""I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee's endorsement, and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well.""
Hagee, meanwhile, issued a statement saying that he was withdrawing his endorsement and that critics were distorting his views.
""I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues,"" Hagee said on May 22, 2008. ""I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Sen. McCain for president effective today, and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign.""",1,MoveOn.org
"""When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper . . . and we would fry squirrel."" In two recent appearances on MSNBC's
Morning Joe
, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee boasted about frying squirrels in a popcorn popper.
""When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper – because that was the only thing they would let us use in the dorms – and we would fry squirrel,"" he said on Jan. 18, 2008.
When he appeared on the show three weeks later, on Feb. 6, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked him if he would come back and demonstrate his cooking techniques.
""I'm really ready to do that,"" Huckabee said. ""Because I think the country needs to be able to somehow get into those kind of culinary delights that they've been missing for a long time.""
Forgive us, but we were skeptical.
We wondered if the former governor was truly an aficionado of cooked rodents, or if he was just making a play for the all-important squirrel-eating Republican voting bloc.
So we tracked down Huckabee's roommate from Ouachita Baptist University, Rick Caldwell, to ask if the governor really had eaten squirrel.
""I was there,"" Caldwell said, quickly adding that ""I was not a co-conspirator to the actual frying of the squirrel. But I admit to partaking.""
Indeed, they had a popcorn popper in their room in the Daniel North dormitory in 1973 and Huckabee was quite the enterprising chef, said Caldwell, a longtime friend who is now an adviser to his presidential campaign.
Huckabee devised a way to make faux doughnuts by punching holes in the middle of biscuits and then frying them in the popcorn popper. Once they were cooked, Huckabee and Caldwell would roll them in sugar. Caldwell says it was as good as a Krispy Kreme.
The squirrel fry was a one-time thing, Caldwell said. A student living down the hall admired the popcorn popper and suggested it would be good for frying a squirrel. Caldwell was out of the room when they cooked it, but he got to sample the meat when he returned.
""It tasted like chicken,"" Caldwell said.
No one on the PolitiFact staff had sampled a squirrel, so we turned to ""Bayou Bill"" Scifres, a retired outdoors writer from the
Indianapolis Star
who runs All Outdoors, a Web site that offers advice on cooking wild game.
Bayou Bill loves a qood squirrel.
""There are so many ways to cook 'em!"" he told us. ""With hot biscuits and gravy and fried squirrel and corn on the cob – it's like dying and going to heaven!""
He said cooking them is easy:
""Fry them to a beautiful golden brown on all sides and then turn the heat down; cover the skillet and put in water or maybe good cooking wine. You just let them steam in that for 15 minutes or half an hour,"" he said
We found recipes on other Web sites that also looked promising: squirrel cacciatore, squirrel croquettes and squirrels in cream sauce.

"Obama served on a board with former Weather Underground member William Ayers and ""that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11."" A little-known relationship in Sen. Barack Obama's past — one that had been buzzing in mostly conservative circles for months — took a very public turn Wednesday night during a Democratic debate in Philadelphia.
It relates to Obama's relationship with William C. Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement. Known as the Weathermen, the group was responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972.
During the debate, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about his relationship with Ayers, as part of a discussion about Obama's patriotism.
""An early organizing meeting for your state Senate campaign was held at his house and your campaign has said you are 'friendly,' "" Stephanopoulos said.
Stephanopoulos quoted a New York Times story, published Sept. 11, 2001, in which Ayers was quoted as saying: ""I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough.""
Asked Stephanopoulos: ""Can you explain that relationship for the voters and explain to Democrats why it won't be a problem?""
Obama downplayed the relationship.
""This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from,"" Obama said. ""He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.
""And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn't make much sense, George.""
Sen. Hillary Clinton then piled on.
""I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time, the Woods Foundation, which was a paid directorship position. And, if I'm not mistaken, that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments, which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more.""
We need to point out that it was merely a coincidence the remarks were published in the New York Times on Sept. 11 and they had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks that day. They were referring to activities by the Weather Underground in the 1970s.
Deborah Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago, said Obama was a director from 1994 through 2001. That overlaps Ayers' time as a director by three years. It also means Obama served with Ayers for the final months of 2001, after Ayers made his comments to the New York Times.
Ayers, now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago (not English as Obama stated), is still on the seven-member Woods Fund board.
In 2001, Ayers wrote a book, ''Fugitive Days'' — he called it a memoir — in which he wrote that he participated in the bombings of New York City police headquarters, the Capitol building and the Pentagon. But in a review of the book, the New York Times noted that Ayers coyly noted that some of the book was fiction.
Last week, Ayers defended the September 2001 comments on his blog stating: ""I'm sometimes asked if I regret anything I did to oppose the war in Vietnam and I say: No, I don't regret anything I did to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government.""
Obama has minimized his relationship with Ayers. Campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama's re-election campaign in 2001.
In the spirit of fairness, we should note that just before leaving office, President Bill Clinton pardoned Susan L. Rosenberg who, according to a New York Times story in 2001, was ""a onetime member of the Weather Underground terrorist group who was charged in the notorious 1981 Brink's robbery in Rockland County that left a guard and two police officers dead.""",1,Hillary Clinton
"McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan. Sen. John McCain has praised the surge in Iraq for bringing greater stability to the region, and has reminded voters that he long supported it. But while Iraq was stabilizing, the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating.
So on July 15, 2008, the McCain campaign released ""a new comprehensive strategy for victory in Afghanistan"" that applies ""the tried and true principles of counterinsurgency used in the Iraq surge.""
His new policy includes sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan. ""Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available,"" states the campaign's strategy outline.
Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pounced on this news. By the end of the week, spokesman Bill Burton had sent out a memo titled, ""Obama leading on foreign policy, McCain following.""
""This past week, Senator McCain changed his position for political reasons, embracing Obama's call for more troops the day after Obama restated it in a New York Times op-ed, and almost one year after Obama's initial plan,"" Burton wrote.
We reviewed the candidates' past statements to determine whether McCain has changed position to match Obama.
Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.
The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. ""If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will,"" Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings here , here and here. )
But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan.
""Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve,"" Obama said. ""As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban.""
In the months that followed, Obama repeatedly emphasized his assertion that the United States ""had taken our eye off the ball"" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan.
McCain, meanwhile, has rebutted Obama by saying that Iraq is and should be the central front on the war on terror. We couldn't find examples of McCain specifically rejecting Obama's proposal to send more troops to Afghanistan. Neither could we find examples of him supporting more brigades in Afghanistan, which likely would raise logistical questions about whether there were enough troops for a surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, when it came to Afghanistan, McCain emphasized the need for NATO countries to do their part, and for the United States and NATO forces to better manage troop levels and logistics.
As recently as July 8, 2008, McCain emphasized these points. During an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, McCain talked at length about NATO, saying only that it was possible the United States might have to add more troops, but not specifically endorsing that position. Here's the exchange:
Question: ""Senator, you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead — could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance. Beyond Pakistan, what do you think it takes for the U.S. to succeed there? Is more troops the answer?""
McCain: ""I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face. One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq. I think that has a direct impact on the region. But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective, the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed, the economic progress, again this is one of these situations where you've got to maintain the security environment, but then you've got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to. And one of the failures, because of corruption, has been that we haven't made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasn't as well used as perhaps it could have. But again, I can't tell you that there's one solution to it with the struggle military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, it's all of one and yet it has various aspects. And I just finally would say, and I'm sorry for some wrong answers, but we are in this with other nations. That's important. And I'm glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there. I'm glad that many of our allies, I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things. But the fact is this is a — this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest.""
Question: ""Do you think more troops should — do you think — some of the military have called for more additional troops ...""
McCain: ""I think yes, and I'd love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways. I'd love to see that. And we may have to send additional troops. As you know, they just extended the Marine unit there by an additional 30 days. And I think they had — they did that very reluctantly.""
A week later, McCain would specifically advocate sending three more brigades to Afghanistan.
One point McCain has made again and again on the campaign trail is that, when it comes to foreign policy, he bases his opinions on ""conditions on the ground."" His new policy on Afghanistan can fairly be interpreted as a reaction to those conditions, which have demonstrably worsened in the weeks before his announcement. The Obama campaign has said that McCain has changed position on Afghanistan for political reasons, to follow Obama. We are not ruling on McCain's motivation here; the McCain campaign can just as easily argue that McCain has changed position because circumstances have changed. From a political standpoint, it's certainly inconvenient when ""conditions on the ground"" dictate you dropping your position for your opponent's.
Be all that as it may, Obama advocated more troops for Afghanistan about a year ago. McCain only recently embraced the same position. We rule this claim is True.",1,Barack Obama
"""Last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter."" Wasn't this supposed to be the next Great Depression?
So we were surprised to hear the chair of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer, claim that experts are saying the economy will start to recover later this year.
We suspected her claim, at the very least, lacked a bit of context. Which it does.
She made it on the March 15 Meet the Press , after host David Gregory played a recent tape of her saying ""most people are predicting"" positive growth in the economy ""some time in the second half of the year.""
Romer, whom Obama recruited from the University of California-Berkeley, stood by that. ""I should say my prediction is very much what most private forecasters are saying,"" she said. ""We know that this last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter.""
Blue Chip Economic Indicators
is a monthly newsletter by specialty publisher Wolters Kluwer Law & Business. It claims to survey ""America's leading business economists"" and compiles their economic forecasts. It serves a blue-chip audience: A one-year subscription costs $875.
The consensus, or average prediction of the panelists, was that the economy as measured by the gross domestic product would grow 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
That was not quite enough information to gauge the accuracy of Romer’s claim, so we asked editor Randell Moore for more detail. He said 50 economists were surveyed, with 30 predicting positive growth in the third quarter of 2009 and 45 predicting positive growth in the fourth quarter.
That does indeed support Romer’s claim, since 45 out of 50 constitutes ""almost all"" the forecasters.
Some context is in order, though. The 19-page report was hardly rosy. In fact, it was more pessimistic than the previous month's issue.
The issue's summary was titled, ""The Longest, Deepest Recession Since World War II"" and it said, ""The economy still is expected to emerge from recession by the end of this year but consensus forecasts of economic growth in 2010 slipped lower once again this month.""
The forecasters predicted that for 2009 as a whole, the economy is expected to shrink 2.6 percent, the largest annual contraction since the Great Depression. That was worse than the prior month’s prediction of 1.9 percent.
There were some glimmers of hope in there, but they came amid glum news, as in this sentence: ""They say it’s always darkest before the dawn. Well, this week bordered on a full-scale blackout.""
Also, we should add a general note of caution about the reliability of the newsletter. The economists surveyed work for companies such as JPMorgan Chase, General Motors Corp., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Fannie Mae, all of which have decidedly less-than-sterling track records of late.
As a
New York Times
writer noted in January , ""these professional forecasters are typically employed by investment banks, trade associations and big corporations. They base their forecasts on computer models that tend to see the American economy as basically sound, even in the worst of times.""
The
New York Times
article added, ""They did not see a recession until late summer. One reason they were blindsided: Their computer models do not easily account for emotional factors like the shock from the credit crisis and falling housing prices that have so hindered borrowing and spending.""
Very few economists predicted the current economic crisis. One who did, New York University professor and noted pessimist Nouriel Roubini (who is not a Blue Chip panelist), said on March 9 that he saw ""no hope for the recession ending in 2009 and (it) will more than likely last into 2010.""
But Romer is entitled to highlight optimistic forecasts. And it's true that almost all the panelists surveyed in
Blue Chip Economic Indicators
predicted a rebound by the fourth quarter of 2009.",1,Christina Romer
"""Sen. McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of (Iraq)."" Sen. Barack Obama, speaking to veterans, lashed into his opponent for poor military judgment, alleging Sen. John McCain had fixated on Iraq immediately after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
""Sen. McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that — as despicable as Saddam Hussein was — posed no imminent threat to the American people,"" Obama said on Aug. 19, 2008. ""Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al-Qaida's leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America's focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region.""
Obama's analysis of the war's consequences aside, we checked the record to see whether he had fairly characterized McCain's views about Iraq after 9/11 and in the run-up to the war.
As a military veteran and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain was a prominent voice in late 2001 as the nation grappled with how to respond to the attacks.
On Sept. 12, 2001, he appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews, where Matthews asked whether the appropriate response should be ""a legal matter or a military matter.""
""I think it's both,"" McCain replied. ""As — as we stated, the — a nation has the right to defend itself, No. 1. But No. 2, these organizations could not flourish effectively unless they had the help and assistance and safe harbor of these nations. And it isn't just Afghanistan — we're talking about Syria, Iraq, Iran, perhaps North Korea, Libya and others.""
That comment was not particularly specific to Iraq. But in an Oct. 18, 2001, appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, with the nation on edge about the anthrax mailings and in the early stages of the campaign in Afganistan, McCain singled out Iraq.
After sharing his views about how events were unfolding in Afghanistan, McCain told Letterman: ""I think we'll do fine. The second phase — if I could just make one, very quickly — the second phase is Iraq. There is some indication, and I don't have the conclusions, but some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq.""
In January 2002, while touring the flight bridge of an aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea, McCain shouted: ""Next up: Baghdad!""
He fleshed out his views in a speech at a NATO security policy conference in Munich on Feb. 2, 2002.
""Terrorist training camps exist on Iraqi soil, and Iraqi officials are known to have had a number of contacts with al-Qaida. These were probably not courtesy calls,"" he said. ""Americans have internalized the mantra that Afghanistan represents only the first front in our global war on terror. The next front is apparent, and we should not shrink from acknowledging it. A terrorist resides in Baghdad, with the resources of an entire state at his disposal, flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade-long record of defying the international community's demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.""
We should note that McCain suggested on several occasions that he would prefer alternatives to full-on invasion and occupation as a means of displacing Saddam Hussein, such as on Meet the Press on July 14, 2002:
""I have always strongly felt that you must try the option of opposition from within — arming, training, equipping and helping oppositions from within; the Kurds in the North, the Shiites in the South,"" McCain told the late Tim Russert. ""At least try that option before we send Americans into harm's way.""
But two days later on Face the Nation, he made clear that if it took war to remove Hussein, he was all for it.
""Look, we need a regime change in Iraq,"" he said. ""If we can do it on the cheap by having operations involving just Special Forces and some air power and opponents within, either the Kurds in the south, Shiites in the north [sic], then that's fine. But we have to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to bring about this regime change. I think we also ought to prepare the American public in — in — by way of informing them that Saddam Hussein has these weapons, continues to attempt to improve the — their capability and would not be reluctant to export them to other countries.""
He continued, ""So we need to keep telling the American people that as well, as well as basically — if I may be so blunt — frightening them — frightening and scaring them every day.""
In early 2003, with calls for invasion of Iraq growing more insistent, McCain's was among the most fervent voices.
""Sept. 11, 2001 showed that al-Qaida is a grave threat,"" he wrote in a Feb. 14, 2003 opinion piece in USA Today. ""Saddam Hussein has the ability to make a far worse day of infamy by turning Iraq into a weapons assembly line for al-Qaida's network. ... Saddam is an international felon who has repeatedly violated the terms of his parole and is planning further crimes with his terrorist accomplices. He must be brought to justice once and for all.""
The record clearly supports the contention that McCain ""was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11"" — indeed he singled out Iraq on Letterman — and became a ""leading supporter"" of the war, as Obama said.",1,Barack Obama
"""Sen. Obama has declared, and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions."" The issue of whether or not to meet diplomatically with the leaders of enemy nations is clearly shaping into an important wedge issue in the presidential campaign.
Sen. John McCain has hammered Sen. Barack Obama for saying he would meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is well known for his anti-America, anti-Israel rhetoric.
""Sen. Obama has declared, and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions, likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union,"" McCain said in remarks before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008.
McCain argues this position ""betrays the depth of Sen. Obama's inexperience and reckless judgment.""
While McCain has criticized Obama's approach of meeting with leaders of isolated nations in general, McCain has particularly singled out Ahmadinejad.
""What does he (Obama) want to talk about with Ahmadinejad, who said that Israel is a stinking corpse?"" McCain asked. ""Who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, who is sending the most explosive devices into Iraq killing Americans. What does he want to talk about?""
Perhaps sensing political vulnerability on the issue, McCain's campaign fired off a number of press releases accusing the Obama campaign of trying to back off Obama's stated position.
When asked in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer how Obama could defend meeting without preconditions with Ahmadinejad, Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, Susan Rice, said Obama had promised only that he'd meet with the appropriate Iranian leadership ""not necessarily Ahmadinejad.""
More fuel was added to the debate when Joe Klein of Time magazine wrote in his blog that he could find no instance where Obama said he would negotiate specifically, by name, with Ahmadinejad.
""He (Obama) did say that he would negotiate with the Iranian leadership -- but, on matters of foreign policy and Iran's nuclear program, the guy in charge is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,"" Klein noted.
""Why doesn't the McCain campaign and other assorted Republicans ever accuse Obama of wanting to negotiate with Khamenei? Well, because Khamenei isn't quite the flagrant anti-Semite Ahmadinejad is ... and, as we keep hearing, Obama has a Jewish problem.""
To be sure, when Obama raises this issue -- which he does often on the stump -- he usually says, generically, that he will meet diplomatically with the ""leaders"" of America's enemies.
For example, when asked in a press conference in Watertown, S.D., on May 16, 2008, about the McCain campaign accusing him of trying to distance himself from comments about meeting with the leaders of rogue nations, Obama said he hasn't distanced himself at all.
""I say that in every town hall meeting that we have and every rally,"" Obama said. ""What I have said is that I will meet with not just our allies and our friends but I will initiate tough diplomacy with our enemies. That includes Syria, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. I would meet with them and I would meet with them without preconditions although with preparation. I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior. If it was in the case of Iran, stop threatening Israel, stand down on nuclear weapons development; stop funding Hamas and Hezbollah and stop stirring up problems inside of Iraq. If they are willing to change behavior, then, we would offer inducements and benefits diplomatically. If they don't, we will continue to ratchet sanctions and isolations on Iran. That has been a consistent policy that I have presented throughout. There are no contradictions. I have no idea where it is that they are suggesting that somehow there has been a change in policy.
But has Obama said specifically that he'd meet with Ahmadinejad?
We could find no public statements where Obama neatly says, ""I will meet with Ahmadinejad."" But we believe there are some instances where that was the substance of Obama's words.
One example came in a press conference in New York City on Sept. 24, 2007.
Question: ""Senator, you've said before that you'd meet with President Ahmadinejad. … Would you still meet with him today?""
""Nothing's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries,"" Obama responded. ""I find many of President Ahmadinejad's statements odious and I've said that repeatedly. And I think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that don't have American interests at heart. But what I also believe is that, as John F. Kennedy said, we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate. And by us listening to the views even of those who we violently disagree with – that sends a signal to the world that we are going to turn the page on the failed diplomacy that the Bush Administration has practiced for so long.""
The McCain campaign provided snippets of news accounts of that press conference that left little doubt how the press interpreted Obama's comments at the time. Check out these headlines: ""Obama Stood His Ground Monday On His Controversial Remarks Earlier This Year That He Would Meet With Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"" (from CNN); and ""Obama: I Would Still Meet With Ahmadinejad"" (from CBS News).
In a Nov. 11, 2007, interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Obama again mentioned Ahmadinejad when discussing his open-door policy.
""Part of the reason it's important for us to talk to countries we don't like and leaders we don't like, it's not that I think that in a conversation with somebody like Ahmadinejad that I'm going to somehow change his mind on everything, but what we do is, we send a signal to other leadership in Iran, to the Iranian people and to the world community that we are listening and that we are willing to try to resolve conflicts peacefully.""
Host Tim Russert asked if Obama was afraid of being used in a propaganda way.
""I've got to say I'm not afraid of losing a propaganda war to somebody like Ahmadinejad,"" Obama said. ""You know, strong countries and strong presidents speak with their adversaries.""
In those contexts, Obama clearly counts Ahmadinejad among those with whom he would meet.",1,John McCain
"Says Jeb Bush ""flip-flop-flip(ped) on immigration."" Jeb Bush was for it before he was against it.
And now he’s for it again?
That’s the refrain these days on where the former Florida governor stands on creating a process for people in the U.S. illegally to eventually become American citizens -- or something secondary to that, such as legal residents. Since his new book Immigration Wars was released this week, Bush has been accused of changing position.
"" @JebBush a flip-flop-flip on immigration? Wow. I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast. My bad. #notsurprisedatall ,"" Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a tweet on March 5, 2013.
Bush, 60, has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007. But with the release of his book, Bush has indicated he’s considering a future presidential run (""I’m not saying yes, I’m just not saying no,"" he told MSNBC).
We found that Bush, now a definite maybe for 2016, has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants.
‘Start deporting people’
Bush, a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state, plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.
Back then, there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. into citizens. When asked what to do with them, Bush had one word: deportation.
In an interview with the Miami Herald, he was asked, ""There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States . . . . What would you do with the ones that are here?""
""Start deporting people,"" he answered. ""We have an asylum process . . . . It shouldn't take five years. We need to reform our system. ... I don't blame them for wanting to come to our country, but I don't believe it's necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in.""
But he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border. ""I believe in open, legal immigration,"" Bush said.
He lost that election, but stormed back four years later and won the governor’s race.
By 2006, Bush was well-established as Florida’s chief executive, and he wasn’t afraid to criticize members of his own party. His views, it seems, had evolved beyond ""start deporting people.""
In an email exchange with the Los Angeles Times that year, Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation, calling it ""just plain wrong"" to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed ""penalizing the children of illegal immigrants"" by denying them U.S. citizenship.
He endorsed the idea of a broad guest-worker program, but the Los Angeles Times noted then that he ""offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship.""
In 2009, Bush co-chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations, which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals. In an interview about the group’s recommendations, Bush said that if reform doesn’t happen, ""we ignore an issue that needs to be solved, which is what do we do with people who are here permanently, who have made contributions, who if given a path to citizenship would do what's right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship.""
However, in a separate op-ed about the task force recommendations, Bush simply said reform should include ""a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally.""
2012: Bush stakes his position
Last year, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self-deport -- a position later faulted for Republicans’ poor showing among Hispanic voters.
Bush, meanwhile, continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a ""broader approach"" to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration. In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose, he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship.
""You have to deal with this issue. You can’t ignore it. And so, either a path to citizenship, which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives; Or a path to legalization, a path to residency of some kind,"" he said.
Fast forward past the election. It’s now 2013, and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship.
But Bush’s book, which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012, split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency. And in print, Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed ""a path to permanent legal resident status.""
""Permanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship. ... A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage.""
Illegal immigrants, he and co-author Clint Bolick wrote, could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels.
After immediately catching heat over the book -- and how it conflicts with his past position -- Bush began softening up.
""We wrote this book last year, not this year, and we proposed a path to legalization, so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization,"" Bush said on MSNBC.
He added: ""If you can craft that in law, where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn’t an incentive for people to come illegally, I’m for it. I don’t have a problem with that.""
He told CNN: ""I have supported both — both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship — with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally.""
Jaryn Emhof, Bush’s communications director, told PolitiFact in an email, ""The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants -- whether they are coming to work temporarily, to go to school, to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship -- can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before. So, it is talking about future immigrants, not those currently here illegally.""
We think it’s clear, however, that the book’s passages about legal status vs. citizenship very clearly refer to those already here.",1,Debbie Wasserman Schultz
"""The president campaigned against this type of legislation."" Speaking on the House floor, Republican Leader John Boehner railed against a spending bill with some 9,000 earmarks, calling on President Obama to veto it and insist on one free of pet projects.
""The president campaigned against this type of legislation, this number of earmarks,"" the Ohio Republican said on Feb. 25, ""and I would hope that the president would veto this bill because Republicans in Congress will be here to uphold his veto of this piece of legislation.""
Several news organizations made even harsher claims. The
New York Times
, for example, reported that Obama would sign the bill, earmarks and all, ""despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice.""
That's incorrect. Obama did not promise to end earmarking, only to ""reform"" it, and eliminate ""screwy"" or wasteful earmarks.
Boehner, however, was more careful than the
New York Times.
His claim that Obama ""campaigned against this type of legislation"" could be read a number of ways.
Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said Boehner meant that Obama had broken his campaign pledges, referenced on the White House Web site , to ""slash earmarks to no greater than 1994 levels and ensure all spending decisions are open to the public."" That's a reasonable interpretation of what Boehner said.
Obama did indeed make those pledges during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate, pledged to eliminate earmarks and ""veto every earmark pork-barrel bill,"" and Obama, though stopping short of that, did pledge to get tough on them.
For example, here's Obama in the first presidential debate : ""Absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.""
On March 10, 2008, Obama said in a statement : ""We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress' seniority, rather than the merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high-priced D.C. lobbyists to do it. And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country.""
And here he is on Feb. 21, 2008 : ""I have been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks. Now, keep in mind a lot of these are worthy projects in our states, and I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says this is the kind of spending that I think is important.""
The closest he came to saying he would eliminate earmarks, as far as we could find, was when he said, in the third presidential debate , ""Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem."" (Given his other campaign statements on earmarks, it's clear he meant ""screwy,"" or wasteful, earmarks should be eliminated, not all earmarks.)
So the question is, is the omnibus spending bill the ""type of legislation"" that Obama campaigned against with respect to earmarks? That is, did it lack transparency, include earmarks based on a congressman's seniority and ones that are wasteful? And was the amount more than the 1994 level of $7.8 billion a year?
The answer to most of those questions is largely yes, said Keith Ashdown, investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. Ashdown said the earmarking process for the omnibus bill was not any more transparent than it was when Obama was campaigning. He said seven of the top 10 earmark recipients in the Senate are on the Appropriations Committee, suggesting that access was more important than merit when it came to deciding what projects would get earmarks.
And though the total cost of the earmarks in the bill, $7.7 billion, is slightly less than the 1994 level, there were another $6.6 billion in earmarks in three previous spending bills for this year that Congress passed last year.
Are there wasteful projects in the bill? Ashdown said he hasn't had time to research that. ""There likely is, but I just don't know,"" he said. He cautioned against leaping to conclusions about projects that ""sound goofy."" For example, some critics have mocked a $1 million earmark to control Mormon crickets in Utah — but Ashdown said the Mormon cricket, a type of katydid, is a very serious threat to agriculture.
The White House has argued that Obama should not be held responsible for the earmarking process in this legislative package — which is nine of the 12 spending bills for the current budget year rolled into one — because it is ""last year's business.""
And there's some truth to that. These are bills that Congress was supposed to pass last year.
But that doesn't nullify Boehner's point that the bill is — in featuring earmarks added by senior members of Congress in a process that lacked transparency and pushed earmark spending for the year well over $7.8 billion — the ""type of legislation"" Obama campaigned against.",1,John Boehner
"The Senate health care bill ""would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage."" Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, whom Democrats had once hoped to woo for bipartisan support of a health care bill, attacked the version put forth on Nov. 18, 2009, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
""Like the Pelosi bill, the Reid bill is government-centered, not patient-centered,"" Enzi said ""It’s chock-full of new taxes and higher health care costs that would threaten jobs, weaken our economy, punish families and small businesses trying to make ends meet, and stick our children and grandchildren with the bill.""
That's all pretty standard fare from Republican opponents of the Democratic health care plans being debated in Congress. But we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the Wyoming senator, that the Senate bill ""would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage.""
That uninsured figure cited by Enzi comes from an analysis of the Reid bill by the Congressional Budget Office. The report concludes that under the Reid bill, the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent. Specifically, the report estimated that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million by 2019, leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured.
So who are those 24 million who would be left uninsured?
About a third of them are illegal immigrants, the CBO report states.
So who are the other two-thirds (16 million) left uninsured?
We asked three health care experts: John Holahan at the Urban Institute; Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University; and Kathleen D. Stoll, director of Health Policy at Families USA. They said those people mostly fall into several main categories:
•
People who are deemed able to afford health insurance but simply decide the tax penalties are not high enough to persuade them to buy it. Some young, healthy people, for example, may decide it's cheaper to simply pay the tax penalty rather than purchase insurance, Stoll said. The same is true for some wealthy people who are self-insured.
""These are basically people who say, 'It's not worth it to me,' "" Ku said.
•
People exempt from tax penalties because the cost of health insurance comes to more than 8 percent of their income, even if they are getting federal subsidies. These are generally people with a lower income, but not so low as to qualify for Medicaid. Without a penalty, many of those people may decide to continue not to buy insurance.
""These are people on the lower end of the income scale, but not the poorest of the poor,"" Ku said, generally people who make anywhere from 133 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level.
•
People who are eligible for Medicaid, but simply don't sign up. Some people just think it's a hassle to sign up for insurance, even when it's free, Ku said.
About 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid today simply don't sign up, Holahan said. ""People with very low incomes don't always know how to navigate a lot of things in life. People don't necessarily value health care, and they don't take the time to fill out the necessary paperwork.""
•
Then there are those who are in transitional stages of life -- perhaps a job change -- and don't take steps to close the insurance gaps between jobs.
The CBO report found that the Senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the House. While the Senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million (leaving 24 million uninsured), the House plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about 36 million, leaving about 18 million uninsured.
That's largely because the House tax penalty for not getting insurance is a lot harsher. Under the House bill, people who refuse to purchase health insurance will be hit with a tax penalty equivalent to 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. The Senate plan calls for a tax penalty of $95 in 2014, going up to $350 in 2015, $750 in 2016, and graduated up in ensuing years based on inflation adjustments.
Given differences between the House and Senate bills that cause the Senate plan to leave more uninsured, we certainly think it's fair for a senator to criticize the plan in that regard.
But since this criticism comes from a Republican senator, we would be remiss if we did not point out several other political realities.
A CBO analysis of the main Republican health care plan, which was put forward by House Republican leader John Boehner, concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about 3 million people (as opposed to 31 million in the Reid plan).
""It has not been a particularly high priority for the Republican Party to expand the number of people who get health insurance coverage,"" Ku said.
Again, a third of the people who would remain uninsured under the Reid plan are illegal immigrants. You may recall that many Republicans criticized Democrats for not taking enough precautions to ensure that illegal immigrants are barred from a public option and also argued that illegal immigrants ought to be prohibited from buying insurance in any government-sponsored health insurance exchange.
And the biggest factor accounting for fewer uninsured in the Reid plan, as opposed to the House plan, is that the Senate plan has less severe penalties for those who do not buy insurance. But many conservatives have criticized Democrats for the mandate, arguing that the government ought not get involved in requiring health insurance.
Still, the bottom line is that Enzi said the Reid plan would leave 24 million people uninsured, and the CBO confirms that figure.",1,Mike Enzi

"Says new Medicare billing guidelines ""have nine codes for (injuries by) turkeys."" Doctors’ offices, already burdened by federal billing bureaucracy, will soon find themselves pecked to death by new rules, Texas congressman Ted Poe says.
New diagnosis codes required for reimbursement are so specific, he told Fox Business Network host John Stossel, there are a set of them just for injuries caused by turkeys.
""Whether you run into a turkey or the turkey runs into you, you're pecked by a turkey or you're bitten by a turkey, there's a difference between being pecked and being bitten,"" he said in an interview April 25, 2013. ""So they have nine codes for turkeys.""
Poe, a fifth-term Republican who’s a member of the Tea Party Caucus, argues doctors shouldn’t have to face the expense of complying with new rules or penalties for screwing up.
""Do they need to go through this much detail to get information to the federal government? I don’t think they do,"" he said.
We had to know: Do new Medicare billing guidelines include ""nine codes for turkeys""?
Outdated codes
First, a little background about this code thing. It’s not just a U.S. system — it’s international.
(And in case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with Obamacare.)
The ""new"" set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as ICD-10 . ""ICD"" stands for ""International Classification of Diseases."" It’s published by the World Health Organization , then adapted for use in the United States.
The United States now uses ICD-9, which is more than three decades old.
Doctors’ offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them.
The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it’ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch.
Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether.
Other countries have charged ahead.
They started to adopt the ""new"" set of codes nearly 20 years ago, and most developed countries now use it, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
CMS will require American doctors, indeed, any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch by Oct. 1, 2014.
The federal government says the United States needs to upgrade partly because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing.
Claims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldn’t specify right vs. left hand , for example.
As Poe suggested, the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s — 68,000 instead of 13,000.
(Poe, in his Stossel interview, said the new system has 140,000 codes, but that’s only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes — not a direct comparison with 13,000.)
How much detail are we talking?
The codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys, but from parrots, macaws, ducks and geese.
There’s a different code for being ""struck"" vs. ""pecked"" or suffering from ""other contact""— with specification for the first time, an unlucky repeat or even worse, "" sequela ."" (That would be some ""negative afteraffect"" resulting from your turkey encounter. Headaches! Panic attacks!)
Poe’s office pointed us to this:
W61.4 Contact with turkey
W61.42 Struck by turkey
W61.42XA initial encounter
W61.42XD subsequent encounter
W61.42XS sequela
W61.43 Pecked by turkey
W61.43XA initial encounter
W61.43XD subsequent encounter
W61.43XS sequela
W61.49 Other contact with turkey
W61.49XA initial encounter
W61.49XD subsequent encounter
W61.49XS sequela
If you’ve seen TV ads about the need to prepare for a bright new career in medical billing and coding — this is part of the reason why.",1,Ted Poe
"""More than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was implemented, at a cost of over $360 million. Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand, such as translators, engineers, and pilots."" The Democratic Party's draft platform , entitled Renewing America's Promise, promises to repeal the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy.
That policy grew out of a furious political battle in the early days of President Bill Clinton's administration, when he considered lifting the Pentagon's longstanding ban on gays in the military. Under a compromise that took effect in 1994, the military would not ask about servicemembers' sexual orientation, and gay persons could serve as long as they were silent about that aspect of their lives.
The DNC platform says ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" wastes money and disqualifies valuable personnel. Under the heading, ""Allow All Americans to Serve,"" the platform says:
""We will also put national security above divisive politics. More than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy was implemented, at a cost of over $360 million. Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand, such as translators, engineers, and pilots. At a time when the military is having a tough time recruiting and retaining troops, it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave, qualified people. We support the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation.""
Since the DNC justified its position with statistics, we want to see if those statistics hold up.
The claim that ""more than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy was implemented"" seems to be accurate. The Pentagon was unable to provide us promptly with its count, but a February 2005 Government Accountability Office report said 9,488 servicemembers had been ousted for homosexual conduct between the start of the policy in 1994 and the end of fiscal year 2003.
When we asked the Democratic National Committee where the number came from, they referred us to the Obama campaign, which in turn sent us to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy group for gay servicemembers. The group's spokesman, Adam Ebbins, said it files Freedom of Information Act requests each year to get the most recent number, and that the last count, as of the end of fiscal year 2007, was 12,342 members discharged, with no response from the Coast Guard.
""At this point we are confident that the number of discharges has exceeded 12,500,"" Ebbins said.
He said the military documents supporting that number were too cumbersome to provide promptly, but by our count the GAO report suggests a discharge rate of 2.6 service members per day, which would place the current total well over 12,000. So the defense network's number is quite plausible, and we see no reason to question it.
Onto the DNC's claim that ""many of those forced out had special skills in high demand."" The GAO report said 757 of those discharged for homosexuality, or 8 percent, held ""critical occupations,"" meaning jobs worthy of selective reenlistment bonuses, and of those 322 had some skills in important foreign languages such as Arabic, Farsi or Korean. So yes, that qualifies as ""many,"" and the claim was accurate.
The third aspect of the party's claim – that the policy cost more than $360 million – is less clear. It seems odd to us that a debate of this sort would bog down over money; we suspect those who feel strongly on either side of this debate believe it should be decided on issues such as equality or military readiness, not cost. Nevertheless, volumes have been written on the cost of the policy, so let's have at it.
In its 2005 report, the GAO said that over the 10-year period it ""could have cost"" the Department of Defense $190.5 million to recruit and train replacements for servicemembers lost due to the policy. But the office cautioned that ""the total costs of DOD's homosexual conduct policy cannot be estimated because DOD does not collect relevant cost data on inquiries and investigations, counseling and pastoral care, separation functions, and discharge reviews.""
A year later the Michael D. Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote a competing financial Analysis of ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" , and concluded that the policy cost at least $363.8 million between 1994 and 2003. The DNC used that number.
The California commission comprised former Secretary of Defense William Perry, a former assistant defense secretary, two former military officers, a military law expert, and six professors (including two from West Point and two from the Naval Postgraduate School). It had its research design and report reviewed and vetted by Mary Malina, a professor at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate school, and an expert in cost accounting, management control systems and managerial accounting practice.
The commission found that the GAO overestimated one aspect of the cost of the policy – adding the cost of replacing those fired for being gay but failing to offset that with the value recovered through the time served by the replacement.
In two other respects, though, the GAO underestimated the cost, the commission found. It did not include the cost of training officers who were discharged for homosexuality, and for enlistees, it used an inaccurate estimate of training costs per person.
Bottom line: the California commission came up with a cost 91 percent higher than the GAO's.
The GAO fired back, critiquing the commission's report in July 2006. It said 90 percent of the gap between its estimate and the commission's was due to differing estimates of enlistee training costs.
""Our estimate focused largely on the direct and incremental training costs associated with the specific occupations of servicemembers,"" the GAO wrote. ""The Commission based its estimate on average training costs for all occupations indexed for inflation.""
The office defended its estimated in other respects as well, and stood by its number.
The California commission chair, University of California associate political science professor Aaron Belkin, answered back in September 2006 with a critique of the GAO's critique of his critique of their report. Still with us? Belkin said that in its defense of its estimate the GAO did not ""acknowledge the implications of its failure to obtain length-of-training data"" and ""misrepresents its own training cost data.""
We're getting way into the weeds here, and as Belkin said in an interview, ""With any accounting story you have multiple truths because accounting can be calculated in different ways.""
That said, two factors compel us to approve of the DNC's claim that the policy has cost over $360 million. For one thing, both the GAO and the California estimates are now five years out of date, and even the GAO's methodology would yield an estimate much higher than $190 million today – it might well even reach $360 million.
Secondly, the GAO acknowledged in its 2005 report that it was not trying to provide a complete estimate – in fact, the title of its report was ""Financial Costs and Loss of Critical Skills Due to DOD's Homosexual Conduct Policy Cannot Be Completely Estimated."" The California commission did endeavor to provide a complete estimate, and it drew on extensive expertise to do so. Therefore, its estimate is the best available measure of the cost of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""",1,Democratic National Committee
"""John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq."" Two new videos — a TV ad from a veterans group and a parody of a popular YouTube video — quote John McCain as saying the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years.
""John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq,"" Rose Forrest, an Iraq war veteran, says in an ad for VoteVets.org that aired in Washington, D.C., in late February and is still available on the Web. ""That's some commitment to the Iraqi people, Sen. McCain.""
A YouTube video known as ""John He Is"" uses humor to make the same point. It spoofs a pro-Obama music video called Yes We Can . The parody has grainy footage of McCain saying, ""I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years"" and ends with these words on the screen: ""IRAQ WITHDRAWAL DATE: 12,008 . . . . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT IN NOVEMBER."" (We're not putting the parody to the Truth-O-Meter, but it's worth checking out for a funny perspective on McCain's comments.)
Sen. Barack Obama made a similar charge (but without the catchy music) during the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, when he said, ""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.""
The videos and Obama's statement made us wonder about the full context of McCain's remarks and whether the comments were portrayed accurately. We've previously addressed Sen. Hillary Clinton's claim about the 100-year remark with this item, but McCain has elaborated since then.
It's well known that McCain has been a strong supporter of the Iraq war, even when his position harmed his presidential campaign. At a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Jan. 3, 2008, McCain was glib about the need for a long-term U.S. commitment:
QUESTION: ""President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — ""
McCAIN: ""Make it a hundred.""
Q: ""Is that — ""
McCAIN: ""We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al-Qaida is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day.""
Three days later, he was asked about the remark on CBS's Face the Nation. He likened the future U.S. role in Iraq to other nations where the United States has a military presence:
""My point was and continues to be, how long do we have to stay in Bosnia? How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those, 50-, 60-year period. No one complains. In fact, they contribute enormously, their presence, to stability in the world,"" McCain said.
""The point is, it's American casualties. We've got to get Americans off the front line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine.""
When McCain was asked about the remark Jan. 9 on ABC's Good Morning America, he said the U.S. presence could last 1-million years:
""Could be 1,000 years or a million years,"" he said. ""We have bases in Kuwait right now. We have bases in South Korea and Japan, Germany. I mean (the allegation by critics is) a straw man. It's a fallacious argument by people who don't understand that it's not American presence, it's American casualties. If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them, Americans are not concerned — in fact, they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait.""
The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years (or a million). But once combat ends and U.S. casualities dwindle, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany. That presence could continue for many years.
Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying ""Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years."" We gave that a True.
But Obama twisted McCain's words in the Cleveland debate. He said, ""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.""
As we explain above, McCain was referring to a peacetime presence, not the war. So we find Obama's statement False.
VoteVets is a veterans group that opposes the Bush administration policy in Iraq and is backing nine Democratic congressional candidates who are veterans. VoteVets has joined a coalition of liberal-leaning groups such as MoveOn.org that will be running ads against McCain.
The VoteVets ad does not make the mistake Obama does. It says, ""John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq.",1,VoteVets.org
"The Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about cancellation of major missile-defense facilities ""at the last minute in midnight phone calls."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney made news on Oct. 21, 2009, when he accused the White House of ""dithering while America's armed forces are in danger"" in Afghanistan. That was just one of many fireballs he lobbed at the Obama administration’s policies on Iran, Iraq and the interrogation of suspected terrorists.
Cheney also rapped the White House for sloppy diplomacy in its decision to cancel a planned missile-defense radar in the Czech Republic and planned missile interceptors in Poland. The administration decided that the facilities were designed with a less-severe threat – long range missiles – in mind, and that missile-defense efforts should instead be focused on countering short- and medium-range missiles.
Work on the missile-defense facilities – which had prompted strenuous opposition from Russia and mixed feelings by residents of the two Eastern European countries – was conceived during the tenure of Cheney and President George W. Bush. So Cheney’s opposition to Obama’s canceling the project was not surprising.
However, in his speech, Cheney went beyond the substance of the decision and accused the White House of bumbling diplomatic protocol in making its announcement.
""It is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls,"" Cheney told an awards dinner sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a conservative group. ""It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic. Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved, just like that – with apparently little, if any, consultation. Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland, it was an odd way to mark the occasion.""
In this item, we will try to determine the timing of when the Obama administration told the Czech Republic and Poland of the decision.
According to many news accounts, Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer was indeed told shortly after midnight, Warsaw time, on Thursday, Sept. 17, 2009. (That is, indeed, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion.)
""Just after midnight I was informed,"" Fischer said, according to the
Independent
, a British newspaper. The Russian newspaper
Vremya Novostey
pinpointed the call to 12:21 in the morning.
A call received at 12:21 a.m. in Warsaw would have been placed six hours earlier – 6:21 p.m. in Washington.
News of the decision began to leak out the following morning, Washington time. CNN, for example, reported the decision in its 9 a.m. block of
CNN Newsroom
. Obama announced it at 10:21 a.m. in a brief address in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room.
So, the time between Obama’s call to Fischer and the formal White House announcement was about 16 hours, most of which was nighttime in one country or the other.
Pinning down the time that Obama contacted Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a little trickier.
According to Agence France Presse
,
the Czech leader said that Poland ""had been informed in the same way"" as he himself had been. But the Russian paper,
Vremya Novostey
, citing ""Polish news media reports,"" said that a ""technical"" glitch prevented Obama from speaking to Tusk late Wednesday night, so the conversation ""took place only [on Thursday] afternoon."" (We presume that is Warsaw time.)
If Obama did finally make personal contact with Tusk that late, it still would have been before the formal White House announcement, though barely.
The White House declined to provide additional details about the timing.
By way of context, it’s worth noting that the announcement was not exactly a surprise.
After Obama's announcement, Fischer himself said that ""we knew the United States was reviewing its plan to build the radar ... within a reassessment of specific threats, and that one option might be to give up the plan to build the radar,"" according to Agence France Presse
.
""The threats now rest in short- and medium-range missiles, not long-range ones. The American side decided this was the most serious threat and this is their reaction.""
It's not clear why the White House chose to make the announcement when it did. Obama still had six days left if he wanted to get the news out before world leaders arrived in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.
Asked by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, at a Senate Armed Services hearing whether the announcement could have been handled any better, undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy blamed leak-fueled speculation.
''We too would have preferred a longer period for consultation and rollout, but leaks and speculation in the press sort of forced us to go sooner to set the record straight,'' she said.
As for Cheney's statement, he's definitely right about Fischer, the Czech leader, being contacted about midnight. And although there is a discrepency about the time of the final notification for Poland, the reports indicate that Obama first tried about midnight.",1,Dick Cheney
"""We could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-ups."" UPDATED.
This item has been updated, but our ruling didn't change. See below.
Sen. Barack Obama injected a startling claim into the debate on energy, asserting in a Missouri town hall meeting that the country could save more gas from inflating its tires and tuning up its cars than would be gained from drilling more off its coasts.
""There are things that you can do individually, though, to save energy,"" Obama said in the July 30, 2008, appearance. ""Making sure your tires are properly inflated — simple thing. But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires, and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much.""
Sen. John McCain and his allies — who advocate lifting the federal moratorium that bans drilling in some areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the U.S. coasts — immediately mocked Obama for the claim. The McCain campaign even offered to send ""Obama Energy Plan"" tire gauges to anyone who sent in a donation of $25 or more.
The McCain campaign's assumption seemed to be that Obama's claim was utterly implausible. And, we admit, it kind of sounds that way. But is it?
Under-inflated tires — to say nothing of poorly tuned cars — are actually a serious problem, as government agencies, industry groups, conservationists and outside experts have been saying for years. (The Obama campaign even cited a number of instances when prominent McCain supporters echoed the call for more public awareness about tire inflation.)
""A lot of people are driving around on severely under-inflated tires,"" said Robert Sinclair, Jr., a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. ""Try riding a bicycle with under-inflated tires. It's hard for the human engine to push it ahead. Pump it up, it seems like you're gliding on air.""
The same thing happens with a car. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by .4 percent for every 1 pounds-per-square-inch drop in tire pressure, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The best estimate available, by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is that at least a quarter of drivers are cruising around on under-inflated tires. In April, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the Auto Club, the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company used those statistics, along with Department of Transportation and Automobile Association of America data, to extrapolate that 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost every year due to under-inflation of tires.
That's an estimate, to be sure, and not one from a published, peer-reviewed study. But remember, Obama said we ""could"" save all the oil available from offshore drilling in the protected areas — not we ""would"" — so if the claim is merely plausible he's on solid ground.
So how much oil is available offshore? According to the latest assessment from the Minerals Management Service, the mean estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf areas that are currently under moratorium is about 18-billion barrels (see here .)
But it couldn't all be extracted immediately. The agency estimates that if the moratorium were lifted production could start by 2017, and by 2030, oil companies could be producing 2.4-million barrels of oil instead of 2.2-million. That's 200,000 more barrels per day.
After refining, a barrel of oil can produce up to 19.5 gallons of gasoline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. So that's 3.9-million more gallons of gasoline per day, or 1.4-billion gallons of gasoline per year.
And remember, an estimated 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost annually due to under-inflated tires.
And we didn't even talk about tune-ups. (Repairing a car that is noticeably out of tune or has failed an emissions test improves gas mileage by 4 percent on average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fixing a more serious problem, such as a bad oxygen sensor, can improve mileage by up to 40 percent, the agency says.)
All of the numbers in this analysis are estimates, we should emphasize. Oil industry experts told us estimates of the amount of oil offshore and how fast it could be extracted vary widely, and the Energy Information Administration's number is fairly optimistic. Likewise, it's highly unlikely any public awareness effort could change behavior enough to save 2.8-billion gallons of gasoline per day.
For these reasons, we ruled this claim to be True.
Update:
After we published this item, McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb called to dispute it, citing a Government Accountability Office letter of Feb. 9, 2007 that says tire inflation wastes 1.2 billion gallons of gasoline instead of the 2.8 billion estimate we used.
The letter says: ""The Department of Energy's designated economist on this issue indicated that, of the 130 billion gallons of fuel that the Transportation Research Board estimated were used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005, about 1.2 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on under-inflated tires.""
That estimate falls just under the estimated 1.4 billion gallons a year from increased offshore drilling.
But that doesn't persuade us to change our ruling, for three reasons. First, 1.2 billion gallons in possible savings from proper tire inflation is still in the ballpark of the 1.4 billion gallons from drilling. Given that all of these numbers are estimates, it's hard to say the difference between these two numbers constitutes a falsehood.
Second, it would take years of work to start producing 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline from oil pumped offshore -- the Energy Information Administration estimate contemplates production beginning in 2017. And the oil reserves would not be bottomless. Conceivably, the savings from tire-pressure correction could begin immediately and last indefinitely, thus easily overcoming the marginal difference in the estimates provided by the McCain campaign.
And finally, none of this takes into account the impact of tune-ups, which Obama mentioned as part of his claim. If Department of Energy estimates of 4 percent mileage improvement for better-tuned cars are true, that alone would push the total savings above the estimated drilling yield.
Goldfarb also pointed out that barrels of oil, in addition to yielding 19.5 gallons of gasoline, yield other products as well, such as jet fuel, lubricants and feed stocks. Point taken, but Obama's statement was made within the context of the current drilling debate, which has been about increasing the supply of domestic oil to ease the strain on the U.S. transportation sector.
In the end, estimates are all we have to work with here. Estimates of oil production, estimates of gasoline savings. For our purposes in evaluating Obama's claim, all the available evidence shows that he's on solid ground in saying that better car and tire maintenance would save as much gasoline as drilling would generate. We appreciate McCain's campaign pointing out a GAO source we'd missed in our original research, but it's not at odds with our original ruling, True.",1,Barack Obama
"""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.'"" On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others.
""There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe,"" Hannity said.
""Now, this is a terrorist act,"" Hannity said. ""What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?""
""Here's the point,"" Hannity said, ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.""
We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the ""global war on terrorism"" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.
We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times.
So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.
The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.""
Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.
""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.
""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.""
The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:
Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?""
Obama: ""Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.""
Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?""
Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.""
So Obama isn't fond of the phrase ""war on terror."" But did that ever become blanket White House policy?
According to a
Washington Post
story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said ""this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or ""Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' "" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.
Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the
Washington Post
there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of ""a career civil servant.""
Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term ""war on terror,"" or the like, very often.
Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words ""terror"" or ""terrorism"" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.
The absence of those words ""goes to the heart"" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009.
""As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida’s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.""
Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. ""President Obama has articulated a clear policy — to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies,"" Brennan said. ""That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.""
Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the ""war on terror."" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism."" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase ""war on terror,"" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase ""war on terrorism.",1,Sean Hannity
"Says Warren Buffett has publicly said his secretary ""should not be paying a higher tax rate"" than him. During the second presidential debate, Hillary Clinton argued against tax rules that allow the ultra-rich to pay lower rates than the middle class. She said she would change them as president, a move that has become known as the ""Buffett rule.""
""Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary,"" Clinton said.
Warren Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Forbes estimates him to be worth $64.3 billion and one of the richest men in the world. He is also a Hillary Clinton supporter and has sparred with Donald Trump over Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns.
Urging major tax changes, Buffett has repeatedly said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary and other employees.
In 2007 , Buffett told NBC Nightly News that he pays a smaller tax rate than multiple employees in his office.
In 2011, Buffett wrote an op-ed in the New York Times called ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" In the article, Buffett said that his taxes amounted to ""only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office.""
In 2013, he told CNBC that while his tax rate rose 8 to 9 points more that year, ""The differential between me and the rest of the office, not just my secretary but the rest of the office, was greater than that. It'll be closer, but I'll probably be the lowest-paying taxpayer in the office.""
A quick phone call to Buffett’s office confirmed this fact-check. Buffett’s assistant Debbie Bosanek -- the secretary Buffett mentions -- confirmed her boss pays a lower tax rate than she does.
So, how can this be?
Buffett’s op-ed says his tax rate is lower than his employees’ because money made off investments is taxed at a lower rate than wage income
""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett said.
Personal income is taxed based on how much a person makes each year. In 2016, the brackets range from 10 percent for those making $9,275 or less, to a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent for those making $415,051 or more. Meanwhile, the tax rate on long-term capital gains -- the profits from investments -- is 15 percent. However, if the taxpayer's taxable income is greater than $415,051, their long term capital gains are taxed at 20 percent.
Here are the current rates for a single taxpayer.
On Oct. 10, 2016, Buffett released details about his personal tax data in a statement titled, ""Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump."" He says he paid $1.85 million in federal taxes in 2015, and his adjusted gross income was $11.6 million. That means he paid 15.9 percent in effective federal income tax.
Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor, said in an email most taxpayers with incomes in the low six figures have a higher rate than 16 percent.
""That's true even if you consider only federal income tax. Add in payroll tax and Buffet's rate becomes even lower compared with his secretary,"" he said.
Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes, and are deducted by your employer before you get your paycheck. These taxes pay for Medicare and Social Security. The employee tax rate for Social Security is typically 6.2 percent of your gross income, up to $113,700, and 1.45 percent on all income for Medicare.
These two rates are not progressive or applied to all income, so as income increases, they make up a smaller percentage of the total income.
Since Buffett makes the majority of his money from investments, his wage income -- and therefore his payroll taxes -- are low. But those who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. We don’t know what salary Buffett’s secretary earns, but it’s likely much higher than the median pay for secretaries. (Remember that Buffett is one of the richest men in the world.)
A study from the nonpartisan The Tax Policy Center says that people making between $100,000 and $200,000 pay an average 19.6 percent in taxes, including payroll and income taxes.",1,Hillary Clinton
"In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, ""hands or feet"" or ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White House’s efforts to advance new restrictions on guns.
One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others we’ve received. It says, ""Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?""
We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered ""an assault weapon. "" For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obama’s intention to ""ban semi-automatic rifles,"" California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of ""assault weapon.""
That said, we’ll take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBI’s annual ""Crime in the United States"" report . The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available:
The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook post’s number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate.
The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While it’s true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by ""other guns."" If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323.
Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle.
We should note that while the Facebook post’s comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.
This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate.",1,Facebook posts
"""Hurricane Irma could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast."" A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn’t even exist.
The web post appeared as Hurricane Irma was powering through the Caribbean, days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in Florida. The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour.
Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it’s not) posting a page headlined, ""HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast.""
The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, ""The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory.""
A flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of Irma becoming a Category 6 storm.
There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5.
Why we use the current scale
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage.
""Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds,"" wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth .
As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path.
""Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ "" Williams wrote. ""After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today.""
While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson’s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975 , amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric.
Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. ""Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage,"" according to the National Hurricane Center . ""Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures.""
The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows:
The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010 , the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge.
Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5 , the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated.
Should there be a Category 6?
From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology.
A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models.
The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however.
The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures.
""Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,"" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met.""
Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact.
And the scale’s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, ""it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. … That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway.""
In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements.
""I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,"" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, ""did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm.""
Similarly, ""much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,"" Bell said. ""These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential.""
Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. ""Irma is a beast,"" she said. ""It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it.""
So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates Pants on Fire.",0,Bloggers
"""In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence."" In his effort to pass a health care overhaul, President Barack Obama has enlisted help from a close ally — his wife, Michelle.
On Sept. 18, 2009, the first lady gave a speech about the importance of health care reform to women, and cited several reasons she thinks the current system is gender-biased.
This line caught our attention:
""Women are affected because, as we heard, in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender,"" she said. ""And this is still shocking to me. These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night. ... In some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence.""
Health reform bills under consideration by Congress would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-exisiting conditions, an issue we've already explored ; we've also examined how pregnancy can sometimes be a basis to deny coverage, and how pre-exisiting conditions already lead to health care rationing by private health insurers.
But we'd never heard domestic abuse could count as a pre-existing condition, so we decided to look into the claim.
The issue first came to light in 1994, when a Pennsylvania woman was denied health, life and mortgage disability insurance because of domestic violence, according to the Women's Law Project. That group, along with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, began advocating for legislation to expressly prohibit the practice. Since then, most states, including Pennsylvania, have adopted laws prohibiting the practice.
But, as Mrs. Obama said in her speech, denying coverage due to a history of domestic abuse is still legal in some states. Those states are Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, according to the National Women's Law Center.
The claim has become a popular talking point for groups supporting health care reform such as the Service Employees International Union. (It's been discussed so much recently that Arkansas, which had no prohibition, this year passed a law prohibiting discrimination against domestic violence victims.) A Huffington Post story about the laws last week prompted several states and insurance companies to say that the laws have been changed or that the companies don't treat domestic violence as a pre-existing condition.
The North Carolina situation is a matter of some disagreement. Although the Women's Law Center says the practice is still allowed, state officials say they interpret the laws to mean it is not.
Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told the
Jackson Free Press
that he wanted to explore whether insurance companies were taking advantage of the law:
""I've got to get some of my lawyers to do some research on this, but we have only six mandated (conditions that must be covered) in our state statues, and we have 25 or more optional coverages, but domestic abuse doesn't seem to be one of them. ... The whole situation is bad. Let's say a woman works with a company that had Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and she gets beat up in her house and Blue Cross says 'we're not covering you because getting beat up is your pre-existing condition.' That's terrible.""
Meanwhile, Wyoming Department of Insurance staff attorney James Mitchell told the
Huffington Post
that state law does not expressly prohibit insurers from using domestic abuse as grounds to deny coverage, though he'd found no cases of the practice in his state.
Mitchell's response raises an important point: Just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean that insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole.
Back in the 1990s there was evidence that the practice was widespread. In 1994, a House Judiciary Committee panel conducted an informal survey and found that eight of the 16 largest insurers in the country used domestic violence as a factor in deciding coverage. And a year later, the Insurance Commission of Pennsylvania reported that a formal survey showed that 24 percent of accident, health and life insurers took domestic violence into account when deciding whether to issue and renew insurance policies.
But that data is more than 10 years old, so we asked Lisa Codispoti, senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center, if insurance companies are still denying health care coverage based on domestic violence history.
Examples are hard to come by, she said, because people who get coverage through an employer don't usually face exclusions about pre-existing condititions. Only people who apply for individual coverage would, she said.
""It's such a small number of people who apply for individual insurance,"" she said. ""And it's not like insurance companies have to tell you why you're being denied coverage.""
Indeed, underwriting standards are private, said Nancy Durborow, health projects coordinator for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, making it difficult for groups such as hers to find out how widespread the practice still is.
""This is very secretive stuff,"" she said.
A spokesman for the association representing insurance companies told us he's not aware of any insurers that deny women coverage based on history of domestic abuse. And the group supports a proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that would fully prohibit the practice.
""No one should be denied coverage because they are victims of domestic abuse,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans.
We find that the first lady is correct that ""in some states, it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because she's been the victim of domestic violence."" Putting aside the disputed North Carolina law, there still are several other states — including Mississippi and Wyoming — that  have no specific laws prohibiting the practice. It's important to note that we couldn't find this was happening on a widespread basis — or even just a little bit. But still, Mrs.",1,Michelle Obama
"Says Sen. Mitch McConnell is ""the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle."" Republicans are hopeful they can win enough Senate seats in November to take control of the chamber, which puts Sen. Mitch McConnell in the driver’s seat to become majority leader next year.
But first, the Kentucky Republican needs to get through a tough re-election campaign.
Both Republican primary challenger Matt Bevin and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have sought to paint McConnell as a Washington insider after three decades in the Senate.
Along those lines, in an email to her supporters on March 17, 2014, Lundergan Grimes claimed that McConnell is ""the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle.""
There’s going to be a lot of mudslinging in this race and a lot of claims about who is raising money from whom and where. We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress.
Campaigns and candidates use ""lobbyists"" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, ""what exactly is a lobbyist?"" Glad you asked.
Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics.
We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They linked us to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The report, titled ""Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big,"" looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists. If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress, they’re required to register with the federal government. Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file.
Open Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated $1.9 million. Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both.
Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013).
With $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380. McConnell has also received another $50,000 from family members of lobbyists.
Here’s the top 10:
As you can see, it’s a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list, but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way, by quite a bit.
This list doesn’t count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry, won by Democrat Ed Markey. Markey raised about $306,000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey’s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle.
McConnell isn’t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists. According to his Open Secrets profile , he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries.
He’s No. 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of — deep breath here — agriculture services, air transportation, auto dealers and manufacturers, building materials, business associations, coal mining, commercial banks, commercial TV and radio stations, electric utilities, food and beverage, food stores, general contractors, health services, home builders, insurance, medical devices and supplies, mining, mortgage bankers and brokers, pharmaceutical and health products, railroads, retirees, steel production and trucking.
When he last ran for re-election in 2008 , McConnell, who was minority leader at the time, topped the list in two industries, coal mining and tobacco. He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists.
It’s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well.

"""Putting three Republicans in my Cabinet...is unprecedented."" UPDATE: This claim was accurate when President Obama said it. As you can see below in the original item, it is indeed unprecedented to have three Cabinet members from the opposite party. The circumstances changed on Feb. 12, 2009, three days after Obama's statement, when Sen. Gregg withdrew . But because we rule on statements based on the wording and timing of statements, we're keeping this one as a True. Obama was correct when he said it on Feb. 9, for the way he said it.
So far, the votes on the massive economic stimulus package have fallen starkly along partisan lines. The bill that passed the House didn't get a single Republican vote, and the version that passed the Senate got a grand total of three.
During a news conference on Feb. 9, 2009, in which President Obama made his case for the stimulus plan, he was asked if pressing forward despite Republican objections meant the White House is moving away from its emphasis on bipartisanship.
""You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans — going over to meet with both Republican caucuses; you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented; making sure that they were invited here to the White House to talk about the economic recovery plan — all those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes,"" Obama said. ""They were designed to try to build up some trust over time.  And I think that as I continue to make these overtures, over time hopefully that will be reciprocated.""
We decided to check out whether Obama can accurately claim that his three Republican Cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan high-water mark in presidential history.
For starters, we're going to give Obama three Republicans, though a stickler could point out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates isn't actually registered as a Republican. But he's Republican enough in our book. Gates has served under several Republican administrations, and though he dropped his party registration to present an apolitical appearance while with the CIA, Gates himself said in December, ""I consider myself a Republican.""
The other two Obama appointees are card-carrying Republicans: Ray LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, as secretary of transportation; and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce secretary (though he has not yet been confirmed).
And Obama is right. No other president has had this many.
For a little perspective, here's a rundown of the crossovers from a century's worth of presidential Cabinets:
• George W. Bush: Democrat Norman Mineta, transportation secretary.
• Bill Clinton: Republican William Cohen, defense secretary.
• George H. W. Bush: nada.
• Ronald Reagan: William Bennett was a Democrat when appointed as education secretary in 1985, but the following year, he became a Republican and has remained a conservative Republican voice ever since.
• Jimmy Carter: Republican James Schlesinger, who served as defense secretary under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was tapped by Carter as America's first energy secretary.
• Richard Nixon: Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as ambassador to the United Nations, which at the time was not a Cabinet-level position.
• John F. Kennedy: Republicans C. Douglas Dillon as treasury secretary and Robert McNamara as defense secretary. McNamara wasn't such a stretch though, as
Time m
agazine pointed out at the time, ""In politics, McNamara is a lukewarm, liberal Republican who often contributes to Democratic candidates. This year he voted for Kennedy.""
• Dwight D. Eisenhower: Democrat and Labor Secretary Martin Patrick Durkin, the ""plumber"" among Eisenhower's so called ""Nine Millionaires and a Plumber"" Cabinet. Durkin was replaced in 1953 by fellow Democrat James P. Mitchell, a so-called ""Democrat-for-Eisenhower.""
• Franklin D. Roosevelt: Republicans Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy and Henry Stimson, secretary of war.
""Nobody's got three,"" said presidential historian Richard Shenkman. ""This is unprecedented.""
Shenkman doesn't think you'll be hearing much from the secretaries of transportation or commerce any time soon — those Cabinet secretaries typically take a lower profile — but the appointment of Gates, he said, is ""highly significant.""
""I wouldn't call it tokenism,"" Shenkman said. ""I think it's real. He (Obama) is making some kind of an effort there. And it comes at very little cost. It's a shrewd political move.""
But Terry Sullivan, associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called the Obama appointments little more than political symbolism.
""The real question is not whether it's true or false (that Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of Republicans), but what it means,"" Sullivan said.  ""I don't know what having a bipartisan Cabinet gets you. I don't see that it gets you anything.""
Yes, he said, it may mean a few Cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred.
""I'm suggesting this is a very sophisticated political community,"" Sullivan said. It'd be one thing if Obama had appointed the Republican leader of the Senate to a high-level Cabinet position. That might move things toward some sort of reconciliation government, he said. ""But governing is way more sophisticated than these symbolic gestures.""
Whatever you make of the appointments, Obama is on solid ground when he said his three Republican Cabinet appointments were unprecedented.",1,Barack Obama
"Says ""Obama paid FBI informant over $1 million to do it to Trump."" As President Donald Trump tweeted that the Russia investigation is fake news, USbreakingnews.net flashed the headline, "" BOMBSHELL!! Obama Paid FBI Informant Over $1 MILLION To Do It To Trump! ""
Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .
Is it true?
No.
The facts behind this claim
The FBI informant in question has been reported by the Washington Post and others as American foreign policy academic Stefan Halper. According to news reports , the FBI asked Halper to talk to several people involved with the Trump campaign during the summer and fall of 2016. Halper had conversations with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, then foreign policy advisers to the Trump campaign, and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis.
Early on in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians in 2016.
Trump has said the informant got a ""massive amount of money,"" but we don’t know if the FBI paid him at all. It’s simply unknown at this point.
Where is the money coming from?
Here’s what the USbreakingnews story got right: Halper received over $1 million to do work for the U.S. government. Washington’s spending database shows the government signed four contracts with Halper totalling $1,058,161 between 2012 and 2016. The dates fall during the Obama administration.
In the key period in 2016 , Halper worked on a study of Russian-Chinese relationships.
But the money came from the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment, not the FBI. The Pentagon describes the Office of Net Assessment as ""an independent organization within the Department of Defense charged with identifying emerging or future threats and opportunities for the United States.""
The USbreakingnews piece gets a bit confused on this point. It asks, ""Why would anyone receive that kind of money ($1,058,161) from the DOJ?"" But the money did not come from the Department of Justice, where the FBI sits. It came from the Pentagon.
The article then asks why ""someone like Halper"" would get such money. Halper’s professional biography gives a few answers. He’s professor emeritus at Cambridge University in England where he lectures on international security issues. He served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Political-Military Affairs in the Reagan administration.
The headline says Obama had a direct hand in the payments, but it offers no evidence that Obama had anything to do with the contract awards.
Some money came before Trump announced he was running
The article’s math is also off.
About 40 percent of the money was awarded before Trump even got into the race in June 2015. So even if there were a tie between the contracts and Halper’s conversations with Trump campaign advisers – and there’s zero indication of that —  the amount would be less than $1 million.
The article strings together a handful of facts to gin up a compelling headline, but nothing holds together.",0,Bloggers
"""This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time."" Policymakers and pundits are spending a lot of time these days talking about part-time jobs -- whether they are becoming more common at the expense of full-time jobs, and how problematic that trend could be.
Republicans note that President Barack Obama’s health care law requires larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers, which they say gives companies an incentive to cut workers’ hours so much that they become part-time workers and thus exempt from the health insurance mandate.
And beyond the question of Obamacare’s incentives, some economists worry that since the most recent recession, companies have been unusually willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers.
We recently noticed two seemingly contradictory comments on this topic -- one from a Republican, one from a Democrat -- and thought it would be worthwhile checking both.
In this item, we will check a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a response to one of Obama’s Saturday radio addresses .
""In the past, most new jobs were full time, but, this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time,"" Collins said. ""Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced. Jobs will be lost. This is especially disturbing as our country is still battling high unemployment.""
The other comment we will check separately is by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers: ""Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.""
These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
For Collins, we looked at the change in full-time and part-time employment between December 2012 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary:
So Collins has a point -- 77 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from part-time jobs. We think a 3-to-1 ratio qualifies as ""overwhelming.""
Still, we will offer a few caveats.
• A large majority of these jobs are being taken by people who want to work part time. BLS breaks part-time jobs into two categories -- people working part-time for economic reasons (meaning they want a full-time job, but have to settle for a part-time job), and people working part-time for noneconomic reasons (because they prefer a part-time schedule to a full-time schedule).
In other words, about 70 percent of people working part time right now are doing so because they want to work part time, not because the economy is forcing them to.
This doesn’t mean there are no problems associated with a rise in part-time jobs -- such a shift could make it harder for the recovery to gain momentum, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Still, it’s important to point out that most people taking part-time jobs aren’t being forced into those jobs purely because of the economy.
• Timing matters. If you use a longer time horizon, a large percentage of jobs created were full-time positions. ""Over longer periods, a much smaller percentage of job gains have taken the form of part-time jobs,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.
In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument.",1,Susan Collins
"McCain tells of a fellow Vietnam POW who was beaten for fashioning an American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs. A chain e-mail making the rounds recounts a moving anecdote Sen. John McCain has related about a fellow Vietnam prisoner of war who was severely beaten by guards for fashioning a makeshift American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs.
The e-mail message encourages those who receive the e-mail to ""pass this on... and on... and on!""
And it leaves little doubt about its political intent, as it closes with the line, ""oh...and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge. ...""
This is an obvious, and misguided, swipe at Sen. Barack Obama, who has frequently been attacked in chain e-mails for allegedly refusing to place his hand on his heart when saying the Pledge of Allegiance. We at PolitiFact already debunked that myth.
But here we will check the accuracy of McCain's POW anecdote, which was forwarded to us by several PolitiFact readers.
Here's how the chain e-mail reads, in part:
""One of the men who moved into my (POW) room was a young man named Mike Christian. ... Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.
""Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
""I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event.
""One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it.
""That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could.
""The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room.
""As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our flag and country.
""So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country.""
McCain relates this same anecdote in his book, Faith of My Fathers, in nearly identical fashion.
And the story is backed up by another POW, Leo K. Thorsness, albeit with a couple small differences in detail.
Thorsness was an Air Force fighter pilot who was shot down on his 93rd mission and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi.
When people ask if he lived with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton, Thorsness likes to correct: ""John lived with me. I got there first.""
Thorsness, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in the Vietnam War, recalled to PolitiFact ""the day when Mike Christian found this slimy old rag, an old dirty handkerchief"" while in the yard outside the cell.
Thorsness said Christian spent days cleaning up the handkerchief, and used blue ink and ground up red roof tiles for color. Then, he took threads from his blanket and sewed on stars with a bamboo needle.
It took a good bit of imagination to make out that it was an American flag, Thorsness said, ""but we all knew what it was."" When Christian finished the flag and showed it to his fellow POWs, Thorsness said, ""I think every one of us snapped to attention.""
It was a tough group of men, he said, and yet there were very few dry eyes.
Sometimes, he said, it was hung up on a cell wall and men would salute it and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
""To everyone there, it was very meaningful,"" he said.
Christian knew full well that he would eventually be caught and punished, Thorsness said. Christian hid the makeshift flag in an extra sleeve of his pajamas. But it was discovered by the guards and confiscated during a surprise inspection.
That night, the guards came for Christian, Thorsness said, and ""they beat him mercilessly through most of the night. They beat the hell out of him. But Mike was one tough guy.""
And soon after, Thorsness said, Christian was back at it again making another flag.
""Anyone who witnessed that was moved,"" Thorsness said. ""It made a lasting impression.""
Christian died in a Virginia home fire in 1983.
Thorsness was later elected to the state Senate in Washington in 1988. During a flag amendment debate, Thorsness spoke publicly for the first time about Mike Christian's flag.
""Every other senator turned their heads and looked at me,"" Thorsness said.
The story was later published in 1992 in Reader's Digest.
Several details in Thorsness' account differ from McCain's recollection, such as whether the handkerchief was a rag found in the prison yard or, as McCain tells it, part of a care package allowed in by the guards. But the stories are substantially the same. We rule McCain's story True.",1,Chain email
"""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before."" American manufacturing is more than just a shaded slice in a pie chart showing what makes the country’s economy tick. In the popular mind, it’s a measure of how well the nation competes in the world and whether ""we still make things.""
So during a speech in Arizona, when President Barack Obama was listing the ways the economy has recovered, he made a point to include American exports.
""We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before,"" Obama said.
It’s worth noting that the president specifically referred to ""products made in America"" in contrast to a broader view on trade that blends both goods and services. The data check on Obama’s claim is straightforward.
When tallying sales of everything from bushels of wheat to jet engines, the standard unit of measurement is dollars. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Commerce Department helps pull together the country’s trade statistics. The bureau’s June report showed the U.S. exported more than $134 billion worth of goods that month. That indeed is the largest dollar amount ever, even accounting for inflation. There are two important pieces of context for these numbers -- the impact of the recession and the overall trade deficit. We’ll look at the role of the recession first.
Trade numbers can bounce around from month to month so we compared the total amount of goods sold in the first half of 2013 to the first half of the years right before and after the recession.
The recession took a big bite out of trade as the global economy locked up. The sale of goods fell by nearly a quarter from 2008 to 2009, again, just looking at the first half of each year. The rebound however was pretty quick. By 2011, sales were higher than just before the recession hit and they’ve continued to rise.
But the rate of increase has slowed considerably. Andrew Bernard, a trade economist at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, runs the numbers a little differently but sees the same trend. The total dollars go up, but not as fast.
""Touting the current numbers as the best ever is a bit disingenuous as, by my calculations, the last 12 months are up 1.4 percent over the previous 12,"" Bernard said. ""Not exactly booming.""
Still, Bernard notes that when the country’s biggest trading partners face economic headwinds, one should expect American exports to suffer.
""Europe has been pretty stagnant, and Chinese growth has been slowing, so any increase might actually be good news,"" he said. Bernard said both Europe and Asia are showing signs of improvement which he expects to help U.S. exports down the line.
The balance of trade
Generally speaking, strong economies sell more to others than they buy in return. This is an area where countries like China and Germany historically have done quite well and where the U.S. has struggled. When President Obama cheered the record level of sales for American products, that didn’t address the country’s trade deficit. However, while the U.S.  is still in the red on trade, the news here also is slightly better than in the past.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the deficit for goods dropped nearly $10 billion between May and June. The average monthly deficit over the past 12 months has been about $59.5 billion. In June, it was about $53 billion.
The sale of capital goods, things like construction equipment and machinery, did the most to boost the numbers. There was a $2.3 billion rise over the past 12 months.
While the focus of this check is on goods, the sale of services regularly generates surpluses of about $18 billion to $19 billion a month that help offset the nation’s overall trade deficit. But even with that, the trade deficit for the past 12 months stands at $540 billion.",1,Barack Obama
"If we got solar energy from ""an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year."" Al Gore startled a Senate committee with an optimistic scheme for harnessing the sun's energy.
The former vice president sketched out the idea at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on climate change where he was the star witness.
""A technology called 'concentrating solar thermal' is now becoming very competitive,"" Gore said at the Jan. 28, 2009, hearing. ""
Scientific American
pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year.""
In January 2008,
Scientific American
published an influential article titled ""A Solar Grand Plan.""
A conservative writer immediately attacked Gore's claim. The
Scientific American
article ""did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side, which is 10,000 square miles,"" William Tucker of the
American Spectator
wrote a day after Gore's testimony. ""The article stated, 'To meet the 2050 projection [of electrical demand], 46,000 square miles of land would be needed...""
Gore's spokeswoman, Kallee Kreider, said Gore had cited the wrong source — he intended to cite this report from Environment America, an advocacy group that promotes clean energy.
That report in turn cites the U.S. Energy Department, which does indeed say on this Web page , ""The solar energy resource in a 100-mile-square area of Nevada [otherwise known as 100-miles-squared, or 10,000 square miles] could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient (10%) commercial photovoltaic modules.""
That's a compelling source, but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder. So we called two of the authors of the
Scientific American
piece, James Mason and Ken Zweibel. They said that Gore was probably correct, and in fact their article — far from contradicting his claim — contains data that support it.
Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46,000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050, they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country's energy than it does now — including, for example, 344 million plug-in hybrid vehicles.
A 10,000-square-mile solar plant could well provide
today's
electricity needs, they said.
Here's how (dense math ahead; proceed with caution):
As graphics accompanying the print version of the
Scientific American
piece indicate, the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation.
Take that 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2,372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. We'll round it to 2,400.
Solar-electric systems could — optimistically — convert about 15 percent of that to electricity. That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year.
You can't cram solar panels close together, because they would cast shadows on each other. For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern U.S., you need 2.5 square meters of space. Once you account for that (by dividing 360 by 2.5), you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year.
There are 25.9 billion square meters in 10,000 square miles. Multiply that 25.9 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year, and you get 3,729 billion kilowatt hours per year.
The U.S. consumes about 3,900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration .
So Gore's estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved.
""I don't think you've found a serious blunder,"" said Zweibel, director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University.
""Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology,"" said Mason, director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale, N.Y.
That said, there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10,000-square-mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds.
For one, we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days. Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns, old mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity.
Also, we would need a vast new system of transmission lines. To pay for that and other necessary improvements, Mason and Zweibel call for $420 billion of government subsidies.
Even given all the challenges, they, like Gore, argue large-scale solar development makes sense when you consider the enormous amounts of land, energy and money we currently use to mine fossil fuels, produce electricity from them and control their pollution.
Gore didn't exactly tell the whole story, since the 10,000-square-mile solar farm would not do the job ""in and of itself"" without other infrastructure improvements. But he was testifying on the broad issue of climate change, not delivering a lecture on building a solar plant. And his misattributing the claim to
Scientific American
is not a significant inaccuracy, since that article did contain statistics that support the claim.",1,Al Gore
"""More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock."" In the middle of a national conversation about race following the George Zimmerman acquittal, CNN anchor Don Lemon gave an on-air commentary that went viral on social media. The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. ""Black people,"" Lemon said, ""if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing.""
The No. 1 item on that list -- ""and probably the most important,"" he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births.
""Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,"" Lemon said. ""Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.""
Lemon’s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- the website Mediaite published a sampling -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions.
""If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people,"" wrote Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam . ""Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor.""
We can’t check Lemon’s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock""?
We turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a report every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010.
The report broke down statistics by ethnic groups. Here’s a summary
So Lemon is correct that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock."" To make sure we weren’t missing something, we asked two population experts -- Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Massey, professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research -- and they agreed that the statistic is the best available.
Lemon did overreach somewhat when he went on to say that the 72 percent ""out of wedlock"" figure ""means absent fathers."" The 72 percent figure refers to children who are born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present.
That said, the rate of African-American children living in single-parent homes is almost as high as the rate for non-marital births.
The chart below summarizes 2011 Census Bureau data compiled by Kids Count , a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The group defined ""children in single-parent families"" as kids under 18 who live with their own single parent; it includes children living with a parent and a cohabiting adult, but it does not include children living with married step-parents.
We should note that this data doesn’t suggest that 67 percent of African-American children have no contact with their father (or a father figure), but rather that their father does not live in the same household with them.",1,Don Lemon
"Since 1968, ""more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history."" Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., supporters and opponents of gun control have thrown out statistics to support their point of view.
Here’s one that caught our eye, offered by liberal commentator Mark Shields on the Dec. 21, 2012, edition of the PBS NewsHour .
Shields told host Judy Woodruff, ""You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years. ... I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.""
Is the death toll that high? Let's examine each half of his comparison.
Deaths from warfare
We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org . Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" -- that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat.
Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict:
Another 362 deaths resulted from other conflicts since 1980, such as interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti, but the number is not large enough to make a difference.
Gunfire deaths
The number of deaths from gunfire is a bit more complicated to total. Two Internet-accessible data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow us to pin down the number of deaths from 1981 to 1998 and from 1999 to 2010. We’ve added FBI figures for 2011, and we offer a number for 1968 to 1980 using a conservative estimate of data we found in a graph in this 1994 paper published by the CDC .
Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:
We should note that these figures refer to all gun-fire related deaths -- not just homicides, but also suicides and accidental deaths. In 2011, about one-quarter of firearm-related deaths were homicides, according to FBI and CDC data. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone.
When we rated a previous Facebook post , we lowered an otherwise True claim to Mostly True because it said that ""nearly 100,000 people get shot every year."" We found that the number of gun deaths and non-fatal injuries added up to 104,852, but we concluded that the term ""get shot"" could suggest victims who got shot by someone else rather than by their own hand. We don’t see a similar problem with the way Shields’ comment was phrased -- namely, ""died from gunfire.""",1,Mark Shields
"In a now-viral video, ""impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey ... have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'"" When we first saw a copy of the now-viral video of young school kids singing the praises of President Barack Obama on Sept. 24 (""Hooray, Mr. President, we honor your great plans/To make this country's economy No. 1 again!""), we looked at our watches to see how long it would take for Republican leaders to react.
Turned out, not long.
The following morning, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sent out a blast e-mail with a link to the video and a plea for donations to the RNC to ""fight this leftist propaganda and elect more Republicans this year and next.""
The issue also made the rounds on political radio and TV talk shows. Fox News' Sean Hannity and Kimberly Guilfoyle talked about whether Hannity's head would spontaneously combust or simply explode if his kid had been among those at the school.
""That's not too creepy,"" Fox News host Glenn Beck said sarcastically on his Sept. 24 show after showing a clip of the video. ""Did anybody in the room stop and think for a second, 'Wait a minute. I really wouldn't want my kids chanting a song about George W. Bush, so maybe I shouldn't do it with this one?'""
By Friday, the number of people who had viewed the video neared half a million.
In his e-mail, Steele said he was so stunned and outraged by the video, he felt the need to circulate it immediately.
""In the video, impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than six or seven years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama,'"" Steele wrote.
""Friend, this is the type of propaganda you would see in Stalin's Russia or Kim Jong Il's North Korea. I never thought the day would come when I'd see it here in America.""
You can argue whether or not Steele laid the political rhetoric on a little too thick.
The fact we wanted to check was the question that immediately popped into our head when we saw the video, ""Did this really happen at a
public
school?""
The short answer is yes. It happened at B. Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township, N.J. That's a public school in the Burlington Township School District. In the video, about 18 second-graders are in an auditorium singing two songs about Obama.
Here are some lyrics to the first song:
""Mm, mmm, mmm!
Barack Hussein Obama
He said that all must lend a hand
To make this country strong again
Mmm, mmm, mm!
Barack Hussein Obama
He said we must be fair today
Equal work means equal pay
Mmm, mmm, mmm!""
The second song is set to the tune of
The Battle Hymn of the Republic
.
""Hello, Mr. President we honor you today!
For all your great accomplishments, we all doth say ""hooray!""
Hooray, Mr. President! You're number one!
The first black American to lead this great nation!
Hooray, Mr. President we honor your great plans
To make this country's economy No. 1 again!""
According to school district officials, the video was shot in February 2009 and was part of a program to recognize famous and accomplished African-Americans during Black History Month.
""There was no intention to indoctrinate children,"" District Superintendent Christopher Manno said in a released statement. ""There was no political agenda underlying the activity.""
The New Jersey Department of Education also responded via prepared statement.
""The commissioner has directed the superintendent to conduct a thorough review of what happened to ensure students can celebrate the achievements of African-Americans during Black History Month without inappropriate partisan politics in the classroom, as well as ensuring the privacy of children is not violated,"" said Beth Auerswald, a spokeswoman for the district. ""In addition, it is our understanding the teacher in question retired at the end of the last school year.""
It's unclear who wrote the lyrics or shot the video. In a note to parents and the media on Sept. 24, Superintendent Manno said ""the recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized."" Fox News reported that the video was originally posted on the Internet by Charisse Carney-Nunes, author of the children's book
I Am Barack Obama.
We sent an e-mail to the address on Carney-Nunes' Web site and received a response that, ""At this time, Charisse has no comment for press.""
On Friday, Fox News caught up with a few parents in the drop-off line at B. Bernice Young Elementary School. Opinions varied about the appropriateness of the songs.
Next stop Stalinist Russia? We'll leave that to parents, school officials and political pundits to argue about. We were checking Steele's comment that ""impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than 6 or 7 years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'""
Yes, they were second-graders, which makes them 7 or 8 years old, and therefore, ""impressionable."" And the video shows the teacher directing them to sing. Most importantly, this was at a public school.",1,Michael Steele
"Says she ""is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors (John) Kasich and (Chris) Christie combined."" When Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was denied a spot in a debate just days before the New Hampshire primary, she took to Medium to argue her case .
Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, compared herself to some other Republican candidates in the race, including Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.
She wrote, ""Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter:
""In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich.
""She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0.
""Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined.""
Fiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina’s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals.
(For the record, she was right on both of the previous two bullet points. Fiorina got 3,485 votes in Iowa , or 1.9 percent, which was ahead of Kasich by 11 votes and ahead of Christie by 201 votes. That translated into one delegate each for Bush and Fiorina and none for Christie.)
For fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data .
Here’s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate’s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.)
So Fiorina was indeed sixth on the list. That’s not saying a whole lot -- she was ahead of only two candidates, and she had barely half the amount of the fifth-place finisher.
How about cash on hand, which means money raised minus money already spent?
Fiorina was right that she had more cash on hand than Kasich and Christie combined; they totaled $3,663,459. Here too, that’s no great shakes -- she still ranks sixth of the eight candidates in cash on hand",1,Carly Fiorina
"""I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York."" Ted Cruz got whomped by Donald Trump in the New York primary. But in remarks in Borden, Ind., Cruz tried to take some solace by looking at the numbers a different way.
""I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York,"" Cruz said .
Is that right? We took a closer look.
Here’s the final results of the April 5, 2016, Wisconsin Republican primary, according to the Associated Press :
And here are the final results of the April 19 New York Republican primary:
So Cruz did win more raw votes in Wisconsin (531,129) than Trump did in New York (524,932). It’s a modest edge -- Cruz won about 1.1 percent more votes in Wisconsin than Trump did in New York -- but an edge nonetheless.
The discrepancy owes much to two factors: Wisconsin’s turnout rate , which was two and a half times higher than New York’s, and the Republicans’ greater strength in purplish Wisconsin than in solidly blue New York.
In Wisconsin, about 24 percent of the voting-age population cast a Republican primary ballot. In New York, it was just 5.6 percent.
That helps explain why Cruz eked out more raw votes than Trump even though Trump won the much bigger state and almost three times as many delegates.",1,Ted Cruz
"""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" In a speech posted on Medium , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth.
""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.""
We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look.
We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form , we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.
So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct.
If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.
There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.
We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.
That said, we think Clinton’s definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.",1,Hillary Clinton
"The economy is ""creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."" President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was notable for its celebratory language about the state of the economy, following a recovery that was widely considered long and slow.
Here’s one of the claims Obama made: ""Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.""
We initially read this to mean that both the economy and the number of jobs had been growing at the fastest pace since 1999. That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren’t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United States is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.
The first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren’t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama’s claim that the economy is ""creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.""
Looking at job growth over the course of the calendar year
We looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found:
So Obama’s on target: The job growth during calendar year 2014 was higher than any year going back to 1999.
Adding some context
That said, the current recovery is hardly perfect.
There have been three clear periods of job growth over the past quarter century. We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted.
Here’s the breakdown of the three job expansions:
This shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade.",1,Barack Obama
"Like Marco Rubio, Sen. Barack Obama had ""one of the worst attendance records in the Senate."" A commercial by the super PAC Right to Rise USA shows a silhouette of Sen. Marco Rubio and criticizes him for his lack of foreign policy experience.
""Way too often, Rubio didn't even show up,"" the announcer says as a box on the screen tags Rubio as having ""one of the worst attendance records in the Senate.""
Almost imperceptibly, the silhouette morphs into President Barack Obama as the announcer asks, ""What other junior senator had the same resume?""
Right to Rise USA is the super PAC that supported Jeb Bush, who has given up on his quest for the White House this year. According to the TV Political Ad Archive , it ran at least 400 times, mostly in South Carolina before Bush dropped out.
We decided to see if both Rubio and Obama have had similar attendance records in the Senate.
First, a word about terminology. In political circles, attendance is usually determined not by the number of days you show up for work in the Senate, but by the number of votes you miss. We'll use that standard.
Rubio has been dealing with the attendance issue since the summer, when he had been missing more than half of all Senate roll call votes.
Here's the rundown as of March 4, according to GovTrack.us, which has a running tally of voting records for members of Congress.
Rubio has missed 14.9 percent of the votes since taking office in January 2011. The typical senator currently serving has missed just 1.7 percent.
His record has never been exemplary, but it really deteriorated starting in the first quarter of 2015, when he missed 18.5 percent, then 32.9 percent in the second quarter, 53.8 percent in the third and 58.2 percent in the fourth. Since January he has missed more than nine in 10 votes.
Obama , during his four years as a senator, missed 24.2 percent of his votes. During his time in the Senate, the median for missed votes was 2.2 percent.
Sen. Obama had a great voting record until the second quarter of 2007, when he missed 17.9 percent of the votes, followed by 56.3 percent in the third quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, with the election a year away, he was missing 89.4 percent.
This chart shows the percent of missed votes for comparable quarters during the campaign season for both senators as the clock ticked down to election day. We've highlighted who missed more votes in each quarter.
More to the point for this fact check, GovTrack has ranked Rubio compared to his colleagues based on the number of votes he's missed in the past year and the year before that. The Florida senator is in the 100th percentile — the worst — for the 12-month period and in the 95th percentile — almost as bad — for the previous 12 months.
At this stage of Obama's campaign, the Illinois senator's record for missed votes in the previous 12 months put him in the 98th percentile. He was in the 32nd percentile the year before that.",1,Right to Rise
"""Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member."" Bernie Sanders is often criticized for "" pie - in - the - sky "" proposals and impractical ideals, but his campaign argues the Vermont senator actually gets things done.
""Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member,"" according to a TV ad paid for by the Sanders campaign.
A version of this ad appears on Sanders’ YouTube channel, and Sanders has made this claim on Twitter and Facebook as well so we wondered if it was true.
The Sanders campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that this carefully worded statement is accurate for his earlier years in Congress.
The ‘amendment king’
Sanders served in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2006 and has been in the Senate since then. Republicans were in control of the House from 1995 to 2007 and of the Senate from 2015 to present.
In 2005, Rolling Stone named Sanders the "" amendment king "" of the House. At the time, the title held true with a specific qualification: amendments agreed to by record votes. (Amendments can also be passed with voice votes, in which the volume of yeas and nays dictates passage, or by unanimous consent, in which no one raises an objection.)
Out of 419 amendments Sanders sponsored over his 25 years in Congress, 90 passed , 21 of them by roll call votes. Here’s a breakdown (bold indicates Republican Congresses):
From 1995 to 2007, Sanders passed 17 amendments by a recorded roll call vote — more than any other member in the House.
Ohio Democrat James Traficant came in second with 16 roll call amendments , but he served five less years than Sanders after being indicted on several corruption charges in 2002 and then expelled from Congress. If we look at all amendments, not just those passed by roll call votes, Traficant passed 72 more than Sanders.
New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, who served in the same time period as Sanders, finished third with 14 roll call amendments (and 32 overall amendments).
Craig Volden, an expert on the legislative process at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that records like these are rather unusual in the House.
""There are so few members with large numbers of substantive and successful amendments,"" he said. ""Sanders and Traficant were exceptions to that rule.""
In comparison, Hillary Clinton passed zero roll call amendments during her tenure as a senator from New York from 2001-09.
Overall effectiveness
In the current Congress, Sanders ranks fourth when it comes to the number of career roll call amendments passed, according GovTrack founder, Josh Tauberer. The three lawmakers who top him are Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., with 27 in 15 years in Congress; Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., with 24 in 33 years; and Rep Steve King, R-Iowa, with 22 in 13 years.
Roll call amendments aside, Sanders isn’t shattering any legislative records, though he’s not doing poorly either. Tauberer’s research places Sanders at No. 14 in Congress with 90 amendments. The other senator from Vermont, Democrat Patrick Leahy, on the other hand, has passed 226.
Of course, amendments are just one of the ways lawmakers press their agendas. Sanders has had much less luck with passing bills.
During his 25 years in Congress, Sanders introduced 324 bills , three of which became law . This includes a bill in a Republican Congress naming a post office in Vermont and two more while Democrats had control (one naming another Vermont post office and another increasing veterans’ disability compensation). Clinton, for the record, also passed three bills in eight years.
But the sparse number of bills isn’t surprising. Volden and Vanderbilt University’s Alan Wiseman assess the legislative effectiveness of House members by comparing their records to a benchmark. According to this analysis, Sanders has either met or exceeded expectations during his tenure in the House (bold indicates Republican Congresses):
Lawmakers who belong to the party in control are five times more likely to have their bills go anywhere than minority party members, according to Volden. So Sanders’ legislative approach may seem like fixating on small potatoes, but for an independent who caucuses with the minority party, it’s a smart strategy.
""He could have either resigned himself to that fate, changed the nature of his legislation and coalition-building strategy, or offered amendments on the floor,"" Volden said. ""He chose the third of these paths, making him more influential in shaping policy than if he had taken the first path. Why he did not take the second path is an open question — likely linked to his ideological views.""",1,Bernie Sanders
"""Obama has more czars than the Romanovs."" How many czars does it take to run the federal government? More and more, it seems.
In a Twitter message on May 30, 2009, Sen. John McCain took this poke at the Obama administration:
""Obama has more czars than the Romanovs — who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20.""
First of all, yes, John McCain — the guy criticized during the presidential campaign for being computer illiterate — is tweeting.
But what about the czars? It sure seems like we keep reading about one czar after another being appointed to oversee the auto industry, the Great Lakes, and the closure of Gitmo, and we wondered: Just how many czars does the Obama administration actually have?
First off, the Obama administration doesn't usually call any of these people czars. We only found two instances of President Barack Obama using the term, once in an April 15, 2009, interview with
CNN En Espanol
when he talked about the role of his ""border czar,"" and once during the campaign when he promised to appoint an ""autism czar"" to coordinate a nationwide autism effort (he hasn't yet). And in announcing Obama's nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Vice President Joe Biden referred to the position as ""our nation's drug czar.""
We're sure there are more, but the point is that, by and large, you don't often hear the administration talking about its czars.
In fact, the administration has at times gone to some lengths to avoid the moniker, as was the case in this somewhat humorous (in an inside-the-Beltway sorta way) exchange between a reporter and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on June 10, 2009:
Reporter: On Ken Feinberg, I think that he's maybe the 20th czar-type position you've named.
Gibbs:  No, I think the title is ""special master.""
So who exactly qualifies as a czar? As best we can tell, it's whenever someone in the media says so. You can identify a guy as ""Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Co-Chair of the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology,"" but it's a lot easier on everyone to just say ""Science Czar."" And ""Special Master"" sounds like Richie Rich's best friend.
So the title of czar is largely arbitrary media shorthand for ""It's this person's job to make sure (blank) goes right."" And we think everyone can agree that ""Terrorism Czar"" sounds way cooler than ""Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security.""
Below, we have compiled a wildly unscientific list of Obama administration ""czars."" But we're not the first. Talking Points Memo has a slideshow of Obama's ""czars."" They count 23 . And ForeignPolicy.com came up with at least 18. We've got 28.
Some of these ""czars"" are carryover positions from previous administrations. And ""czars"" go way back in presidential history. Roosevelt had a slew of so-called czars. But to the extent that Obama has created a number of new positions to oversee various issues and to cut through bureaucratic red tape, he seems to have a lot more czars than his predecessors. Or you could argue that the media has just seized on a new buzzword it likes. We're not going to wade into the debate about whether having more czars is a good idea, but Fox ran a story about concerns some lawmakers have with it.
We're just fact-checking McCain's claim that Obama has more czars than the Romanovs. According to the
World Book Encyclopedia
, there were, as McCain said, 18 Romanov czars, starting with Michael Romanov in 1613 and ending with Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
As for Obama's czars, we've got 28 who have been referred to as a czar ... somewhere. Undoubtedly some will take issue with some of the ""czars"" on our list, but we think McCain is on solid ground. He earns a True.",1,John McCain
